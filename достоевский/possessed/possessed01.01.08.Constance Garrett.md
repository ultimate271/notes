After this we had a period of stagnation which lasted nine years. The
hysterical outbreaks and sobbings on my shoulder that recurred at regular
intervals did not in the least mar our prosperity. I wonder that Stepan
Trofimovitch did not grow stout during this period. His nose was a little
redder, and his manner had gained in urbanity, that was all. By degrees a
circle of friends had formed around him, although it was never a very large
one. Though Varvara Petrovna had little to do with the circle, yet we all
recognised her as our patroness. After the lesson she had received in
Petersburg, she settled down in our town for good. In winter she lived in her
town house and spent the summer on her estate in the neighbourhood. She had
never enjoyed so much consequence and prestige in our provincial society as
during the last seven years of this period, that is up to the time of the
appointment of our present governor. Our former governor, the mild Ivan
Ossipovitch, who will never be forgotten among us, was a near relation of
Varvara Petrovna's, and had at one time been under obligations to her. His wife
trembled at the very thought of displeasing her, while the homage paid her by
provincial society was carried almost to a pitch that suggested idolatry. So
Stepan Trofimovitch, too, had a good time. He was a member of the club, lost at
cards majestically, and was everywhere treated with respect, though many people
regarded him only as a "learned man." Later on, when Varvara Petrovna allowed
him to live in a separate house, we enjoyed greater freedom than before. Twice
a week we used to meet at his house. We were a merry party, especially when he
was not sparing of the champagne. The wine came from the shop of the same
Andreev. The bill was paid twice a year by Varvara Petrovna, and on the day it
was paid Stepan Trofimovitch almost invariably suffered from an attack of his
"summer cholera."

## On Liputin
[TreeTag]: # {01.01.08.01.01}
[Character]: # {Varvara Petrovna Stavrogin}
[Character]: # {Liputin}
One of the first members of our circle was Liputin, an elderly provincial
official, and a great liberal, who was reputed in the town to be an atheist. He
had married for the second time a young and pretty wife with a dowry, and had,
besides, three grown-up daughters. He brought up his family in the fear of God,
and kept a tight hand over them. He was extremely stingy, and out of his salary
had bought himself a house and amassed a fortune. He was an uncomfortable sort
of man, and had not been in the service. He was not much respected in the town,
and was not received in the best circles. Moreover, he was a scandal-monger,
and had more than once had to smart for his back-biting, for which he had been
badly punished by an officer, and again by a country gentleman, the respectable
head of a family. But we liked his wit, his inquiring mind, his peculiar,
malicious liveliness. Varvara Petrovna disliked him, but he always knew how to
make up to her.

[Character]: # {Shatov}

### Shotov's upbringing and heritage
[TreeTag]: # {01.01.08.01.02.01}
Nor did she care for Shatov, who became one of our circle during the last years
of this period. Shatov had been a student and had been expelled from the
university after some disturbance. In his childhood he had been a student of
Stepan Trofimovitch's and was by birth a serf of Varvara Petrovna's, the son of
a former valet of hers, Pavel Fyodoritch, and was greatly indebted to her
bounty. She disliked him for his pride and ingratitude and could never forgive
him for not having come straight to her on his expulsion from the university.
On the contrary he had not even answered the letter she had expressly sent him
at the time, and preferred to be a drudge in the family of a merchant of the
new style, with whom he went abroad, looking after his children more in the
position of a nurse than of a tutor. He was very eager to travel at the time.
The children had a governess too, a lively young Russian lady, who also became
one of the household on the eve of their departure, and had been engaged
chiefly because she was so cheap. Two months later the merchant turned her out
of the house for "free thinking." Shatov took himself off after her and soon
afterwards married her in Geneva. They lived together about three weeks, and
then parted as free people recognising no bonds, though, no doubt, also through
poverty. He wandered about Europe alone for a long time afterwards, living God
knows how; he is said to have blacked boots in the street, and to have been a
porter in some dockyard. At last, a year before, he had returned to his native
place among us and settled with an old aunt, whom he buried a month later. His
sister Dasha, who had also been brought up by Varvara Petrovna, was a favourite
of hers, and treated with respect and consideration in her house. He saw his
sister rarely and was not on intimate terms with her. In our circle he was
always sullen, and never talkative; but from time to time, when his convictions
were touched upon, he became morbidly irritable and very unrestrained in his
language.

### Stepan comments on Stepan
[TreeTag]: # {01.01.08.01.02.02}
[Speaker]: # {Stepan Trofimovitch Verhovensky}
"One has to tie Shatov up and then argue with him," Stepan Trofimovitch would
sometimes say in joke, but he liked him.

### Shatov's ideas
[TreeTag]: # {01.01.08.01.02.03}
Shatov had radically changed some of his former socialistic convictions abroad
and had rushed to the opposite extreme. He was one of those idealistic beings
common in Russia, who are suddenly struck by some overmastering idea which
seems, as it were, to crush them at once, and sometimes forever. They are never
equal to coping with it, but put passionate faith in it, and their whole life
passes afterwards, as it were, in the last agonies under the weight of the
stone that has fallen upon them and half crushed them. In appearance Shatov was
in complete harmony with his convictions: he was short, awkward, had a shock of
flaxen hair, broad shoulders, thick lips, very thick overhanging white
eyebrows, a wrinkled forehead, and a hostile, obstinately downcast, as it were
shamefaced, expression in his eyes. His hair was always in a wild tangle and
stood up in a shock which nothing could smooth. He was seven- or
eight-and-twenty.

### Incident with Shatov and Varvara
[TreeTag]: # {01.01.08.01.02.04}
[Actor]: # {Varvara Petrovna Stavrogin}
[Actor]: # {Shatov}
[Character]: # {Liputin}
"I no longer wonder that his wife ran away from him," Varvara Petrovna
enunciated on one occasion after gazing intently at him. He tried to be neat in
his dress, in spite of his extreme poverty. He refrained again from appealing
to Varvara Petrovna, and struggled along as best he could, doing various jobs
for tradespeople. At one time he served in a shop, at another he was on the
point of going as an assistant clerk on a freight steamer, but he fell ill just
at the time of sailing. It is hard to imagine what poverty he was capable of
enduring without thinking about it at all. After his illness Varvara Petrovna
sent him a hundred roubles, anonymously and in secret. He found out the secret,
however, and after some reflection took the money and went to Varvara Petrovna
to thank her. She received him with warmth, but on this occasion, too, he
shamefully disappointed her. He only stayed five minutes, staring blankly at
the ground and smiling stupidly in profound silence, and suddenly, at the most
interesting point, without listening to what she was saying, he got up, made an
uncouth sideways bow, helpless with confusion, caught against the lady's
expensive inlaid work-table, upsetting it on the floor and smashing it to
atoms, and walked out nearly dead with shame. Liputin blamed him severely
afterwards for having accepted the hundred roubles and having even gone to
thank Varvara Petrovna for them, instead of having returned the money with
contempt, because it had come from his former despotic mistress. He lived in
solitude on the outskirts of the town, and did not like any of us to go and see
him. He used to turn up invariably at Stepan Trofimovitch's evenings, and
borrowed newspapers and books from him.

## On Virginsky
[TreeTag]: # {01.01.08.01.03}
[Character]: # {Madame Virginsky}
[Character]: # {Virginsky}
There was another young man who always came, one Virginsky, a clerk in the
service here, who had something in common with Shatov, though on the surface he
seemed his complete opposite in every respect. He was a "family man" too. He
was a pathetic and very quiet young man though he was thirty; he had
considerable education though he was chiefly self-taught. He was poor, married,
and in the service, and supported the aunt and sister of his wife. His wife and
all the ladies of his family professed the very latest convictions, but in
rather a crude form. It was a case of "an idea dragged forth into the street,"
as Stepan Trofimovitch had expressed it upon a former occasion. They got it all
out of books, and at the first hint coming from any of our little progressive
corners in Petersburg they were prepared to throw anything overboard, so soon
as they were advised to do so. Madame Virginsky practised as a midwife in the
town. She had lived a long while in Petersburg as a girl. Virginsky himself was
a man of rare single-heartedness, and I have seldom met more honest fervour.

### Stepan gives his opinions of his some of his circle of friends

[Speaker]: # {Stepan Trofimovitch Verhovensky}
[Character]: # {Virginsky}
[Character]: # {Shatov}
[Character]: # {Liputin}
"I will never, never, abandon these bright hopes," he used to say to me with
shining eyes. Of these "bright hopes" he always spoke quietly, in a blissful
half-whisper, as it were secretly. He was rather tall, but extremely thin and
narrow-shouldered, and had extraordinarily lank hair of a reddish hue. All
Stepan Trofimovitch's condescending gibes at some of his opinions he accepted
mildly, answered him sometimes very seriously, and often nonplussed him. Stepan
Trofimovitch treated him very kindly, and indeed he behaved like a father to
all of us. "You are all half-hearted chickens," he observed to Virginsky in
joke. "All who are like you, though in you, Virginsky, I have not observed that
narrow-mindedness I found in Petersburg, _chez ces séminaristes_. But you're a
half-hatched chicken all the same. Shatov would give anything to hatch out, but
he's half-hatched too."

"And I?" Liputin inquired.

"You're simply the golden mean which will get on anywhere in its own way."
Liputin was offended.

### The incident between Virginsky and his wife
[TreeTag]: # {01.01.08.01.03.02}
[Actor]: # {Virginsky}
[Actor]: # {Madame Virginsky}
[Actor]: # {Lebyadkin}
The story was told of Virginsky, and it was unhappily only too true, that
before his wife had spent a year in lawful wedlock with him she announced that
he was superseded and that she preferred Lebyadkin. This Lebyadkin, a stranger
to the town, turned out afterwards to be a very dubious character, and not a
retired captain as he represented himself to be. He could do nothing but twist
his moustache, drink, and chatter the most inept nonsense that can possibly be
imagined. This fellow, who was utterly lacking in delicacy, at once settled in
his house, glad to live at another man's expense, ate and slept there and came,
in the end, to treating the master of the house with condescension. It was
asserted that when Virginsky's wife had announced to him that he was superseded
he said to her:

"My dear, hitherto I have only loved you, but now I respect you," but I doubt
whether this renunciation, worthy of ancient Rome, was ever really uttered. On
the contrary they say that he wept violently. A fortnight after he was
superseded, all of them, in a "family party," went one day for a picnic to a
wood outside the town to drink tea with their friends. Virginsky was in a
feverishly lively mood and took part in the dances. But suddenly, without any
preliminary quarrel, he seized the giant Lebyadkin with both hands, by the
hair, just as the latter was dancing a can-can solo, pushed him down, and began
dragging him along with shrieks, shouts, and tears. The giant was so
panic-stricken that he did not attempt to defend himself, and hardly uttered a
sound all the time he was being dragged along. But afterwards he resented it
with all the heat of an honourable man. Virginsky spent a whole night on his
knees begging his wife's forgiveness. But this forgiveness was not granted, as
he refused to apologise to Lebyadkin; moreover, he was upbraided for the
meanness of his ideas and his foolishness, the latter charge based on the fact
that he knelt down in the interview with his wife. The captain soon disappeared
and did not reappear in our town till quite lately, when he came with his
sister, and with entirely different aims; but of him later. It was no wonder
that the poor young husband sought our society and found comfort in it. But he
never spoke of his home-life to us. On one occasion only, returning with me
from Stepan Trofimovitch's, he made a remote allusion to his position, but
clutching my hand at once he cried ardently:

### Virginsky assures that this incident is not a hindrance to the cause.
[TreeTag]: # {01.01.08.01.03.03}
[Speaker]: # {Virginsky}
"It's of no consequence. It's only a personal incident. It's no hindrance to
the 'cause,' not the slightest!"

## Some other characters
[TreeTag]: # {01.01.08.01.04}
[Character]: # {Slontsevsky}
[Character]: # {Captain Kartusov}
[Character]: # {Lyamshin}
Stray guests visited our circle too; a Jew, called Lyamshin, and a Captain
Kartusov came. An old gentleman of inquiring mind used to come at one time, but
he died. Liputin brought an exiled Polish priest called Slontsevsky, and for a
time we received him on principle, but afterwards we didn't keep it up.
