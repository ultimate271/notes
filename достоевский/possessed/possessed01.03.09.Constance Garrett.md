I had only just lifted my leg over the high barrier across the bottom of the
gateway, when suddenly a strong hand clutched at my chest.

"Who's this?" roared a voice, "a friend or an enemy? Own up!"

"He's one of us; one of us!" Liputin's voice squealed near by. "It's Mr.
G----v, a young man of classical education, in touch with the highest society."

"I love him if he's in society, clas-si... that means he's high-ly ed-u-cated.
The retired Captain Ignat Lebyadkin, at the service of the world and his
friends... if they're true ones, if they're true ones, the scoundrels."

Captain Lebyadkin, a stout, fleshy man over six feet in height, with curly hair
and a red face, was so extremely drunk that he could scarcely stand up before
me, and articulated with difficulty. I had seen him before, however, in the
distance.

"And this one!" he roared again, noticing Kirillov, who was still standing with
the lantern; he raised his fist, but let it fall again at once.

"I forgive you for your learning! Ignat Lebyadkin--high-ly ed-u-cated....

'A bomb of love with stinging smart      Exploded in Ignaty's heart. In anguish
dire I weep again      The arm that at Sevastopol      I lost in bitter pain!'

Not that I ever was at Sevastopol, or ever lost my arm, but you know what rhyme
is." He pushed up to me with his ugly, tipsy face.

"He is in a hurry, he is going home!" Liputin tried to persuade him. "He'll
tell Lizaveta Nikolaevna to-morrow."

"Lizaveta!" he yelled again. "Stay, don't go!

A variation:      'Among the Amazons a star,      Upon her steed she flashes
by,      And smiles upon me from afar,      The child of aris-to-cra-cy! To a
Starry Amazon.'

You know that's a hymn. It's a hymn, if you're not an ass! The duffers, they
don't understand! Stay!"

He caught hold of my coat, though I pulled myself away with all my might.

"Tell her I'm a knight and the soul of honour, and as for that Dasha... I'd
pick her up and chuck her out.... She's only a serf, she daren't..."

At this point he fell down, for I pulled myself violently out of his hands and
ran into the street. Liputin clung on to me.

"Alexey Nilitch will pick him up. Do you know what I've just found out from
him?" he babbled in desperate haste. "Did you hear his verses? He's sealed
those verses to the 'Starry Amazon' in an envelope and is going to send them
to-morrow to Lizaveta Nikolaevna, signed with his name in full. What a fellow!"

"I bet you suggested it to him yourself."

"You'll lose your bet," laughed Liputin. "He's in love, in love like a cat, and
do you know it began with hatred. He hated Lizaveta Nikolaevna at first so
much, for riding on horseback that he almost swore aloud at her in the street.
Yes, he did abuse her! Only the day before yesterday he swore at her when she
rode by--luckily she didn't hear. And, suddenly, to-day--poetry! Do you know he
means to risk a proposal? Seriously! Seriously!"

"I wonder at you, Liputin; whenever there's anything nasty going on you're
always on the spot taking a leading part in it," I said angrily.

"You're going rather far, Mr. G----v. Isn't your poor little heart quaking,
perhaps, in terror of a rival?"

"Wha-at!" I cried, standing still.

"Well, now to punish you I won't say anything more, and wouldn't you like to
know though? Take this alone, that that lout is not a simple captain now but a
landowner of our province, and rather an important one, too, for Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch sold him all his estate the other day, formerly of two hundred
serfs; and as God's above, I'm not lying. I've only just heard it, but it was
from a most reliable source. And now you can ferret it out for yourself; I'll
say nothing more; good-bye."
