He found Kirillov still pacing up and down his room so preoccupied that he had
forgotten the arrival of Shatov's wife, and heard what he said without
understanding him.

"Oh, yes!" he recollected suddenly, as though tearing himself with an effort
and only for an instant from some absorbing idea, "yes... an old woman.... A
wife or an old woman? Stay a minute: a wife and an old woman, is that it? I
remember. I've been, the old woman will come, only not just now. Take the
pillow. Is there anything else? Yes.... Stay, do you have moments of the
eternal harmony, Shatov?"

"You know, Kirillov, you mustn't go on staying up every night."

Kirillov came out of his reverie and, strange to say, spoke far more coherently
than he usually did; it was clear that he had formulated it long ago and
perhaps written it down.

"There are seconds--they come five or six at a time--when you suddenly feel the
presence of the eternal harmony perfectly attained. It's something not
earthly--I don't mean in the sense that it's heavenly--but in that sense that
man cannot endure it in his earthly aspect. He must be physically changed or
die. This feeling is clear and unmistakable; it's as though you apprehend all
nature and suddenly say, 'Yes, that's right.' God, when He created the world,
said at the end of each day of creation, 'Yes, it's right, it's good.' It...
it's not being deeply moved, but simply joy. You don't forgive anything because
there is no more need of forgiveness. It's not that you love--oh, there's
something in it higher than love--what's most awful is that it's terribly clear
and such joy. If it lasted more than five seconds, the soul could not endure it
and must perish. In those five seconds I live through a lifetime, and I'd give
my whole life for them, because they are worth it. To endure ten seconds one
must be physically changed. I think man ought to give up having
children--what's the use of children, what's the use of evolution when the goal
has been attained? In the gospel it is written that there will be no
child-bearing in the resurrection, but that men will be like the angels of the
Lord. That's a hint. Is your wife bearing a child?"

"Kirillov, does this often happen?"

"Once in three days, or once a week."

"Don't you have fits, perhaps?"

"No."

"Well, you will. Be careful, Kirillov. I've heard that's just how fits begin.
An epileptic described exactly that sensation before a fit, word for word as
you've done. He mentioned five seconds, too, and said that more could not be
endured. Remember Mahomet's pitcher from which no drop of water was spilt while
he circled Paradise on his horse. That was a case of five seconds too; that's
too much like your eternal harmony, and Mahomet was an epileptic. Be careful,
Kirillov, it's epilepsy!"

"It won't have time," Kirillov smiled gently.
