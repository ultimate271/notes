On one occasion, just at the time when the first rumours of the emancipation of
the serfs were in the air, when all Russia was exulting and making ready for a
complete regeneration, Varvara Petrovna was visited by a baron from Petersburg,
a man of the highest connections, and very closely associated with the new
reform. Varvara Petrovna prized such visits highly, as her connections in
higher circles had grown weaker and weaker since the death of her husband, and
had at last ceased altogether. The baron spent an hour drinking tea with her.
There was no one else present but Stepan Trofimovitch, whom Varvara Petrovna
invited and exhibited. The baron had heard something about him before or
affected to have done so, but paid little attention to him at tea. Stepan
Trofimovitch of course was incapable of making a social blunder, and his
manners were most elegant. Though I believe he was by no means of exalted
origin, yet it happened that he had from earliest childhood been brought up in
a Moscow household--of high rank, and consequently was well bred. He spoke
French like a Parisian. Thus the baron was to have seen from the first glance
the sort of people with whom Varvara Petrovna surrounded herself, even in
provincial seclusion. But things did not fall out like this. When the baron
positively asserted the absolute truth of the rumours of the great reform,
which were then only just beginning to be heard, Stepan Trofimovitch could not
contain himself, and suddenly shouted "Hurrah!" and even made some
gesticulation indicative of delight. His ejaculation was not over-loud and
quite polite, his delight was even perhaps premeditated, and his gesture
purposely studied before the looking-glass half an hour before tea. But
something must have been amiss with it, for the baron permitted himself a faint
smile, though he, at once, with extraordinary courtesy, put in a phrase
concerning the universal and befitting emotion of all Russian hearts in view of
the great event. Shortly afterwards he took his leave and at parting did not
forget to hold out two fingers to Stepan Trofimovitch. On returning to the
drawing-room Varvara Petrovna was at first silent for two or three minutes, and
seemed to be looking for something on the table. Then she turned to Stepan
Trofimovitch, and with pale face and flashing eyes she hissed in a whisper:

[Speaker]: # {Varvara Petrovna Stavrogin}
"I shall never forgive you for that!"

## Aftermath to a friend
[TreeTag]: # {01.01.04.01.02}
Next day she met her friend as though nothing had happened, she never referred
to the incident, but thirteen years afterwards, at a tragic moment, she
recalled it and reproached him with it, and she turned pale, just as she had
done thirteen years before. Only twice in the course of her life did she say to
him:

[Speaker]: # {Varvara Petrovna Stavrogin}
"I shall never forgive you for that!"

## Anecdote in the garden
[TreeTag]: # {01.01.04.01.03}
[Place]: # {Skvoreshniki}
[Character]: # {Lieutenant-General Stavrogin}
The incident with the baron was the second time, but the first incident was so
characteristic and had so much influence on the fate of Stepan Trofimovitch
that I venture to refer to that too.

It was in 1855, in spring-time, in May, just after the news had reached
Skvoreshniki of the death of Lieutenant-General Stavrogin, a frivolous old
gentleman who died of a stomach ailment on the way to the Crimea, where he was
hastening to join the army on active service. Varvara Petrovna was left a widow
and put on deep mourning. She could not, it is true, deplore his death very
deeply, since, for the last four years, she had been completely separated from
him owing to incompatibility of temper, and was giving him an allowance. (The
Lieutenant-General himself had nothing but one hundred and fifty serfs and his
pay, besides his position and his connections. All the money and Skvoreshniki
belonged to Varvara Petrovna, the only daughter of a very rich contractor.) Yet
she was shocked by the suddenness of the news, and retired into complete
solitude. Stepan Trofimovitch, of course, was always at her side.

May was in its full beauty. The evenings were exquisite. The wild cherry was in
flower. The two friends walked every evening in the garden and used to sit till
nightfall in the arbour, and pour out their thoughts and feelings to one
another. They had poetic moments. Under the influence of the change in her
position Varvara Petrovna talked more than usual. She, as it were, clung to the
heart of her friend, and this continued for several evenings. A strange idea
suddenly came over Stepan Trofimovitch: "Was not the inconsolable widow
reckoning upon him, and expecting from him, when her mourning was over, the
offer of his hand?" A cynical idea, but the very loftiness of a man's nature
sometimes increases a disposition to cynical ideas if only from the
many-sidedness of his culture. He began to look more deeply into it, and
thought it seemed like it. He pondered: "Her fortune is immense, of course,
but..." Varvara Petrovna certainly could not be called a beauty. She was a
tall, yellow, bony woman with an extremely long face, suggestive of a horse.
Stepan Trofimovitch hesitated more and more, he was tortured by doubts, he
positively shed tears of indecision once or twice (he wept not infrequently).
In the evenings, that is to say in the arbour, his countenance involuntarily
began to express something capricious and ironical, something coquettish and at
the same time condescending. This is apt to happen as it were by accident, and
the more gentlemanly the man the more noticeable it is. Goodness only knows
what one is to think about it, but it's most likely that nothing had begun
working in her heart that could have fully justified Stepan Trofimovitch's
suspicions. Moreover, she would not have changed her name, Stavrogin, for his
name, famous as it was. Perhaps there was nothing in it but the play of
femininity on her side; the manifestation of an unconscious feminine yearning
so natural in some extremely feminine types. However, I won't answer for it;
the depths of the female heart have not been explored to this day. But I must
continue.

It is to be supposed that she soon inwardly guessed the significance of her
friend's strange expression; she was quick and observant, and he was sometimes
extremely guileless. But the evenings went on as before, and their
conversations were just as poetic and interesting. And behold on one occasion
at nightfall, after the most lively and poetical conversation, they parted
affectionately, warmly pressing each other's hands at the steps of the lodge
where Stepan Trofimovitch slept. Every summer he used to move into this little
lodge which stood adjoining the huge seignorial house of Skvoreshniki, almost
in the garden. He had only just gone in, and in restless hesitation taken a
cigar, and not having yet lighted it, was standing weary and motionless before
the open window, gazing at the light feathery white clouds gliding around the
bright moon, when suddenly a faint rustle made him start and turn round.
Varvara Petrovna, whom he had left only four minutes earlier, was standing
before him again. Her yellow face was almost blue. Her lips were pressed
tightly together and twitching at the corners. For ten full seconds she looked
him in the eyes in silence with a firm relentless gaze, and suddenly whispered
rapidly:

### Varvara's words to Stepan
[TreeTag]: # {01.01.04.01.03.01}
[Speaker]: # {Varvara Petrovna Stavrogin}
"I shall never forgive you for this!"

## Stepan recalls this incident to the narrator
[TreeTag]: # {01.01.04.01.04}
When, ten years later, Stepan Trofimovitch, after closing the doors, told me
this melancholy tale in a whisper, he vowed that he had been so petrified on
the spot that he had not seen or heard how Varvara Petrovna had disappeared. As
she never once afterwards alluded to the incident and everything went on as
though nothing had happened, he was all his life inclined to the idea that it
was all an hallucination, a symptom of illness, the more so as he was actually
taken ill that very night and was indisposed for a fortnight, which, by the
way, cut short the interviews in the arbour.

But in spite of his vague theory of hallucination he seemed every day, all his
life, to be expecting the continuation, and, so to say, the _d√©nouement_ of
this affair. He could not believe that that was the end of it! And if so he
must have looked strangely sometimes at his friend.
