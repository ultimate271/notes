Our friend certainly had fallen into not a few bad habits, especially of late.
He had obviously and rapidly deteriorated; and it was true that he had become
slovenly. He drank more and had become more tearful and nervous; and had grown
too impressionable on the artistic side. His face had acquired a strange
facility for changing with extraordinary quickness, from the most solemn
expression, for instance, to the most absurd, and even foolish. He could not
endure solitude, and was always craving for amusement. One had always to repeat
to him some gossip, some local anecdote, and every day a new one. If no one
came to see him for a long time he wandered disconsolately about the rooms,
walked to the window, puckering up his lips, heaved deep sighs, and almost fell
to whimpering at last. He was always full of forebodings, was afraid of
something unexpected and inevitable; he had become timorous; he began to pay
great attention to his dreams.

He spent all that day and evening in great depression, he sent for me, was very
much agitated, talked a long while, gave me a long account of things, but all
rather disconnected. Varvara Petrovna had known for a long time that he
concealed nothing from me. It seemed to me at last that he was worried about
something particular, and was perhaps unable to form a definite idea of it
himself. As a rule when we met _tête-à-tête_ and he began making long
complaints to me, a bottle was almost always brought in after a little time,
and things became much more comfortable. This time there was no wine, and he
was evidently struggling all the while against the desire to send for it.

"And why is she always so cross?" he complained every minute, like a child.
_"Tous les hommes de génie et de progrès en Russie étaient, sont, et seront
toujours des_ gamblers _et des_ drunkards _qui boivent_ in outbreaks... and I'm
not such a gambler after all, and I'm not such a drunkard. She reproaches me
for not writing anything. Strange idea!... She asks why I lie down? She says I
ought to stand, 'an example and reproach.' _Mais, entre nous soit dit,_ what is
a man to do who is destined to stand as a 'reproach,' if not to lie down? Does
she understand that?"

And at last it became clear to me what was the chief particular trouble which
was worrying him so persistently at this time. Many times that evening he went
to the looking-glass, and stood a long while before it. At last he turned from
the looking-glass to me, and with a sort of strange despair, said: "_Mon cher,
je suis un_ broken-down man." Yes, certainly, up to that time, up to that very
day there was one thing only of which he had always felt confident in spite of
the "new views," and of the "change in Varvara Petrovna's ideas," that was, the
conviction that still he had a fascination for her feminine heart, not simply
as an exile or a celebrated man of learning, but as a handsome man. For twenty
years this soothing and flattering opinion had been rooted in his mind, and
perhaps of all his convictions this was the hardest to part with. Had he any
presentiment that evening of the colossal ordeal which was preparing for him in
the immediate future?
