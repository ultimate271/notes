## Details of their friendship: letters
[TreeTag]: # {01.01.03.01.01}
There are strange friendships. The two friends are always ready to fly at one
another, and go on like that all their lives, and yet they cannot separate.
Parting, in fact, is utterly impossible. The one who has begun the quarrel and
separated will be the first to fall ill and even die, perhaps, if the
separation comes off. I know for a positive fact that several times Stepan
Trofimovitch has jumped up from the sofa and beaten the wall with his fists
after the most intimate and emotional _tête-à-tête_ with Varvara Petrovna.

This proceeding was by no means an empty symbol; indeed, on one occasion, he
broke some plaster off the wall. It may be asked how I come to know such
delicate details. What if I were myself a witness of it? What if Stepan
Trofimovitch himself has, on more than one occasion, sobbed on my shoulder
while he described to me in lurid colours all his most secret feelings. (And
what was there he did not say at such times!) But what almost always happened
after these tearful outbreaks was that next day he was ready to crucify himself
for his ingratitude. He would send for me in a hurry or run over to see me
simply to assure me that Varvara Petrovna was "an angel of honour and delicacy,
while he was very much the opposite." He did not only run to confide in me,
but, on more than one occasion, described it all to her in the most eloquent
letter, and wrote a full signed confession that no longer ago than the day
before he had told an outsider that she kept him out of vanity, that she was
envious of his talents and erudition, that she hated him and was only afraid to
express her hatred openly, dreading that he would leave her and so damage her
literary reputation, that this drove him to self-contempt, and he was resolved
to die a violent death, and that he was waiting for the final word from her
which would decide everything, and so on and so on in the same style. You can
fancy after this what an hysterical pitch the nervous outbreaks of this most
innocent of all fifty-year-old infants sometimes reached! I once read one of
these letters after some quarrel between them, arising from a trivial matter,
but growing venomous as it went on. I was horrified and besought him not to
send it.

"I must... more honourable... duty... I shall die if I don't confess
everything, everything!" he answered almost in delirium, and he did send the
letter.

That was the difference between them, that Varvara Petrovna never would have
sent such a letter. It is true that he was passionately fond of writing, he
wrote to her though he lived in the same house, and during hysterical
interludes he would write two letters a day. I know for a fact that she always
read these letters with the greatest attention, even when she received two a
day, and after reading them she put them away in a special drawer, sorted and
annotated; moreover, she pondered them in her heart. But she kept her friend
all day without an answer, met him as though there were nothing the matter,
exactly as though nothing special had happened the day before. By degrees she
broke him in so completely that at last he did not himself dare to allude to
what had happened the day before, and only glanced into her eyes at times. But
she never forgot anything, while he sometimes forgot too quickly, and
encouraged by her composure he would not infrequently, if friends came in,
laugh and make jokes over the champagne the very same day. With what malignancy
she must have looked at him at such moments, while he noticed nothing! Perhaps
in a week's time, a month's time, or even six months later, chancing to recall
some phrase in such a letter, and then the whole letter with all its attendant
circumstances, he would suddenly grow hot with shame, and be so upset that he
fell ill with one of his attacks of "summer cholera." These attacks of a sort
of "summer cholera" were, in some cases, the regular consequence of his nervous
agitations and were an interesting peculiarity of his physical constitution.

## Varvara's propensity to think of Stepan as a son
[TreeTag]: # {01.01.03.01.02}
No doubt Varvara Petrovna did very often hate him. But there was one thing he
had not discerned up to the end: that was that he had become for her a son, her
creation, even, one may say, her invention; he had become flesh of her flesh,
and she kept and supported him not simply from "envy of his talents." And how
wounded she must have been by such suppositions! An inexhaustible love for him
lay concealed in her heart in the midst of continual hatred, jealousy, and
contempt. She would not let a speck of dust fall upon him, coddled him up for
twenty-two years, would not have slept for nights together if there were the
faintest breath against his reputation as a poet, a learned man, and a public
character. She had invented him, and had been the first to believe in her own
invention. He was, after a fashion, her day-dream.... But in return she exacted
a great deal from him, sometimes even slavishness. It was incredible how long
she harboured resentment. I have two anecdotes to tell about that.
