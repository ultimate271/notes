Suddenly, apropos of nothing, our prince was guilty of incredible outrages upon
various persons and, what was most striking these outrages were utterly unheard
of, quite inconceivable, unlike anything commonly done, utterly silly and
mischievous, quite unprovoked and objectless. One of the most respected of our
club members, on our committee of management, Pyotr Pavlovitch Gaganov, an
elderly man of high rank in the service, had formed the innocent habit of
declaring vehemently on all sorts of occasions: "No, you can't lead me by the
nose!" Well, there is no harm in that. But one day at the club, when he brought
out this phrase in connection with some heated discussion in the midst of a
little group of members (all persons of some consequence) Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch, who was standing on one side, alone and unnoticed, suddenly
went up to Pyotr Pavlovitch, took him unexpectedly and firmly with two fingers
by the nose, and succeeded in leading him two or three steps across the room.
He could have had no grudge against Mr. Gaganov. It might be thought to be a
mere schoolboy prank, though, of course, a most unpardonable one. Yet,
describing it afterwards, people said that he looked almost dreamy at the very
instant of the operation, "as though he had gone out of his mind," but that was
recalled and reflected upon long afterwards. In the excitement of the moment
all they recalled was the minute after, when he certainly saw it all as it
really was, and far from being confused smiled gaily and maliciously "without
the slightest regret." There was a terrific outcry; he was surrounded. Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch kept turning round, looking about him, answering nobody, and
glancing curiously at the persons exclaiming around him. At last he seemed
suddenly, as it were, to sink into thought again--so at least it was
reported--frowned, went firmly up to the affronted Pyotr Pavlovitch, and with
evident vexation said in a rapid mutter:

### Nikolay carelessly apoligizes for the whole thing
[TreeTag]: # {01.02.02.01.01.01}
[Speaker]: # {Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch Stavrogin}
"You must forgive me, of course... I really don't know what suddenly came over
me... it's silly."

The carelessness of his apology was almost equivalent to a fresh insult. The
outcry was greater than ever. Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch shrugged his shoulders
and went away. All this was very stupid, to say nothing of its gross indecency--

A calculated and premeditated indecency as it seemed at first sight--and
therefore a premeditated and utterly brutal insult to our whole society. So it
was taken to be by every one. We began by promptly and unanimously striking
young Stavrogin's name off the list of club members. Then it was decided to
send an appeal in the name of the whole club to the governor, begging him at
once (without waiting for the case to be formally tried in court) to use "the
administrative power entrusted to him" to restrain this dangerous ruffian,
"this duelling bully from the capital, and so protect the tranquillity of all
the gentry of our town from injurious encroachments." It was added with angry
resentment that "a law might be found to control even Mr. Stavrogin." This
phrase was prepared by way of a thrust at the governor on account of Varvara
Petrovna. They elaborated it with relish. As ill luck would have it, the
governor was not in the town at the time. He had gone to a little distance to
stand godfather to the child of a very charming lady, recently left a widow in
an interesting condition. But it was known that he would soon be back. In the
meanwhile they got up a regular ovation for the respected and insulted
gentleman; people embraced and kissed him; the whole town called upon him. It
was even proposed to give a subscription dinner in his honour, and they only
gave up the idea at his earnest request--reflecting possibly at last that the
man had, after all, been pulled by the nose and that that was really nothing to
congratulate him upon. Yet, how had it happened? How could it have happened? It
is remarkable that no one in the whole town put down this savage act to
madness. They must have been predisposed to expect such actions from Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch, even when he was sane. For my part I don't know to this day
how to explain it, in spite of the event that quickly followed and apparently
explained everything, and conciliated every one. I will add also that, four
years later, in reply to a discreet question from me about the incident at the
club, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch answered, frowning: "I wasn't quite well at the
time." But there is no need to anticipate events.

The general outburst of hatred with which every one fell upon the "ruffian and
duelling bully from the capital" also struck me as curious. They insisted on
seeing an insolent design and deliberate intention to insult our whole society
at once. The truth was no one liked the fellow, but, on the contrary, he had
set every one against him--and one wonders how. Up to the last incident he had
never quarrelled with anyone, nor insulted anyone, but was as courteous as a
gentleman in a fashion-plate, if only the latter were able to speak. I imagine
that he was hated for his pride. Even our ladies, who had begun by adoring him,
railed against him now, more loudly than the men. Varvara Petrovna was
dreadfully overwhelmed. She confessed afterwards to Stepan Trofimovitch that
she had had a foreboding of all this long before, that every day for the last
six months she had been expecting "just something of that sort," a remarkable
admission on the part of his own mother. "It's begun!" she thought to herself
with a shudder. The morning after the incident at the club she cautiously but
firmly approached the subject with her son, but the poor woman was trembling
all over in spite of her firmness. She had not slept all night and even went
out early to Stepan Trofimovitch's lodgings to ask his advice, and shed tears
there, a thing which she had never been known to do before anyone. She longed
for "Nicolas" to say something to her, to deign to give some explanation.
Nikolay, who was always so polite and respectful to his mother, listened to her
for some time scowling, but very seriously. He suddenly got up without saying a
word, kissed her hand and went away. That very evening, as though by design, he
perpetrated another scandal. It was of a more harmless and ordinary character
than the first. Yet, owing to the state of the public mind, it increased the
outcry in the town.

Our friend Liputin turned up and called on Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch immediately
after the latter's interview with his mother, and earnestly begged for the
honour of his company at a little party he was giving for his wife's birthday
that evening. Varvara Petrovna had long watched with a pang at her heart her
son's taste for such low company, but she had not dared to speak of it to him.
He had made several acquaintances besides Liputin in the third rank of our
society, and even in lower depths--he had a propensity for making such friends.
He had never been in Liputin's house before, though he had met the man himself.
He guessed that Liputin's invitation now was the consequence of the previous
day's scandal, and that as a local liberal he was delighted at the scandal,
genuinely believing that that was the proper way to treat stewards at the club,
and that it was very well done. Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch smiled and promised to
come.

A great number of guests had assembled. The company was not very presentable,
but very sprightly. Liputin, vain and envious, only entertained visitors twice
a year, but on those occasions he did it without stint. The most honoured of
the invited guests, Stepan Trofimovitch, was prevented by illness from being
present. Tea was handed, and there were refreshments and vodka in plenty. Cards
were played at three tables, and while waiting for supper the young people got
up a dance. Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch led out Madame Liputin--a very pretty
little woman who was dreadfully shy of him--took two turns round the room with
her, sat down beside her, drew her into conversation and made her laugh.
Noticing at last how pretty she was when she laughed, he suddenly, before all
the company, seized her round the waist and kissed her on the lips two or three
times with great relish. The poor frightened lady fainted. Nikolay
Vsyevolodovitch took his hat and went up to the husband, who stood petrified in
the middle of the general excitement. Looking at him he, too, became confused
and muttering hurriedly "Don't be angry," went away. Liputin ran after him in
the entry, gave him his fur-coat with his own hands, and saw him down the
stairs, bowing. But next day a rather amusing sequel followed this
comparatively harmless prank--a sequel from which Liputin gained some credit,
and of which he took the fullest possible advantage.

At ten o'clock in the morning Liputin's servant Agafya, an easy-mannered,
lively, rosy-cheeked peasant woman of thirty, made her appearance at
Stavrogin's house, with a message for Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch. She insisted on
seeing "his honour himself." He had a very bad headache, but he went out.
Varvara Petrovna succeeded in being present when the message was given.

"Sergay Vassilyevitch" (Liputin's name), Agafya rattled off briskly, "bade me
first of all give you his respectful greetings and ask after your health, what
sort of night your honour spent after yesterday's doings, and how your honour
feels now after yesterday's doings?"

Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch smiled.

"Give him my greetings and thank him, and tell your master from me, Agafya,
that he's the most sensible man in the town."

"And he told me to answer that," Agafya caught him up still more briskly, "that
he knows that without your telling him, and wishes you the same."

"Really! But how could he tell what I should say to you?"

"I can't say in what way he could tell, but when I had set off and had gone
right down the street, I heard something, and there he was, running after me
without his cap. 'I say, Agafya, if by any chance he says to you, "Tell your
master that he has more sense than all the town," you tell him at once, don't
forget, "The master himself knows that very well, and wishes you the same."'"
