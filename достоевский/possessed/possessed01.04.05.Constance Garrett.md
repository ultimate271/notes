Shatov stood at the closed door of his room and listened; suddenly he sprang
back.

"He's coming here, I knew he would," he whispered furiously. "Now there'll be
no getting rid of him till midnight."

Several violent thumps of a fist on the door followed.

"Shatov, Shatov, open!" yelled the captain. "Shatov, friend!

'I have come, to thee to tell thee      That the sun doth r-r-rise apace, That
the forest glows and tr-r-rembles      In... the fire of...his...embrace. Tell
thee I have waked, God damn thee,      Wakened under the birch-twigs....'

("As it might be under the birch-rods, ha ha!")

'Every little bird...is...thirsty,      Says I'm going to...have a drink, But I
don't...know what to drink....'

"Damn his stupid curiosity! Shatov, do you understand how good it is to be
alive!"

"Don't answer!" Shatov whispered to me again.

"Open the door! Do you understand that there's something higher than
brawling... in mankind; there are moments of an hon-hon-honourable man....
Shatov, I'm good; I'll forgive you.... Shatov, damn the manifestoes, eh?"

Silence.

"Do you understand, you ass, that I'm in love, that I've bought a dress-coat,
look, the garb of love, fifteen roubles; a captain's love calls for the
niceties of style.... Open the door!" he roared savagely all of a sudden, and
he began furiously banging with his fists again.

"Go to hell!" Shatov roared suddenly.

"S-s-slave! Bond-slave, and your sister's a slave, a bondswoman... a th...
th... ief!"

"And you sold your sister."

"That's a lie! I put up with the libel though. I could with one word... do you
understand what she is?"

"What?" Shatov at once drew near the door inquisitively.

"But will you understand?"

"Yes, I shall understand, tell me what?"

"I'm not afraid to say! I'm never afraid to say anything in public!..."

"You not afraid? A likely story," said Shatov, taunting him, and nodding to me
to listen.

"Me afraid?"

"Yes, I think you are."

"Me afraid?"

"Well then, tell away if you're not afraid of your master's whip.... You're a
coward, though you are a captain!"

"I... I... she's... she's..." faltered Lebyadkin in a voice shaking with
excitement.

"Well?" Shatov put his ear to the door.

A silence followed, lasting at least half a minute.

"Sc-ou-oundrel!" came from the other side of the door at last, and the captain
hurriedly beat a retreat downstairs, puffing like a samovar, stumbling on every
step.

"Yes, he's a sly one, and won't give himself away even when he's drunk."

Shatov moved away from the door.

"What's it all about?" I asked.

Shatov waved aside the question, opened the door and began listening on the
stairs again. He listened a long while, and even stealthily descended a few
steps. At last he came back.

"There's nothing to be heard; he isn't beating her; he must have flopped down
at once to go to sleep. It's time for you to go."

"Listen, Shatov, what am I to gather from all this?"

"Oh, gather what you like!" he answered in a weary and disgusted voice, and he
sat down to his writing-table.

I went away. An improbable idea was growing stronger and stronger in my mind. I
thought of the next day with distress....
