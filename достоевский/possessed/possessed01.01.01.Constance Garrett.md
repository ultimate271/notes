IN UNDERTAKING to describe the recent and strange incidents in our town, till
lately wrapped in uneventful obscurity, I find myself forced in absence of
literary skill to begin my story rather far back, that is to say, with certain
biographical details concerning that talented and highly-esteemed gentleman,
Stepan Trofimovitch Verhovensky. I trust that these details may at least serve
as an introduction, while my projected story itself will come later.

## Stepan's role as a persecured patriot
[TreeTag]: # {01.01.01.01.02}
[Character]: # {Stepan Trofimovitch Verhovensky}
[Myth]: # {Gulliver}
I will say at once that Stepan Trofimovitch had always filled a particular r√¥le
among us, that of the progressive patriot, so to say, and he was passionately
fond of playing the part--so much so that I really believe he could not have
existed without it. Not that I would put him on a level with an actor at a
theatre, God forbid, for I really have a respect for him. This may all have
been the effect of habit, or rather, more exactly of a generous propensity he
had from his earliest years for indulging in an agreeable day-dream in which he
figured as a picturesque public character. He fondly loved, for instance, his
position as a "persecuted" man and, so to speak, an "exile." There is a sort of
traditional glamour about those two little words that fascinated him once for
all and, exalting him gradually in his own opinion, raised him in the course of
years to a lofty pedestal very gratifying to vanity. In an English satire of
the last century, Gulliver, returning from the land of the Lilliputians where
the people were only three or four inches high, had grown so accustomed to
consider himself a giant among them, that as he walked along the streets of
London he could not help crying out to carriages and passers-by to be careful
and get out of his way for fear he should crush them, imagining that they were
little and he was still a giant. He was laughed at and abused for it, and rough
coachmen even lashed at the giant with their whips. But was that just? What may
not be done by habit? Habit had brought Stepan Trofimovitch almost to the same
position, but in a more innocent and inoffensive form, if one may use such
expressions, for he was a most excellent man.

I am even inclined to suppose that towards the end he had been entirely
forgotten everywhere; but still it cannot be said that his name had never been
known. It is beyond question that he had at one time belonged to a certain
distinguished constellation of celebrated leaders of the last generation, and
at one time--though only for the briefest moment--his name was pronounced by
many hasty persons of that day almost as though it were on a level with the
names of Tchaadaev, of Byelinsky, of Granovsky, and of Herzen, who had only
just begun to write abroad. But Stepan Trofimovitch's activity ceased almost at
the moment it began, owing, so to say, to a "vortex of combined circumstances."
And would you believe it? It turned out afterwards that there had been no
"vortex" and even no "circumstances," at least in that connection. I only
learned the other day to my intense amazement, though on the most unimpeachable
authority, that Stepan Trofimovitch had lived among us in our province not as
an "exile" as we were accustomed to believe, and had never even been under
police supervision at all. Such is the force of imagination! All his life he
sincerely believed that in certain spheres he was a constant cause of
apprehension, that every step he took was watched and noted, and that each one
of the three governors who succeeded one another during twenty years in our
province came with special and uneasy ideas concerning him, which had, by
higher powers, been impressed upon each before everything else, on receiving
the appointment. Had anyone assured the honest man on the most irrefutable
grounds that he had nothing to be afraid of, he would certainly have been
offended. Yet Stepan Trofimovitch was a most intelligent and gifted man, even,
so to say, a man of science, though indeed, in science... well, in fact he had
not done such great things in science. I believe indeed he had done nothing at
all. But that's very often the case, of course, with men of science among us in
Russia.

He came back from abroad and was brilliant in the capacity of lecturer at the
university, towards the end of the forties. He only had time to deliver a few
lectures, I believe they were about the Arabs; he maintained, too, a brilliant
thesis on the political and Hanseatic importance of the German town Hanau, of
which there was promise in the epoch between 1413 and 1428, and on the special
and obscure reasons why that promise was never fulfilled. This dissertation was
a cruel and skilful thrust at the Slavophils of the day, and at once made him
numerous and irreconcilable enemies among them. Later on--after he had lost his
post as lecturer, however--he published (by way of revenge, so to say, and to
show them what a man they had lost) in a progressive monthly review, which
translated Dickens and advocated the views of George Sand, the beginning of a
very profound investigation into the causes, I believe, of the extraordinary
moral nobility of certain knights at a certain epoch or something of that
nature.

Some lofty and exceptionally noble idea was maintained in it, anyway. It was
said afterwards that the continuation was hurriedly forbidden and even that the
progressive review had to suffer for having printed the first part. That may
very well have been so, for what was not possible in those days? Though, in
this case, it is more likely that there was nothing of the kind, and that the
author himself was too lazy to conclude his essay. He cut short his lectures on
the Arabs because, somehow and by someone (probably one of his reactionary
enemies) a letter had been seized giving an account of certain circumstances,
in consequence of which someone had demanded an explanation from him. I don't
know whether the story is true, but it was asserted that at the same time there
was discovered in Petersburg a vast, unnatural, and illegal conspiracy of
thirty people which almost shook society to its foundations. It was said that
they were positively on the point of translating Fourier. As though of design a
poem of Stepan Trofimovitch's was seized in Moscow at that very time, though it
had been written six years before in Berlin in his earliest youth, and
manuscript copies had been passed round a circle consisting of two poetical
amateurs and one student. This poem is lying now on my table. No longer ago
than last year I received a recent copy in his own handwriting from Stepan
Trofimovitch himself, signed by him, and bound in a splendid red leather
binding. It is not without poetic merit, however, and even a certain talent.
It's strange, but in those days (or to be more exact, in the thirties) people
were constantly composing in that style. I find it difficult to describe the
subject, for I really do not understand it. It is some sort of an allegory in
lyrical-dramatic form, recalling the second part of Faust. The scene opens with
a chorus of women, followed by a chorus of men, then a chorus of incorporeal
powers of some sort, and at the end of all a chorus of spirits not yet living
but very eager to come to life. All these choruses sing about something very
indefinite, for the most part about somebody's curse, but with a tinge of the
higher humour. But the scene is suddenly changed. There begins a sort of
"festival of life" at which even insects sing, a tortoise comes on the scene
with certain sacramental Latin words, and even, if I remember aright, a mineral
sings about something that is a quite inanimate object. In fact, they all sing
continually, or if they converse, it is simply to abuse one another vaguely,
but again with a tinge of higher meaning. At last the scene is changed again; a
wilderness appears, and among the rocks there wanders a civilized young man who
picks and sucks certain herbs. Asked by a fairy why he sucks these herbs, he
answers that, conscious of a superfluity of life in himself, he seeks
forgetfulness, and finds it in the juice of these herbs, but that his great
desire is to lose his reason at once (a desire possibly superfluous). Then a
youth of indescribable beauty rides in on a black steed, and an immense
multitude of all nations follow him. The youth represents death, for whom all
the peoples are yearning. And finally, in the last scene we are suddenly shown
the Tower of Babel, and certain athletes at last finish building it with a song
of new hope, and when at length they complete the topmost pinnacle, the lord
(of Olympia, let us say) takes flight in a comic fashion, and man, grasping the
situation and seizing his place, at once begins a new life with new insight
into things. Well, this poem was thought at that time to be dangerous. Last
year I proposed to Stepan Trofimovitch to publish it, on the ground of its
perfect harmlessness nowadays, but he declined the suggestion with evident
dissatisfaction. My view of its complete harmlessness evidently displeased him,
and I even ascribe to it a certain coldness on his part, which lasted two whole
months.

And what do you think? Suddenly, almost at the time I proposed printing it
here, our poem was published abroad in a collection of revolutionary verse,
without the knowledge of Stepan Trofimovitch. He was at first alarmed, rushed
to the governor, and wrote a noble letter in self-defence to Petersburg. He
read it to me twice, but did not send it, not knowing to whom to address it. In
fact he was in a state of agitation for a whole month, but I am convinced that
in the secret recesses of his heart he was enormously flattered. He almost took
the copy of the collection to bed with him, and kept it hidden under his
mattress in the daytime; he positively would not allow the women to turn his
bed, and although he expected every day a telegram, he held his head high. No
telegram came. Then he made friends with me again, which is a proof of the
extreme kindness of his gentle and unresentful heart.
