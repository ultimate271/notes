CHAPTER V. THE SUBTLE SERPENT

# II
There could be nothing surprising to Praskovya Ivanovna in such a reception.
Varvara Petrovna had from childhood upwards treated her old school friend
tyrannically, and under a show of friendship almost contemptuously. And this
was an exceptional occasion too. During the last few days there had almost been
a complete rupture between the two households, as I have mentioned incidentally
already. The reason of this rupture was still a mystery to Varvara Petrovna,
which made it all the more offensive; but the chief cause of offence was that
Praskovya Ivanovna had succeeded in taking up an extraordinarily supercilious
attitude towards Varvara Petrovna. Varvara Petrovna was wounded of course, and
meanwhile some strange rumours had reached her which also irritated her
extremely, especially by their vagueness. Varvara Petrovna was of a direct and
proudly frank character, somewhat slap-dash in her methods, indeed, if the
expression is permissible. There was nothing she detested so much as secret and
mysterious insinuations, she always preferred war in the open. Anyway, the two
ladies had not met for five days. The last visit had been paid by Varvara
Petrovna, who had come back from "that Drozdov woman" offended and perplexed. I
can say with certainty that Praskovya Ivanovna had come on this occasion with
the na√Øve conviction that Varvara Petrovna would, for some reason, be sure to
stand in awe of her. This was evident from the very expression of her face.
Evidently too, Varvara Petrovna was always possessed by a demon of haughty
pride whenever she had the least ground for suspecting that she was for some
reason supposed to be humiliated. Like many weak people, who for a long time
allow themselves to be insulted without resenting it, Praskovya Ivanovna showed
an extraordinary violence in her attack at the first favourable opportunity. It
is true that she was not well, and always became more irritable in illness. I
must add finally, that our presence in the drawing-room could hardly be much
check to the two ladies who had been friends from childhood, if a quarrel had
broken out between them. We were looked upon as friends of the family, and
almost as their subjects. I made that reflection with some alarm at the time.
Stepan Trofimovitch, who had not sat down since the entrance of Varvara
Petrovna, sank helplessly into an arm-chair on hearing Praskovya Ivanovna's
squeal, and tried to catch my eye with a look of despair. Shatov turned sharply
in his chair, and growled something to himself. I believe he meant to get up
and go away. Liza rose from her chair but sank back again at once without even
paying befitting attention to her mother's squeal--not from "waywardness," but
obviously because she was entirely absorbed by some other overwhelming
impression. She was looking absent-mindedly into the air, no longer noticing
even Marya Timofyevna.
