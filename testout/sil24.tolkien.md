# The voyage of Eärendil upon Vingilot
[TreeTag]: # {24.01}
## Eärendil, weds Elwing, but is still thirsty for the west
[TreeTag]: # {24.01.01}
Bright Eärendil was then lord of the people that dwelt nigh to Sirion's mouths;
and he took to wife Elwing the fair, and she bore to him Elrond and Elros, who
are called the Half-elven. Yet Eärendil could not rest, and his voyages about
the shores of the Hither Lands eased not his unquiet. Two purposes grew in his
heart, blended as one in longing for the wide Sea: he sought to sail thereon,
seeking after Tuor and Idril who returned not; and he thought to find perhaps
the last shore, and bring ere he died the message of Elves and Men to the Valar
in the West, that should move their hearts to pity for the sorrows of
Middle-earth.

## With the help of Círdan, Eärendil builds Vingilot and sets out on a journey while Elwing waits at the mouths of Sirion
[TreeTag]: # {24.01.02}
Now Eärendil became fast in friendship with Círdan the Shipwright, who dwelt on
the Isle of Balar with those of his people who escaped from the sack of the
Havens of Brithombar and Eglarest. With the aid of Círdan Eärendil built
Vingilot, the Foam-flower, fairest of the ships of song; golden were its oars
and white its timbers, hewn in the birchwoods of Nimbrethil, and its sails were
as the argent moon. In the Lay of Eärendil is many a thing sung of his
adventures in the deep and in lands untrodden, and in many seas and in many
isles; but Elwing was not with him, and she sat in sorrow by the mouths of
Sirion.

## Eärendil finds not his parents nor Valinor, but at a shadow flys back to the mouths of Sirion
[TreeTag]: # {24.01.03}
Eärendil found not Tuor nor Idril, nor came he ever on that journey to the
shores of Valinor, defeated by shadows and enchantment, driven by repelling
winds, until in longing for Elwing he turned homeward towards the coast of
Beleriand. And his heart bade him haste, for a sudden fear had fallen on him
out of dreams; and the winds that before he had striven with might not now bear
him back as swift as his desire.

# The third kin-slaying of Elves to Elves
[TreeTag]: # {24.02}
## Maedhros stays his hand for a bit, but the oath brings about the third kinslaying of elves
[TreeTag]: # {24.02.01}
Now when first the tidings came to Maedhros that Elwing yet lived, and dwelt in
possession of the Silmaril by the mouths of Sirion, he repenting of the deeds
in Doriath withheld his hand. But in time the knowledge of their oath
unfulfilled returned to torment him and his brothers, and gathering from their
wandering hunting-paths they sent messages to the Havens of friendship and yet
of stern demand. Then Elwing and the people of Sirion would not yield the jewel
which Beren had won and Lúthien had worn, and for which Dior the fair was
slain; and least of all while Eärendil their lord was on the sea, for it seemed
to them that in the Silmaril lay the healing and the blessing that had come
upon their houses and their ships. And so there came to pass the last and
cruellest of the slayings of Elf by Elf; and that was the third of the great
wrongs achieved by the accursed oath.

# How Elwing comes to Eärendil, and their voyage to Valinor
[TreeTag]: # {24.03}
## Elwing casts herself into the sea, while Círdan and Gil-galad come help those that were not slain to flee to Balar
[TreeTag]: # {24.03.01}
For the sons of Fëanor that yet lived came down suddenly upon the exiles of
Gondolin and the remnant of Doriath, and destroyed them. In that battle some of
their people stood aside, and some few rebelled and were slain upon the other
part aiding Elwing against their own lords (for such was the sorrow and
confusion in the hearts of the Eldar in those days); but Maedhros and Maglor
won the day, though they alone remained thereafter of the sons of Fëanor, for
both Amrod and Amras were slain. Too late the ships of Círdan and Gil-galad the
High King came hasting to the aid of the Elves of Sirion; and Elwing was gone,
and her sons. Then such few of that people as did not perish in the assault
joined themselves to Gil-galad, and went with him to Balar; and they told that
Elros and Elrond were taken captive, but Elwing with the Silmaril upon her
breast had cast herself into the sea.

## Ulmo saves Elwing and the Silmaril, and she comes upon Eärendil on his return journey
[TreeTag]: # {24.03.02}
Thus Maedhros and Maglor gained not the jewel; but it was not lost. For Ulmo
bore up Elwing out of the waves, and he gave her the likeness of a great white
bird, and upon her breast there shone as a star the Silmaril, as she flew over
the water to seek Eärendil her beloved. On a time of night Eärendil at the helm
of his ship saw her come towards him, as a white cloud exceeding swift beneath
the moon, as a star over the sea moving in strange course, a pale flame on
wings of storm. And it is sung that she fell from the air upon the timbers of
Vingilot, in a swoon, nigh unto death for the urgency of her speed, and
Eärendil took her to his bosom; but in the morning with marvelling eyes he
beheld his wife in her own form beside him with her hair upon his face, and she
slept.

## Eärendil and Elwing fear for the lives of their captive sons, but Maglor has pity on them
[TreeTag]: # {24.03.03}
Great was the sorrow of Eärendil and Elwing for the ruin of the havens of
Sirion, and the captivity of their sons, and they feared that they would be
slain; but it was not so. For Maglor took pity upon Elros and Elrond, and he
cherished them, and love grew after between them, as little might be thought;
but Maglor's heart was sick and weary with the burden of the dreadful oath.

## Eärendil turns again towards Valinor, and with the power of the Silmaril they come to it
[TreeTag]: # {24.03.04}
Yet Eärendil saw now no hope left in the lands of Middle-earth, and he turned
again in despair and came not home, but sought back once more to Valinor with
Elwing at his side. He stood now most often at the prow of Vingilot, and the
Silmaril was bound upon his brow; and ever its light grew greater as they drew
into the West. And the wise have said that it was by reason of the power of
that holy jewel that they came in time to waters that no vessels save those of
the Teleri had known; and they came to the Enchanted Isles and escaped their
enchantment; and they came into the Shadowy Seas and passed their shadows, and
they looked upon Tol Eressëa the Lonely Isle, but tarried not; and at the last
they cast anchor in the Bay of Eldamar, and the Teleri saw the coming of that
ship out of the East and they were amazed, gazing from afar upon the light of
the Silmaril, and it was very great. Then Eärendil, first of living Men, landed
on the immortal shores; and he spoke there to Elwing and to those that were
with him, and they were three mariners who had sailed all the seas besides him:
Falathar, Erellont, and Aerandir were their names. And Eärendil said to them:
'Here none but myself shall set foot, lest you fall under the wrath of the
Valar. But that peril I will take on myself alone, for the sake of the Two
Kindreds.'

## Elwing decides to step also on the lands of Aman with Eärendil
[TreeTag]: # {24.03.05}
But Elwing answered: 'Then would our paths be sundered for ever; but all thy
perils I will take on myself also.' And she leaped into the white foam and ran
towards him; but Eärendil was sorrowful, for he feared the anger of the Lords
of the West upon any of Middle-earth that should dare to pass the leaguer of
Aman.  And there they bade farewell to the companions of their voyage, and were
taken from them for ever.

# Eärendil presents his case to the Valar, and the fate of the Halfelven
[TreeTag]: # {24.04}
## Eärendil alone comes to Calacirya, but it is empty as the Valar and Eldar are having a feast at Taniquetil
[TreeTag]: # {24.04.01}
Then Eärendil said to Elwing: 'Await me here; for one only may bring the
message that it is my fate to bear.' And he went up alone into the land, and
came into the Calacirya, and it seemed to him empty and silent; for even as
Morgoth and Ungoliant came in ages past, so now Eärendil had come at a time of
festival, and wellnigh all the Elvenfolk were gone to Valimar, or were gathered
in the halls of Manwë upon Taniquetil, and few were left to keep watch upon the
walls of Tirion.

## Eärendil wanders alone about Túna and Tirion, and he is about to walk away when he hears a voice
[TreeTag]: # {24.04.02}
But some there were who saw him from afar, and the great light that he bore;
and they went in haste to Valimar. But Eärendil climbed the green hill of Túna
and found it bare; and he entered into the streets of Tirion, and they were
empty; and his heart was heavy, for he feared that some evil had come even to
the Blessed Realm. He walked in the deserted ways of Tirion, and the dust upon
his raiment and his shoes was a dust of diamonds, and he shone and glistened as
he climbed the long white stairs. And he called aloud in many tongues, both of
Elves and Men, but there were none to answer him. Therefore he turned back at
last towards the sea; but even as he took the shoreward road one stood upon the
hill and called to him in a great voice, crying:

## Eärendil is hailed
[TreeTag]: # {24.04.03}
'Hail Eärendil, of mariners most renowned, the looked for that cometh at
unawares, the longed for that cometh beyond hope! Hail Eärendil, bearer of
light before the Sun and Moon! Splendour of the Children of Earth, star in the
darkness, jewel in the sunset, radiant in the morning!'

## Eärendil presents his message of the kindred of middle earth
[TreeTag]: # {24.04.04}
That voice was the voice of Eönwë, herald of Manwë, and he came from Valimar,
and summoned Eärendil to come before the Powers of Arda. And Eärendil went into
Valinor and to the halls of Valimar, and never again set foot upon the lands of
Men. Then the Valar took counsel together, and they summoned Ulmo from the
deeps of the sea; and Eärendil stood before their faces, and delivered the
errand of the Two Kindreds.  Pardon he asked for the Noldor and pity for their
great sorrows, and mercy upon Men and Elves and succour in their need. And his
prayer was granted.

## Mandos and Ulmo discuss the fate of Eärendil as one of the exiled that stepped into the holy land
[TreeTag]: # {24.04.05}
It is told among the Elves that after Eärendil had departed, seeking Elwing his
wife, Mandos spoke concerning his fate; and he said: 'Shall mortal Man step
living upon the undying lands, and yet live?' But Ulmo said: 'For this he was
born into the world. And say unto me: whether is he Eärendil Tuor's son of the
line of Hador, or the son of Idril, Turgon's daughter, of the Elven-house of
Finwë?' And Mandos answered: 'Equally the Noldor, who went wilfully into exile,
may not return hither.'

## Manwë gives judgement not to Eärendil nor Elwing, but decrees that they shall not leave Valinor, but they are given a choice of fate
[TreeTag]: # {24.04.06}
But when all was spoken, Manwë gave judgement, and he said: 'In this matter the
power of doom is given to me. The peril that he ventured for love of the Two
Kindreds shall not fall upon Eärendil, nor shall it fall upon Elwing his wife,
who entered into peril for love of him; but they shall not walk again ever
among Elves or Men in the Outer Lands.  And this is my decree concerning them:
to Eärendil and to Elwing, and to their sons, shall be given leave each to
choose freely to which kindred their fates shall be joined, and under which
kindred they shall be judged.'

## Eärendil returns to Elwing to find her discussing with the Eldar at the Haven of the Swans of the doings in Middle Earth
[TreeTag]: # {24.04.07}
Now when Eärendil was long time gone Elwing became lonely and afraid; and
wandering by the margin of the sea she came near to Alqualondë, where lay the
Telerin fleets. There the Teleri befriended her, and they listened to her tales
of Doriath and Gondolin and the griefs of Beleriand, and they were filled with
pity and wonder; and there Eärendil returning found her, at the Haven of the
Swans. But ere long they were summoned to Valimar; and there the decree of the
Elder King was declared to them.

## Elwing choose the fate of the elves, and for her sake Eärendil chose also
[TreeTag]: # {24.04.08}
Then Eärendil said to Elwing: 'Choose thou, for now I am weary of the world.'
And Elwing chose to be judged among the Firstborn Children of Ilúvatar, because
of Lúthien; and for her sake Eärendil chose alike, though his heart was rather
with the kindred of Men and the people of his father. Then at the bidding of
the Valar Eönwë went to the shore of Aman, where the companions of Eärendil
still remained, awaiting tidings; and he took a boat, and the three mariners
were set therein, and the Valar drove them away into the East with a great
wind. But they took Vingilot, and hallowed it, and bore it away through Valinor
to the uttermost rim of the world; and there it passed through the Door of
Night and was lifted up even into the oceans of heaven.

# Of the Journies of Eärendil with the Silmaril, and of Elwing awaiting on the return
[TreeTag]: # {24.05}
## The Vingilat is hallowed and brought through Valinor, and Eärendil journies with the Silmaril into the starless voids
[TreeTag]: # {24.05.01}
Now fair and marvellous was that vessel made, and it was filled with a wavering
flame, pure and bright; and Eärendil the Mariner sat at the helm, glistening
with dust of elven-gems, and the Silmaril was bound upon his brow. Far he
journeyed in that ship, even into the starless voids; but most often was he
seen at morning or at evening, glimmering in sunrise or sunset, as he came back
to Valinor from voyages beyond the confines of the world.

## Elwing does not journey with Eärendil, but instead comes to him at his returns as a swan
[TreeTag]: # {24.05.02}
On those journeys Elwing did not go, for she might not endure the cold and the
pathless voids, and she loved rather the earth and the sweet winds that blow on
sea and hill. Therefore there was built for her a white tower northward upon
the borders of the Sundering Seas; and thither at times all the sea-birds of
the earth repaired. And it is said that Elwing learned the tongues of birds,
who herself had once worn their shape; and they taught her the craft of flight,
and her wings were of white and silver-grey. And at times, when Eärendil
returning drew near again to Arda, she would fly to meet him, even as she had
flown long ago, when she was rescued from the sea. Then the far-sighted among
the Elves that dwelt in the Lonely Isle would see her like a white bird,
shining, rose-stained in the sunset, as she soared in joy to greet the coming
of Vingilot to haven.

## The people of Middle Earth see Vingilot and call it Gil-Estel
[TreeTag]: # {24.05.03}
Now when first Vingilot was set to sail in the seas of heaven, it rose unlocked
for, glittering and bright; and the people of Middle-earth beheld it from afar
and wondered, and they took it for a sign, and called it Gil-Estel, the Star of
High Hope. And when this new star was seen at evening, Maedhros spoke to Maglor
his brother, and he said: 'Surely that is a Silmaril that shines now in the
West?'

## Maglor replies that if indeed that is the Silmaril, that they should be glad
[TreeTag]: # {24.05.04}
And Maglor answered: 'If it be truly the Silmaril which we saw cast into the
sea that rises again by the power of the Valar, then let us be glad; for its
glory is seen now by many, and is yet secure from all evil.' Then the Elves
looked up, and despaired no longer; but Morgoth was filled with doubt.

# The War of Wrath
[TreeTag]: # {24.06}
## The host of the Valar with Ingwë and Finarfin and Elwing come upon Morgoth who was not expecting a force from the West
[TreeTag]: # {24.06.01}
Yet it is said that Morgoth looked not for the assault that came upon him from
the West; for so great was his pride become that he deemed that none would ever
again come with open war against him. Moreover he thought that he had for ever
estranged the Noldor from the Lords of the West, and that content in their
blissful realm the Valar would heed no more his kingdom in the world without;
for to him that is pitiless the deeds of pity are ever strange and beyond
reckoning. But the host of the Valar prepared for battle; and beneath their
white banners marched the Vanyar, the people of Ingwë, and those also of the
Noldor who never departed from Valinor, whose leader was Finarfin the son of
Finwë. Few of the Teleri were willing to go forth to war, for they remembered
the slaying at the Swan-haven, and the rape of their ships; but they hearkened
to Elwing, who was the daughter of Dior Eluchíl and come of their own kindred,
and they sent mariners enough to sail the ships that bore the host of Valinor
east over the sea. Yet they stayed aboard their vessels, and none of them set
foot upon the Hither Lands.

## Of the magnificence of that host of Valar
[TreeTag]: # {24.06.02}
Of the march of the host of the Valar to the north of Middle-earth little is
said in any tale; for among them went none of those Elves who had dwelt and
suffered in the Hither Lands, and who made the histories of those days that
still are known; and tidings of these things they only learned long afterwards
from their kinsfolk in Aman. But at the last the might of Valinor came up out
of the West, and the challenge of the trumpets of Eönwë filled the sky; and
Beleriand was ablaze with the glory of their arms, for the host of the Valar
were arrayed in forms young and fair and terrible, and the mountains rang
beneath their feet.

## Of the Great Battle, the War of Wrath
[TreeTag]: # {24.06.03}
The meeting of the hosts of the West and of the North is named the Great
Battle, and the War of Wrath. There was marshalled the whole power of the
Throne of Morgoth, and it had become great beyond count, so that Anfauglith
could not contain it; and all the North was aflame with war.

## Morgoths host is utterly destroyed, and the men that remained took arms with the Valar
[TreeTag]: # {24.06.04}
But it availed him not. The Balrogs were destroyed, save some few that fled and
hid themselves in caverns inaccessible at the roots of the earth; and the
uncounted legions of the Orcs perished like straw in a great fire, or were
swept like shrivelled leaves before a burning wind.  Few remained to trouble
the world for long years after. And such few as were left of the three houses
of the Elf-friends, Fathers of Men, fought upon the part of the Valar; and they
were avenged in those days for Baragund and Barahir, Galdor and Gundor, Huor
and Húrin, and many others of their lords. But a great part of the sons of Men,
whether of the people of Uldor or others new-come out of the east, marched with
the Enemy; and the Elves do not forget it.

## Morgoth, being cornered and without other option, unleashes his winged dragons
[TreeTag]: # {24.06.05}
Then, seeing that his hosts were overthrown and his power dispersed, Morgoth
quailed, and he dared not to come forth himself. But he loosed upon his foes
the last desperate assault that he had prepared, and out of the pits of Angband
there issued the winged dragons, that had not before been seen; and so sudden
and ruinous was the onset of that dreadful fleet that the host of the Valar was
driven back, for the coming of the dragons was with great thunder, and
lightning, and a tempest of fire.

## Eärendil, with Thorondor the Eagle, come and defeat the Dragons, and Morgoth is rebound and the Silmirils stripped from his crown
[TreeTag]: # {24.06.06}
But Eärendil came, shining with white flame, and about Vingilot were gathered
all the great birds of heaven and Thorondor was their captain, and there was
battle in the air all the day and through a dark night of doubt. Before the
rising of the sun Eärendil slew Ancalagon the Black, the mightiest of the
dragon-host, and cast him from the sky; and he fell upon the towers of
Thangorodrim, and they were broken in his ruin.  Then the sun rose, and the
host of the Valar prevailed, and well-nigh all the dragons were destroyed; and
all the pits of Morgoth were broken and unroofed, and the might of the Valar
descended into the deeps of the earth. There Morgoth stood at last at bay, and
yet unvaliant. He fled into the deepest of his mines, and sued for peace and
pardon; but his feet were hewn from under him, and he was hurled upon his face.
Then he was bound with the chain Angainor which he had worn aforetime, and his
iron crown they beat into a collar for his neck, and his head was bowed upon
his knees. And the two Silmarils which remained to Morgoth were taken from his
crown, and they shone unsullied beneath the sky; and Eönwë took them, and
guarded them.

## Of the end, how the slaves of Morgoth are freed and the seas roared down
[TreeTag]: # {24.06.07}
Thus an end was made of the power of Angband in the North, and' the evil realm
was brought to naught; and out of the deep prisons a multitude of slaves came
forth beyond all hope into the light of day, and they looked upon a world that
was changed. For so great was the fury of those adversaries that the northern
regions of the western world were rent asunder, and the sea roared in through
many chasms, and there was confusion and great noise; and rivers perished or
found new paths, and the valleys were upheaved and the hills trod down; and
Sirion was no more.

# Of Maedhros and Maglor and the last fate of the Silmarils
[TreeTag]: # {24.07}
## Eönwë summons the Elves of Beleriand to depart from Middle-earth, but Maedhros and Maglor stick to their oath even against the Valar
[TreeTag]: # {24.07.01}
Then Eönwë as herald of the Elder King summoned the Elves of Beleriand to
depart from Middle-earth. But Maedhros and Maglor would not hearken, and they
prepared, though now with weariness and loathing, to attempt in despair the
fulfilment of their oath; for they would have given battle for the Silmarils,
were they withheld, even against the victorious host of Valinor, even though
they stood alone against all the world. And they sent a message therefore to
Eönwë, bidding him yield up now those jewels which of old Fëanor their father
made and Morgoth stole from him.

## Maglor begins to submit to the logic of Eönwë
[TreeTag]: # {24.07.02}
But Eönwë answered that the right to the work of their father, which the sons
of Fëanor formerly possessed, had now perished, because of their many and
merciless deeds, being blinded by their oath, and most of all because of their
slaying of Dior and the assault upon the Havens. The light of the Silmarils
should go now into the West, whence it came in the beginning; and to Valinor
must Maedhros and Maglor return, and there abide the judgement of the Valar, by
whose decree alone would Eönwë yield the jewels from his charge. Then Maglor
desired indeed to submit, for his heart was sorrowful, and he said: The oath
says not that we may not bide our time, and it may be that in Valinor all shall
be forgiven and forgot, and we shall come into our own in peace.

## Maedhros disagrees, sticking to his oath
[TreeTag]: # {24.07.03}
But Maedhros answered that if they returned to Aman but the favour of the Valar
were withheld from them, then their oath would still remain, but its fulfilment
be beyond all hope; and he said: 'Who can tell to what dreadful doom we shall
come, if we disobey the Powers in their own land, or purpose ever to bring war
again into their holy realm?'

## Maglor tries to reason with Maedhros
[TreeTag]: # {24.07.04}
Yet Maglor still held back, saying: 'If Manwë and Varda themselves deny the
fulfilment of an oath to which we named them in witness, is it not made void?'

## Maedhros appeals to the oath given to Ilúvatar
[TreeTag]: # {24.07.05}
And Maedhros answered: 'But how shall our voices reach to Ilúvatar beyond the
Circles of the World? And by Ilúvatar we swore in our madness, and called the
Everlasting Darkness upon us, if we kept not our word. Who shall release us?'

## Maglor says both ways seem bad, but breaking less bad
[TreeTag]: # {24.07.06}
'If none can release us,' said Maglor, 'then indeed the Everlasting Darkness
shall be our lot, whether we keep our oath or break it; but less evil shall we
do in the breaking.'

## But Maglor is bent to the will of Maedhros, and they steal the Silmarils, and the Valar let them go
[TreeTag]: # {24.07.07}
Yet he yielded at last to the will of Maedhros, and they took counsel together
how they should lay hands on the Silmarils. And they disguised themselves, and
came in the night to the camp of Eönwë, and crept into the place where the
Silmarils were guarded; and they slew the guards, and laid hands on the jewels.
Then all the camp was raised against them, and they prepared to die, defending
themselves until the last.  But Eönwë would not permit the slaying of the sons
of Fëanor; and departing unfought they fled far away. Each of them took to
himself a Silmaril, for they said: 'Since one is lost to us, and but two
remain, and we two alone of our brothers, so is it plain that fate would have
us share the heirlooms of our father.'

## The Silmaril of Maedhros burns him, and in his pain he casts himself into the fires of the earth
[TreeTag]: # {24.07.08}
But the jewel burned the hand of Maedhros in pain unbearable; and he perceived
that it was as Eönwë had said, and that his right thereto had become void, and
that the oath was vain. And being in anguish and despair he cast himself into a
gaping chasm filled with fire, and so ended; and the Silmaril that he bore was
taken into the bosom of the Earth,

## And the torment of Maglor caused him to throw his Silmaril into the sea
[TreeTag]: # {24.07.09}
And it is told of Maglor that he could not endure the pain with which the
Silmaril tormented him; and he cast it at last into the Sea, and thereafter he
wandered ever upon the shores, singing in pain and regret beside the waves. For
Maglor was mighty among the singers of old, named only after Daeron of Doriath;
but he came never back among the people of the Elves. And thus it came to pass
that the Silmarils found their long homes: one in the airs of heaven, and one
in the fires of the heart of the world, and one in the deep waters.

# Conclusion of all in the first age
[TreeTag]: # {24.08}
## Many Eldar set sail to the West, but without the Silmarils
[TreeTag]: # {24.08.01}
In those days there was a great building of ships upon the shores of the
Western Sea; and thence in many a fleet the Eldar set sail into the West, and
came never back to the lands of weeping and of war. And the Vanyar returned
beneath their white banners, and were borne in triumph to Valinor; but their
joy in victory was diminished, for they returned without the Silmarils from
Morgoth's crown, and they knew that those jewels could not be found or brought
together again unless the world be broken and remade.

## The Elves of Beleriand dwell on Tol Eressëa
[TreeTag]: # {24.08.02}
And when they came into the West the Elves of Beleriand dwelt upon Tol Eressëa,
the Lonely Isle, that looks both west and east; whence they might come even to
Valinor. They were admitted again to the love of Manwë and the pardon of the
Valar; and the Teleri forgave their ancient grief, and the curse was laid to
rest.

## Of the Eldalië that stayed, Círdan, Galadriel, Celeborn, and Gil-galad with Elrond, and Elros who chose the fate of man
[TreeTag]: # {24.08.03}
Yet not all the Eldalië were willing to forsake the Hither Lands where they had
long suffered and long dwelt; and some lingered many an age in Middle-earth.
Among those were Círdan the Shipwright, and Celeborn of Doriath, with Galadriel
his wife, who alone remained of those who led the Noldor to exile in Beleriand.
In Middle-earth dwelt also Gil-galad the High King, and with him was Elrond
Half-elven, who chose, as was granted to him, to be numbered among the Eldar;
but Elros his brother chose to abide with Men. And from these brethren alone
has come among Men the blood of the Firstborn and a strain of the spirits
divine that were before Arda; for they were the sons of Elwing, Dior's
daughter, Lúthien's son, child of Thingol and Melian; and Eärendil their father
was the son of Idril Celebrindal, Turgon's daughter of Gondolin.

## Of the eternal chaining of Morgoth, and the seed of evil sowed by him in those days
[TreeTag]: # {24.08.04}

of the World, into the Timeless Void; and a guard is set for ever on those
walls, and Eärendil keeps watch upon the ramparts of the sky. Yet the lies that
Melkor, the mighty and accursed, Morgoth Bauglir, the Power of Terror and of
Hate, sowed in the hearts of Elves and Men are a seed that does not die and
cannot be destroyed; and ever and anon it sprouts anew, and will bear dark
fruit even unto the latest days.

## Closing statement, cementing the evils of the First Age forever upon Arda
[TreeTag]: # {24.08.05}
Here ends the SILMARILLION. If it has passed from the high and the        
beautiful to darkness and ruin, that was of old the fate of Arda        
Marred; and if any change shall come and the Marring be amended, Manwë        
and Varda may know; but they have not revealed it, and it is not        
declared in the dooms of Mandos.
