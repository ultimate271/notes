Immediately on their return from Petersburg Varvara Petrovna sent her friend
abroad to "recruit"; and, indeed, it was necessary for them to part for a time,
she felt that. Stepan Trofimovitch was delighted to go.

"There I shall revive!" he exclaimed. "There, at last, I shall set to work!"
But in the first of his letters from Berlin he struck his usual note:

"My heart is broken!" he wrote to Varvara Petrovna. "I can forget nothing!
Here, in Berlin, everything brings back to me my old past, my first raptures
and my first agonies. Where is she? Where are they both? Where are you two
angels of whom I was never worthy? Where is my son, my beloved son? And last of
all, where am I, where is my old self, strong as steel, firm as a rock, when
now some Andreev, our orthodox clown with a beard, _peut briser mon existence
en deux_"--and so on.

As for Stepan Trofimovitch's son, he had only seen him twice in his life, the
first time when he was born and the second time lately in Petersburg, where the
young man was preparing to enter the university. The boy had been all his life,
as we have said already, brought up by his aunts (at Varvara Petrovna's
expense) in a remote province, nearly six hundred miles from Skvoreshniki. As
for Andreev, he was nothing more or less than our local shopkeeper, a very
eccentric fellow, a self-taught arch√¶ologist who had a passion for collecting
Russian antiquities and sometimes tried to outshine Stepan Trofimovitch in
erudition and in the progressiveness of his opinions. This worthy shopkeeper,
with a grey beard and silver-rimmed spectacles, still owed Stepan Trofimovitch
four hundred roubles for some acres of timber he had bought on the latter's
little estate (near Skvoreshniki). Though Varvara Petrovna had liberally
provided her friend with funds when she sent him to Berlin, yet Stepan
Trofimovitch had, before starting, particularly reckoned on getting that four
hundred roubles, probably for his secret expenditure, and was ready to cry when
Andreev asked leave to defer payment for a month, which he had a right to do,
since he had brought the first installments of the money almost six months in
advance to meet Stepan Trofimovitch's special need at the time.

Varvara Petrovna read this first letter greedily, and underlining in pencil the
exclamation: "Where are they both?" numbered it and put it away in a drawer. He
had, of course, referred to his two deceased wives. The second letter she
received from Berlin was in a different strain:

"I am working twelve hours out of the twenty-four." ("Eleven would be enough,"
muttered Varvara Petrovna.) "I'm rummaging in the libraries, collating,
copying, rushing about. I've visited the professors. I have renewed my
acquaintance with the delightful Dundasov family. What a charming creature
Lizaveta Nikolaevna is even now! She sends you her greetings. Her young husband
and three nephews are all in Berlin. I sit up talking till daybreak with the
young people and we have almost Athenian evenings, Athenian, I mean, only in
their intellectual subtlety and refinement. Everything is in noble style; a
great deal of music, Spanish airs, dreams of the regeneration of all humanity,
ideas of eternal beauty, of the Sistine Madonna, light interspersed with
darkness, but there are spots even on the sun! Oh, my friend, my noble,
faithful friend! In heart I am with you and am yours; with you alone, always,
_en tout pays_, even in _le pays de Makar et de ses veaux_, of which we often
used to talk in agitation in Petersburg, do you remember, before we came away.
I think of it with a smile. Crossing the frontier I felt myself in safety, a
sensation, strange and new, for the first time after so many years"--and so on
and so on.

"Come, it's all nonsense!" Varvara Petrovna commented, folding up that letter
too. "If he's up till daybreak with his Athenian nights, he isn't at his books
for twelve hours a day. Was he drunk when he wrote it? That Dundasov woman
dares to send me greetings! But there, let him amuse himself!"

The phrase "_dans le pays de Makar et de ses veaux_" meant: "wherever Makar may
drive his calves." Stepan Trofimovitch sometimes purposely translated Russian
proverbs and traditional sayings into French in the most stupid way, though no
doubt he was able to understand and translate them better. But he did it from a
feeling that it was chic, and thought it witty.

But he did not amuse himself for long. He could not hold out for four months,
and was soon flying back to Skvoreshniki. His last letters consisted of nothing
but outpourings of the most sentimental love for his absent friend, and were
literally wet with tears. There are natures extremely attached to home like
lap-dogs. The meeting of the friends was enthusiastic. Within two days
everything was as before and even duller than before. "My friend," Stepan
Trofimovitch said to me a fortnight after, in dead secret, "I have discovered
something awful for me... something new: _je suis un simple_ dependent, _et
rien de plus! Mais r-r-rien de plus._"
