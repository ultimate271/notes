    Lux Support

    Focus this game will be on using the toggle auto hotkey.


    Never once did I use it.
    I feel I played well on Varus, utilizing him as a burst champion.
    I used the R Judiciously.
    There were times I felt I could have been more focused on doing damage.

    Lux Fed 0/3 in the early game. We stayed cool and only died once
    Lethality (Sangiuine into IE)

    Decent laning phase against leblanc, she was rather passive as a player

WIN
