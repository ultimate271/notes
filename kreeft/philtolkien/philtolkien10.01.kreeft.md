# Philosophy of Language
The goal of philosophy is "Logos". Logos, like its Chinese counterpart "Tao",
is an incomparably profound and multi-valent word that means essentially three
things: (1) the ultimate nature of things, the one source of all essential
reality and intelligibility; (2) intelligence, understanding, wisdom, truth, as
the knowledge of that essential reality; and (3) communication, language,
speech, argument, explanation, or word, the expression of that knowledge.
Philosophy studies all three: the first is metaphysics, the second is
epistemology, and the third is philosophy of language. Pre-modern philosophy
specialized in the first, classical modern philosophy in the second, and
post-modern philosophy in the third.
