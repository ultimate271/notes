# 13.5 Is charity a waste?
Why were Sauron, Isildur, and Gollum unable to resist the Ring, and why were
Bilbo, Frodo, and Sam able? Part of the answer is humility, but the ultimate
answer is charity (caritas, agape), "love" in the old sense of the word, before
"love" shrunk to sex and "charity" to money. It was Frodo's love of the Shire
more than himself, his willingness to give himself up for it, and Sam's love
for his master:

"I have been too deeply hurt, Sam. I tried to save the Shire, and it has been
saved, but not for me. It must often be so, Sam, when things are in danger:
some one has to give them up, lose them, so that others may keep them" (LOTR,
p. 1006).

Amor vincit omnia: "Love (charity, self-giving, self-sacrifice) conquers all."

In a letter to his son Michael about love and marriage, Tolkien explains that
self-sacrifice is not just an ideal but a necessity in this world:

The essence of a fallen world is that the best cannot be attained by free
enjoyment, or by what is called "self-realization" (usually a nice name for
self-indulgence) . . . but by denial, by suffering. . . . No man, however truly
he loved his betrothed and bride as a young man, has lived faithful to her as a
wife in mind and body without deliberate conscious exercise of the will,
without self-denial. Too few are told that—even those brought up "in the
Church". Those outside seem seldom to have heard it (Letters, no. 43, pp.
51-52).

Then comes the most striking thing in all Tolkien's letters:

Out of the darkness of my life, so much frustrated, I put before you the one
great thing to love on earth: the Blessed Sacrament. . . . There you will find
romance, glory, honour, fidelity, and the true way of all your loves upon
earth, and more than that: Death: by the divine paradox, that which ends life,
and demands the surrender of all, and yet by the taste (or foretaste) of which
alone can what you seek in your earthly relationships (love, faithfulness, joy)
be maintained, or take on that complexion of reality, of eternal endurance,
which every man's heart desires (Letters, no. 43, pp. 53-54).

C. S. Lewis writes an almost equally unforgettable passage, on the risks and
martyrdoms of charity, in The Four Loves:

To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will
certainly be wrung and possibly be broken. If you want to make sure of keeping
it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not even to an animal. Wrap it
carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock
it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that
casket—safe, dark, motionless, airless—it will change. It will not be broken;
it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. The alternative to
tragedy, or at least to the risk of tragedy, is damnation. The only place
outside Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers and
perturbations of love is Hell (pp. 110-12).
