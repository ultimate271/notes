# Anthropology
The Greeks, who invented philosophy as well as half of all the other worthwhile
human things in the world, clearly recognized that in this world so full of
wonders, the most wonderful by far was man. Compare the famous speech to that
effect in Oedipus Rex with the twenty-eighth chapter of Job, and you will see
the source of these two great ancient civilizations, Greece and Israel.

"Know thyself" was the maxim adopted by Socrates. If the philosopher does not
know himself, he does not know who it is that knows all the other things he
knows.

Obviously, knowing the self is the first, most immediate kind of knowing. Yet
it is also the hardest, because it is the most prone to self-deception by
self-interest and rationalization, because we are too close to see ourselves
clearly, and because we alone are subjects, knowers; how can we make that same
reality an object, a thing known? Yet we must.
