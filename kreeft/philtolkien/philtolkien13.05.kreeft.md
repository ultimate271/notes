# 12.4 Is authority oppressive and obedience demeaning?
Frodo is a Marian figure. His fiat ("I will take the Ring though I do not know
the way" [LOTR, p. 264]) is strikingly similar to Mary's ("Let it be to me
according to your word" [Lk 1:38]). They are opposite sides of the same coin:
Mary consented to carry the Savior of the whole world, the Christ, to birth, to
life; and Frodo consented to carry the destroyer of the whole world, the Ring,
the Antichrist, to its death. Mary gave life to Life (Christ); Frodo gave death
to Death (the Ring).

We all, like Frodo, carry a Quest, a Task: our daily duties. They come to us,
not from us. We are free only to accept or refuse our taskâ€”and, implicitly, our
Taskmaster. None of us is a free creator or designer of his own life. "None of
us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself" (Rom 14:7). Either God, or
fate, or meaningless chance has laid upon each of us a Task, a Quest, which we
would not have chosen for ourselves. We are all Hobbits who love our Shire, our
security, our creature comforts, whether these are pipeweed, mushrooms, five
meals a day, and local gossip, or Starbucks coffees, recreational sex, and
politics. But something, some authority not named in The Lord of the Rings (but
named in The Silmarillion), has decreed that a Quest should interrupt this
delightful Epicurean garden and send us on an odyssey. We are plucked out of
our Hobbit holes and plunked down onto a Road. That gives us our fundamental
choice between obedience and disobedience. And if life is war, obedience is
essential. It is the first virtue for a soldier.

C. S. Lewis says that "obedience accepted with delight and authority exercised
with humility are the very lines along which our spirits live" (The Weight of
Glory, p. 115). And "If you ask why we should obey God, in the last resort the
answer is, 'I am.' To know God is to know that our obedience is due to Him"
(Surprised by Joy, p. 231). Like Frodo, Lewis believes in an ethic of duty and
obedience rather than an ethic of consequences: "To play well the scenes in
which we are 'on' concerns us much more than guessing about future scenes" (The
World's Last Night, p. 104).
