# 12.2 Why must we be heroes?
A hero is a person who acts courageously. In a fallen world, courage is among
the most important of virtues. Chesterton, musing on Gethsemane and Calvary,
notes that Christianity is "the only religion which adds courage to the virtues
of the Creator". Tolkien says, "The 'good' of the world depends on the
behaviour of an individual in circumstances which demand of him suffering and
endurance far beyond the normal . .. demand a strength of body and mind which
he does not possess" (Letters, no. 181, p. 234).

A recent book on The Lord of the Rings notes that

a big part of the reason Frodo's courage is so inspiring is its contrast to his
culture. His upbringing nurtured the pursuit of happy ease. . . . Have you ever
wondered why our favorite stories tend to include an ordinary person overcoming
great odds to accomplish something extraordinary? It's because the capacity and
desire to be heroic resides deep within each of us . . . Rocky Balboa . . .
Luke Sky-walker . . . Forrest Gump . . . William Wallace . . . Gideon .
Wilberforce . . . Rosa Parks.2

C. S. Lewis says of courage, "As Johnson points out, where courage is not, no
other virtue can survive except by accident" (Surprised by Joy, p. 161).
"Courage is not simply one of the virtues, but the form of every virtue at the
testing point, which means, at the point of highest reality" (The Screwtape
Letters, p. 148). Lewis points out that Jesus was not a man of great natural
courage, as seen by Gethsemane. Neither was Tolkien, as seen by Letter 210.
Jesus was like Frodo!
