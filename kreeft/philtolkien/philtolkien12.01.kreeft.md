# Ethics: The War of Good and Evil
Ethics is certainly the most practically important division of philosophy, and
the one most people think of first. But the most important part of ethics is
not the one most people think of first. It is not the ethics of war, or sex, or
money, or technology. It is not the ethics of anything but the foundations of
ethics. Foundations are the most important part of any building, as roots to a
tree. We thus first turn to what might be called "the metaphysical foundations
of morality".

Morality is like the marching orders in the war between good and evil. Tolkien
and Lewis strongly side with the traditional "natural moral law" view that this
war, this distinction, and this goodness are objectively real. But is evil also
objectively real, and, if so, is it equally real and equally powerful compared
to good?
