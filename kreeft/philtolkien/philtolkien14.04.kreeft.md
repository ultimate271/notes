# 13.3 What should you give away?
Gift giving is a moral virtue, the actualization of charity. But it is also a
practical necessity. Many of the gifts given to the Hobbits save their lives
and save the Quest, from the mithril coat Bilbo gave Frodo to the Phial of
Galadriel, in which was trapped the light from the Silmarils. Even a simple
thing like Sam's rope, given to him by the Elves in Lorien, twice saved them:
in descending a cliff and in capturing Gollum.

Bilbo gave up his hoard of dragon gold, and also his home and possessions to
Frodo. Frodo follows the same path, giving up his life in the Shire both at the
beginning, when he leaves, and at the end, when he finds that "you can't go
home again". Most important of all, he gives up the Ring.

Giving the Ring away, of course, is the supreme act of giving, because the Ring
is unlimited power and can get you anything you want. Only three succeed in
doing this, and they are all Hobbits: Bilbo, Frodo, and Sam. Hobbits are good
at giving: on their birthday they do not receive gifts but give them. Their
happiness shows what Jesus says: "It is more blessed to give than to receive"
(Acts 20:35). Even Gandalf's gift of fireworks, while not "serious", is
symbolically appropriate because fireworks give us joy only by their "dying".

Unlike all other Quests in the world's literature, the whole point of the Ring
Quest is not to get something (e.g., Jason's Golden Fleece, Odysseus's wife and
home, Gilgamesh's immortality, or even Adam's [Milton's] Paradise Lost); but to
give something up: to give this "gift" back to its maker and origin (thus
destroying it), thus reversing the process of greed, materialism, idolatry,
fetishism, and externalization that it symbolizes.

Frodo sacrifices not only the Ring but himself. He has no hope of surviving the
journey; and when he does, he has no peace in Middle-earth. The Lord of the
Rings ends with Frodo's "death" at the Havensâ€”a real leave-taking, though not
an ordinary biological death but a Mary-like "assumption into Heaven".

The importance of gift giving can hardly be exaggerated, especially when we
realize that the greatest gifts any of us receive are the people who have been
put into our lives for us to love.

C. S. Lewis notes that "it is much harder to receive than to give, but, I
think, much more blessed."1 For "the proper aim of giving is to put the
recipient in a state where he no longer needs our gift" (The Four Loves, p. 76).
