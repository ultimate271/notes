# Ethics: The "Hard" Virtues
Virtues can be classified in many ways. One way is "hard" versus "soft". Our
ancestors were better at the "hard" ones, like courage, duty, honor, chastity,
and obedience. We are better at the "soft" ones, like pity, mercy, sensitivity,
and humility. We are shocked by their cruelty; they would be equally shocked by
our laxity.
