# 9.5 Why is music so powerful?
The most powerful and magical language is music. The reason for this is that
music is the original language. Music is the language of creation. In The
Silmarillion (as in Lewis's creation story in The Magician's Nephew), God and
His angels sing the world into being:"In the beginning, Eru, the One, who in
the Elvish tongue is named Iluvatar, made the Ainur of his thought; and they
made a great Music before him. In this Music the World was begun"
(Silmarillion, p. 25).

It is not that the music was in the world but that the world was in the music.
This is "the music of the spheres", in which everything is, the "Song of Songs"
that includes all songs. All matter, space, time, and history are in this
primal language.

Plato knew the power of music. In the Republic it is the first step in
education in the good society and the first step in corruption in the bad one.
Nothing is more powerful to the good society, to education, to human happiness
in this world.

Music is not ornamented poetry, and poetry is not ornamented prose. Poetry is
fallen music, and prose is fallen poetry. Prose is not the original language;
it is poetry made practical. Even poetry is not the original language; it is
music made speakable, it is the words of music separated from their music. In
the beginning was music.

The Lord of the Rings is full of singing. One of its indices lists fifty-six
songs or poems. The Hobbits sing high hymns to Elbereth and homespun Walking
Songs and Bath Songs. Tolkien, like Bombadil, is a writer of prose who is
bursting with poetry and music. Peter Beagle calls him "a writer whose own
prose is itself taut with poetry".5

Music is an essential part of Elvish enchantment. When the Fellowship enters
Lothlorien, Sam says, "I feel as if I was inside a song, if you take my
meaning" (LOTR, p. 342). And we say the same when we enter The Lord of the
Rings.

The last division of philosophy that will ever be understood clearly and
adequately by reason is aesthetics, and within aesthetics, music.
