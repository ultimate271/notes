# Philosophical Theology
"Theology" means thinking or reasoning (logos) about God (theos). Philosophical
theology, or natural theology as distinct from religious theology or
supernaturally revealed theology, does not presuppose faith in any religion or
religious revelation. It is part of philosophy; its instrument is reason.

Metaphysics is that division of philosophy which deals with being as such, all
being, being universally. Philosophical theology is that division of philosophy
which deals with what reason can know about the First Being, the Absolute
Being, or the Most Perfect Being.

In most Eastern thought there is no distinction between metaphysics and
theology because there is no distinction between God and all reality. That is
the substance of Eastern enlightenment. God is not thought of as a distinct
being who created the universe, but simply as being itself. Everything is God,
or a manifestation of God, a part of God, or a dream of God. The technical term
for this is "pantheism" ("pan" = "everything"). In Western thought, there is a
distinction between metaphysics and theology because there is a distinction
between being in general and God in particular. In Western paganism there are
many gods, who are finite, imperfect beings, part of the sum total of being,
while in Jewish, Christian, and Muslim theism, God is the distinct,
transcendent Creator of all finite beings.

The Lord of the Rings is a book about pagan pre-Christian times written by a
Christian. Both the gods of paganism and the God of Christianity are characters
in the drama, while pantheism gives you a God who is neither a character nor
dramatic. Both paganism and Christianity give you a distinction between God or
the gods and other things, and therefore a distinction between metaphysics and
theology.
