# 9.3 Are there right and wrong words?
If things come to us in their names, if language is the "house of being", then
the power of things comes to us in the power of their names. Words have power,
not only to communicate, intellectually, and not only to suggest, emotionally,
but also a magical power that can produce physical effects.

There are many examples of this in The Lord of the Rings: Bombadil is the
clearest one. His words save Merry from Old Man Willow and Frodo from the
Barrow-wight, for "None has ever caught him yet, for Tom, he is the master: His
songs are stronger songs, and his feet are faster" (LOTR, p. 139).

Frodo too uses the "magical" power of words: when he calls Tom's name, two
miracles happen, one spiritual and one physical. The name conjures up both
Frodo's courage and Tom, who actually comes. If we find this unconvincing, it
shows how little we have taken God at His word when He repeatedly promises the
same thing Bombadil did. To put the promise in contemporary words, "You just
call out My Name, and you know, wherever I am, I'll come running to see you
again. . . ."

We know there are words that sacramentally effect what they signify, there are
operative words, there are magic words. Two of the most familiar "magic words"
are "I love you" and "I hate you." These are not labels for communication; they
are spiritual weapons, arrows that pierce through flesh and into hearts. The
whole of The Lord of the Rings is an armor-piercing rocket that can get even
into our underground bunkers.

The most powerful words are proper names, names of persons or places. When the
Black Rider bangs on Fatty Bulger's door in Buckland saying, "Open in the name
of Mordor", all the authority and power and terror of Mordor are really present
there. When Frodo, on Weathertop, faces the Black Rider, "he heard himself
crying aloud, 'O Elbereth! Gilthoniel!'" (LOTR, p. 191), as he struck the Rider
with his sword. Afterward, Aragorn says, "All blades perish that pierce that
dreadful King. More deadly to him was the name of Elbereth" (LOTR, p. 193).

In Shelob's lair Frodo speaks in tongues again: "'Aiya Earendil Elenion
Ancalima!' he cried, and knew not what he had spoken; for it seemed that
another voice spoke through his" (LOTR, p. 704). And when the tiny Hobbit with
the tiny sword advanced on the most hideous creature in Middle-earth with the
phial of Galadriel and the name of Galadriel, Shelob cowered.

What's in a name? In the name of Jesus, devils were exorcised, Hell defeated,
and Heaven's gates opened for us.

What's in a name? Everything. In a name the whole universe was created.

That name was the Word of God, the Mind of God, the Logos.

What's in a name? Moses asked God that question at the burning bush, and God
answered, "I am."
