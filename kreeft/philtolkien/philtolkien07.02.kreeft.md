# 6.1 Is knowledge always good?
It sounds scandalous to any rationalist, classical or modern, but sometimes it
is "better not to know" (LOTR, p. 448). Sometimes knowing is dangerous.
"Perilous to us all are the devices of an art deeper than we possess ourselves"
(LOTR, p. 583). We can control the world but we cannot control our own control;
and if we do not know ourselves, we will not know that truth.

Thus knowledge (as distinct from wisdom) cannot be the supreme good, for it is
compatible with evil, just as power is.

Especially when the knowledge is only by analysis, by breaking the thing into
parts. "He that breaks a thing in order to find out what it is has left the
path of wisdom" (Letters, no. 346, p. 424). This is Gollum's path:

He was interested in roots and beginnings; he dived into deep pools; he
burrowed under trees and growing plants; he tunneled into green mounds; and he
ceased to look up at the hill-tops, or the leaves on trees, or the flowers
opening in the air: his head and his eyes were downward.. [H]e used [the ring]
to find out secrets, and he put his knowledge to crooked and malicious uses. .
. . The ring had given him power according to his stature.... All the great
"secrets" under the mountains had turned out to be just empty night: there was
nothing more to find out, nothing worth doing (LOTR, pp. 51-52, 54).

One wonders how much of the above is a description of our own culture's
Gollum-like exchange of ancient wisdom for modern knowledge. One also suspects
that we all really know this, in our unconscious, for that is where language
comes from, and our language does not say "modern wisdom".

The ranks of literary critics of fantasy are full of Gollums. Tolkien says of
Faerie, "Its very richness and strangeness tie the tongue of a traveler who
would report them. And while he is there it is dangerous for him to ask too
many questions, lest the gates should be shut and the keys be lost" ("On
Fairy-Stories", p. 33). "Faerie . . . has many ingredients, but analysis will
not necessarily discover the secret of the whole" (ibid., p. 30).

Tolkien says, "As a story, I think it is good that there should be a lot of
things unexplained (especially if an explanation actually exists). . . . There
must be some enigmas, as there always are. Tom Bombadil is one (intentionally)"
(Letters, no. 144, p. 174). Any good storyteller always suggests more than he
says, or even knows, to give us the sense of a vast sea of wisdom underlying
the story, and a sense of our own smallness, and these two senses together
elicit wonder. Fantasy does this better than science fiction, because science
fiction deals with the scientifically possible, thus with problems and puzzles
that could in principle be solved and some day probably will, while fantasy
deals with things beyond the capacity of natural science to explain or control.

Any theist could explain and justify the wisdom of ignorance. As C. S. Lewis
put it, "[H]ow can the characters in a play guess the plot? We are not the
playwright, we are not the producer, we are not even the audience. We are on
the stage. To play well the scenes in which we are 'on' concerns us much more
than to guess about the scenes that follow it."1
