# 13.4 Does mercy trump justice?
"Pity" sometimes means a feeling, but when it is used in such a way as to be
virtually identical with mercy (as it is in The Lord of the Rings), it is a
deed.

It is mercy, not justice or courage or even heroism, that alone can defeat
evil.

This is seen strikingly in the fact that at the Crack of Doom "Frodo 'failed'.
. . . One must face the fact the power of Evil in the world is not finally
resistible by incarnate creatures, however 'good'" (i>Letters, no. 191, p.
252). As Gandalf foresaw, only "the pity of Bilbo [in sparing Gollum] will rule
the fate of many" (LOTR, p. 60) and save Middle-earth. Frodo's "failure" shows
that pity is necessary:

Regarding the failure of Frodo: Very few seem to have observed it. But
following the logic of the plot, it was clearly inevitable, as an event. And
surely it is a more significant and real event than a mere "fairy-story" ending
in which the hero is indomitable? . . .

Frodo deserved all honour because he spent every drop of his power of will and
body, and that was just sufficient to bring him to the destined point, and no
further. Few others, possibly no others of his time, would have got so far. The
Other Power then took over: the Writer of the Story (by which I do not mean
myself), "that one ever-present Person who is never absent and never named"
(Letters, no. 192, pp. 252-53).

Because this One is not in time, He can make something in our past as well as
in our present affect the future. The salvation of Middle-earth, and of Frodo,
is achieved by Frodo's (and Bilbo's, and Sam's, and Aragorn's, and Faramir's)
previous pity and mercy to Gollum.

That strange element in the World that we call Pity or Mercy... is also an
absolute requirement in moral judgement since it is present in the Divine
nature. . . . It must lead to the use of two different scales of "morality." To
ourselves we must present the absolute ideal without compromise, for ...if we
do not aim at the highest we shall certainly fall short of the utmost that we
could achieve. To others . . . we must apply a scale tempered by "mercy"
...since we can with good will do this without the bias inevitable in
judgements of ourselves (Letters, no. 246, p. 326).

What motivates that pity? Not mere feeling, and not utility or worldly
prudence. It can seem ridiculously imprudent. But Frodo was not naive; he knew
Gollum wanted only to betray him and his promise and get the Ring back. "To
pity him, to forebear to kill him, was . . . a mystical belief in the ultimate
value-in-itself of pity and generosity even if disastrous in the world of time"
(Letters, no. 192, pp. 252-53).

Jesus did the same to Judasâ€”and with the same result.
