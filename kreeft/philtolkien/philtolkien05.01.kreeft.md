# Cosmology
Cosmology is a division of philosophy seldom seen anymore because most
philosophers think its questions have all been answered by the natural
sciences, ever since the discovery of the modern scientific method.

But there are certainly some questions about the cosmos that the physical
sciences do not have the method for answering, while philosophy does: for
instance, the justification of principles science takes for granted, such as
the uniformity of nature, causality, and the correlation between objective
intelligibility in nature and subjective intelligence in man's mind, as well as
nonquantifiable questions like the beauty and value of nature, and why we find
a mysterious nonutilitarian joy in things like forests, stars, and storms.
