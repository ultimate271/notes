# 9.4 Is there an original, universal, natural language?
There is an old myth of an original language. It is in Plato (the "Cratylus")
and the Bible (the story of the Tower of Babel, answered by Pentecost). If this
is true, it explains why every proper name of Tolkien's seems exactly right.
(This is a power even many of his critics marvel at.) When we read them we are
remembering (Plato's anamnesis); our cognition is a recognition. Our "word
detector" buzzes when we meet the Right Word, the Platonic Idea, the Jungian
Archetype. We experience discovery rather than invention, as when Mercury
descends to earth in the "Descent of the Gods" chapter in C. S. Lewis's That
Hideous Strength:

It was as if the words spoke themselves through him from some strong place at a
distance—or as if they were not words at all but the present operations of God.
. . . For this was the language spoken before the Fall and beyond the Moon and
the meanings were not given to the syllables by chance, or skill, or long
tradition, but truly inherent in them as the shape of the great Sun is inherent
in the little water-drop. This was Language herself, as she first sprang at
Maleldil's bidding out of the molten quicksilver of the star called Mercury on
Earth, but Viritrilbia in Deep Heaven (p. 319).

The most important proper name to you is your own. In C. S. Lewis's anthology
of 365 selections from George Mac-Donald, the one most readers find
unforgettable is his commentary on Revelation 2:17 ("I will give him a white
stone, with a new name written on the stone, which no one knows except him who
receives it"):

The giving of the white stone with the new name is the communication of what
God thinks about the man to the man. It is the divine judgment, the solemn holy
doom of the righteous man, the "Come, thou blessed," spoken to the individual.
. . . The true name is one which expresses the character, the nature, the
meaning of the person who bears it. It is the man's own symbol—his soul's
picture, in a word—the sign which belongs to him and to no one else. Who can
give a man this, his own name? God alone. For no one but God sees who the man
is. . . . It is only when the man has become his name that God gives him the
stone with the name upon it, for then first can he understand what his name
signifies. . . . God's name for a man must be the expression of His own idea of
the man, that being whom He had in His thought when He began to make the child,
and whom He kept in His thought through the long process of creation that went
to realize the idea. To tell the name is to seal the success—to say "In thee
also I am well pleased."4
