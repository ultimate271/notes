Introduction
The Importance of Belief
# The Importance of Belief
The human brain is an engine of belief. Our minds continually consume, produce,
and attempt to integrate ideas about ourselves and the world that purport to be
true: Iran is developing nuclear weapons; the seasonal flu can be spread
through casual contact; I actually look better with gray hair. What must we do
to believe such statements? What, in other words, must a brain do to accept
such propositions as true? This question marks the intersection of many fields:
psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, economics, political science, and even
jurisprudence.22

Belief also bridges the gap between facts and values. We form beliefs about
facts: and belief in this sense constitutes most of what we know about the
world—through science, history, journalism, etc. But we also form beliefs about
values: judgments about morality, meaning, personal goals, and life’s larger
purpose. While they might differ in certain respects, beliefs in these two
domains share very important features. Both types of belief make tacit claims
about right and wrong: claims not merely about how we think and behave, but
about how we should think and behave. Factual beliefs like “water is two parts
hydrogen and one part oxygen” and ethical beliefs like “cruelty is wrong” are
not expressions of mere preference. To really believe either proposition is
also to believe that you have accepted it for legitimate reasons. It is,
therefore, to believe that you are in compliance with certain norms—that you
are sane, rational, not lying to yourself, not confused, not overly biased,
etc. When we believe that something is factually true or morally good, we also
believe that another person, similarly placed, should share our belief. This
seems unlikely to change. In chapter 3, we will see that both the logical and
neurological properties of belief further suggest that the divide between facts
and values is illusory.
