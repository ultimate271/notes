Introduction
Can Suffering Be Good?
# Can Suffering Be Good?
It seems clear that ascending the slopes of the moral landscape may sometimes
require suffering. It may also require negative social emotions, like guilt and
indignation. Again, the analogy with physical health seems useful: we must
occasionally experience some unpleasantness—medication, surgery, etc.—in order
to avoid greater suffering or death. This principle seems to apply throughout
our lives. Merely learning to read or to play a new sport can produce feelings
of deep frustration. And yet there is little question that acquiring such
skills generally improves our lives. Even periods of depression may lead to
better life decisions and to creative insights.26 This seems to be the way our
minds work. So be it.

Of course, this principle also applies to civilization as a whole. Merely
making necessary improvements to a city’s infrastructure greatly inconveniences
millions of people. And unintended effects are always possible. For instance,
the most dangerous road on earth now appears to be a two-lane highway between
Kabul and Jalalabad. When it was unpaved, cratered, and strewn with boulders,
it was comparatively safe. But once some helpful Western contractors improved
it, the driving skills of the local Afghans were finally liberated from the
laws of physics. Many now have a habit of passing slow-moving trucks on blind
curves, only to find themselves suddenly granted a lethally unimpeded view of a
thousand-foot gorge.27 Are there lessons to be learned from such missteps in
the name of progress? Of course. But they do not negate the reality of
progress. Again, the difference between the Good Life and the Bad Life could
not be clearer: the question, for both individuals and groups, is how can we
most reliably move in one direction and avoid moving in the other?
