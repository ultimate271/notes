THE FUTURE OF HAPPINESS
# THE FUTURE OF HAPPINESS
No one has ever mistaken me for an optimist. And yet when I consider one of the
more pristine sources of pessimism—the moral development of our species—I find
reasons for hope. Despite our perennial bad behavior, our moral progress seems
to me unmistakable. Our powers of empathy are clearly growing. Today, we are
surely more likely to act for the benefit of humanity as a whole than at any
point in the past.

Of course, the twentieth century delivered some unprecedented horrors. But
those of us who live in the developed world are becoming increasingly disturbed
by our capacity to do one another harm. We are less tolerant of “collateral
damage” in times of war—undoubtedly because we now see images of it—and we are
less comfortable with ideologies that demonize whole populations, justifying
their abuse or outright destruction.

Consider the degree to which racism in the United States has diminished in the
last hundred years. Racism is still a problem, of course. But the evidence of
change is undeniable. Most readers will have seen photos of lynchings from the
first half of the twentieth century, in which whole towns turned out, as though
for a carnival, simply to enjoy the sight of some young man or woman being
tortured to death and strung up on a tree or lamppost for all to see. These
pictures often reveal bankers, lawyers, doctors, teachers, church elders,
newspaper editors, policemen, even the occasional senator and congressman,
smiling in their Sunday best, having consciously posed for a postcard photo
under a dangling, lacerated, and often partially cremated person. Such images
are shocking enough. But realize that these genteel people often took souvenirs
of the body—teeth, ears, fingers, kneecaps, genitalia, and internal organs—home
to show their friends and family. Sometimes, they even displayed these ghoulish
trophies in their places of business.1

Consider the following response to boxer Jack Johnson’s successful title
defense against Jim Jeffries, the so-called “Great White Hope”:



A Word to the Black Man:



Do not point your nose too high



Do not swell your chest too much



Do not boast too loudly



Do not be puffed up



Let not your ambition be inordinate



Or take a wrong direction



Remember you have done nothing at all



You are just the same member of society you were last week



You are on no higher plane



Deserve no new consideration



And will get none



No man will think a bit higher of you



Because your complexion is the same



Of that of the victor at Reno2

A modern reader can only assume that this dollop of racist hatred appeared on a
leaflet printed by the Ku Klux Klan. On the contrary, this was the measured
opinion of the editors at the Los Angeles Times exactly a century ago. Is it
conceivable that our mainstream media will ever again give voice to such
racism? I think it far more likely that we will proceed along our current path:
racism will continue to lose its subscribers; the history of slavery in the
United States will become even more flabbergasting to contemplate; and future
generations will marvel at the the ways that we, too, failed in our commitment
to the common good. We will embarrass our descendants, just as our ancestors
embarrass us. This is moral progress.

I am bolstered in this expectation by my view of the moral landscape: the
belief that morality is a genuine sphere of human inquiry, and not a mere
product of culture, suggests that progress is possible. If moral truths
transcend the contingencies of culture, human beings should eventually converge
in their moral judgments. I am painfully aware, however, that we are living at
a time when Muslims riot by the hundreds of thousands over cartoons, Catholics
oppose condom use in villages decimated by AIDS, and one of the few “moral”
judgments guaranteed to unite the better part of humanity is that homosexuality
is an abomination. And yet I can detect moral progress even while believing
that most people are profoundly confused about good and evil. I may be a
greater optimist than I thought.
