# Belief and Reasoning
There is a close relationship between belief and reasoning. Many of our beliefs
are the product of inferences drawn from particular instances (induction) or
from general principles (deduction), or both. Induction is the process by which
we extrapolate from past observations to novel instances, anticipate future
states of the world, and draw analogies from one domain to another.57 Believing
that you probably have a pancreas (because people generally have the same
parts), or interpreting the look of disgust on your son’s face to mean that he
doesn’t like Marmite, are examples of induction. This mode of thinking is
especially important for ordinary cognition and for the practice of science,
and there have been a variety of efforts to model it computationally.58
Deduction, while less central to our lives, is an essential component of any
logical argument.59 If you believe that gold is more expensive than silver, and
silver more expensive than tin, deduction reveals that you also believe gold to
be more expensive than tin. Induction allows us to move beyond the facts
already in hand; deduction allows us to make the implications of our current
beliefs more explicit, to search for counterexamples, and to see whether our
views are logically coherent. Of course, the boundaries between these (and
other) forms of reasoning are not always easy to specify, and people succumb to
a wide range of biases in both modes.

It is worth reflecting on what a reasoning bias actually is: a bias is not
merely a source of error; it is a reliable pattern of error. Every bias,
therefore, reveals something about the structure of the human mind. And
diagnosing a pattern of errors as a “bias” can only occur with reference to
specific norms—and norms can sometimes be in conflict. The norms of logic, for
instance, don’t always correspond to the norms of practical reasoning. An
argument can be logically valid, but unsound in that it contains a false
premise and, therefore, leads to a false conclusion (e.g., Scientists are
smart; smart people do not make mistakes; therefore, scientists do not make
mistakes).60 Much research on deductive reasoning suggests that people have a
“bias” for sound conclusions and will judge a valid argument to be invalid if
its conclusion lacks credibility. It’s not clear that this “belief bias” should
be considered a symptom of native irrationality. Rather, it seems an instance
in which the norms of abstract logic and practical reason may simply be in
conflict.

Neuroimaging studies have been performed on various types of human reasoning.61
As we have seen, however, accepting the fruits of such reasoning (i.e., belief)
seems to be an independent process. While this is suggested by my own
neuroimaging research, it also follows directly from the fact that reasoning
accounts only for a subset of our beliefs about the world. Consider the
following statements:



1. All known soil samples contain bacteria; so the soil in my garden probably
contains bacteria as well (induction).



2. Dan is a philosopher, all philosophers have opinions about Nietzsche;
therefore, Dan has an opinion about Nietzsche (deduction).



3. Mexico shares a border with the United States.



4. You are reading at this moment.


Each of these statements must be evaluated by different channels of neural
processing (and only the first two require reasoning). And yet each has the
same cognitive valence: being true, each inspires belief (or being believed,
each is deemed “true”). Such cognitive acceptance allows any apparent truth to
take its place in the economy of our thoughts and actions, at which time it
becomes as potent as its propositional content demands.
