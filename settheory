The purpose of this document is to informally talk of set theory from
a functional programming point of view. We will start by refering to sets
as a data type, similar to lists, and work to show that sets behave like
a member of MonadPlus. From this, we can develop notions such as set
equality, subsets, and elements in terms of functional lambdas.

Since this is Psuedocode, I will not be concerned with things such as
namespace clashes and order of operations. It is generally obvious the
order of infix operators, and I may at some point work on a table detailing
the fixity of operators, but at this point if there is eggregious ambiguity,
I will use parens to resolve it.

Also, I will use {a} to denote Set a, similar to [a] denotes List a. This
liberty is to aid in readability, since again, this is not code that is
meant to be compiled.

A note on computability. The purpose here is to create a mathematical framework
of numbers in set theory using lambdas because I understand lambdas better than
I understand set theory, and I'm a recent Haskell advocate and want to show
how lambda caluclus can be used to reason about sets. However, I am not concerned
with the computability of any of our functions, and many of them could indeed,
and as a matter of fact will indeed, run forever without halting. This is not
due to laziness on my part, this is a fundamental property of some of the
functions which we are going to be working with. This is okay,
because the fact that these functions are not computable as they are written
doesn't make the mathematics that they represent any less true, only impossible
to compute. It is a subtle distinction, but you will commonly see me fold
an infinite set, and use that value in some other function. I don't mind that
the infinite fold doesn't halt, all that matters is that the structure is foldable.

    Data Set a = Null | Set a (Set a)

Note the similarity to lists. In fact, many bookkeeping notions can be resolved
by creating a toList and fromList function, so while we could write functions
such as fmap and >>=, it becomes easier to just say that we are not concerned with
implementation details and instead are more interested in just that the
operation exists and that it behaves in the way it should. For instance,
our implementation of insert is O(n) and we could do O(log n) if we were
to implement sets as binary trees, but we don't care and would rather the
simplicity and transparency.

--FUNDAMENTAL OPERATIONS
    (@) :: a -> {a} -> Bool
    insert :: a -> {a} -> {a}
    delete :: a -> {a} -> {a}

    a @ Null = False
    a @ (Set b s) = a == b || a @ s

    insert a Null = Set a Null
    insert a s@(Set b t) = if a == b then s else (Set b $ insert a t)

    delete a Null = Null
    delete a (Set b s) = if a == b then s else (Set b $ delete a s)

Many of these instance declarations could be defined similarly to lists,
so we will not bother to write them here. It is worth noting that the
difference between sets and lists at this point is only that we don't
have the concept of "head" and "tail" and that we can only add and remove elements
using the insert and delete function, requiring the uniqueness property of sets
For most all purposes, syntactically speaking, one can use lists to the
same effect as sets and acheive similar results

    instance Foldable Set where
        foldr = ...
    instance Functor Set where
        (<$>) = ...
    instance Applicative Set where ...
    instance Monad Set where ...
        return a = Set a Null
        (>>=) = ...
    instance MonadZero Set where
        mempty = Null
    instance MonadPlus Set where
        (++) = fold insert
    instance MonadMinus Set where
        (--) = fold delete
    instance Eq Set where
        Null == Null = True
        (==) a b = a -- b == Null && b -- a == Null
    instance Ord Set where
        (<=) a b = a ++ b == b

The first intesting instance declaration is MonadPlus, and here we
have defined it in the way that would indicate that ++ means set union.
Next, we make up a typeclass called MonadMinus, and define -- to mean
set subtraction, or a -- b = the set of all element in a with the elements of b
removed. It is then easist to talk of equality such that, if you remove
all b from a and get the null set, and you remove all a from b and get
the null set, then a == b. We then define a partial ordering as the standard
subset definition. It is worth noting that this is not a full ordering,
because there exists sets a and b where neither a <= b nor b <= a
so this is not a proper haskell class Ord, but again, we're not concerned
with specifics.

At this point I would like to write down some laws that are unique to sets
for the operations we have written down. In theory one could make a Set
typeclass using any @ and insert that obey these laws, but we're not going
to do that.

--LAWS
    a @ insert a _ = True
    insert a $ insert a s = insert a s
    a @ s -> insert a (delete a s) = s
    not (a @ s) -> delete a (insert a s) = s
    insert a s == s <-> a @ s
    delete a s == s <-> not (a @ s)

I could keep going with laws about subsets and inserts and such, but one
could look in your favorite book on ZFC set theory to find them.

At this point we are missing definitions for intersection, and it is not
immediately obvious how to go about defining it recursively. However, note that
since we have defined set as an instance of monad, we have the power of
list comprehensions at our disposal, so long as we get past the notion of
correct syntax. We can then write intersection as

    (^^) s t = {x <- s | x @ t}

or in words, s ^^ t is the set of all x in s such that x is also an element of t
Obviously there is some syntactic sugar to define here, as it would be more
correct to write

    (^^) s t = s >>= (\x -> guard (x @ t) >> return x)

but no one wants to try and read that. We will suppose that any sugar needed
is defined as one would expect, being careful in not adding anything new
by applying magical sugaring.

Lastly, I would like to define union and intersect, as well as

    union :: {{a}} -> {a}
    union = fold (++) Null
    intersect :: {{a}} -> {a}
    intersect Null = Null
    intersect (Set s ss) = fold (^^) s ss

At this juncture, we have defined all of the operations we would like to use on
sets, given we apply symetry to definitions such as a <= b <-> b >= a
where neccesary. Now, I would like to begin to formulate the ordinal numbers
using these sets, and define operations on these sets in the way we would like to.

Before we begin, I must have a word about using numerals. Haskell, and any
other programming language, will always have the numerals built in to the
language. This is well and good for saying things like VonNeuman 0 == Null,
but in general, the built in integers will only be used for functions such as this,
and no where else. This exposes the purity of set theory, and a similar notion
will be used when talking of surreal numbers. Also, we will be able to say
things like (VonNeuman (a + b) = VonNeuman a + VonNeuman b), and in general
this should hold for any operator on numbers, meaning that the operation on
the sets should produce the same result as applying the operation on the numbers,
but here we must be careful in distinguishing sets and numbers.

So at this juncture, we need to have a conversation about the type of ordinals.
We are working with sets of sets here. One could imagine a set of sets, and
another layer deeper of sets of sets of sets. We are taking this to its inductive
extreme, saying that an ordinal is a set of sets, where each set is a set of sets.
I am not sure at this moment if this notion is absurd or not, but for now we will
go with it and see if we run into anything silly.

This is of course syntactically wrong, as Set has kind * -> *, so if a is Set
then Set a still has kind * -> * since a has kind * -> *. However, as a sort
of justification for this, we say that Null doesn't depend on a, and the Set
constructor can except anything that we've created as a valid set so far for
either of its arguments. So Null is a set and Set Null Null is the set that
contains Null as its only element. Set (Set Null Null) Null is the set that
contains (Set Null Null) as its only element, call it {Null} and
Set Null (Set (Set Null Null) Null) is the set that contains Null and {Null}
as its only elements. So we see that this isn't too absurd after all,
even if it is a gross abuse of notation, and definitely not mathematically rigorous.

Set Null

    Type Ordinal = {{}}

    zero :: Ordinal
    succ :: Ordinal -> Ordinal
    max :: {Ordinal} -> Ordinal
    min :: {Ordinal} -> Ordinal
    pred :: Ordinal -> Ordinal
    (+) :: Ordinal -> Ordinal -> Ordinal
    (-) :: Ordinal -> Ordinal -> Ordinal
    (*) :: Ordinal -> Ordinal -> Ordinal
    (^) :: Ordinal -> Ordinal -> Ordinal
    sum :: {Ordinal} -> Ordinal
    prod :: {Ordinal} -> Ordinal
    diff :: Ordinal -> Ordinial -> Ordinal

    zero = Null
    succ s = s ++ insert s Null
    max = union
    min = intersection
    pred = max
    (+) a Null = a
    (+) a b = succ a + pred b
    (-) a Null = a
    (-) a b = pred a - pred b
    (*) a Null = Null
    (*) a b = a + a * pred b
    (^) a Null = {Null}
    (^) a b = a * a ^ pred b
    sum = fold (+) Null
    prod = fold (*) {Null}
    diff a Null = a
    diff Null b = b
    diff a b = diff (pred a) (pred b)

This is nice, because for Ordinals x and y, x <= y iff x is a subset of y,
so we have already defined notions of order and equality of Ordinals. One
can also prove to oneself that the usual laws of addition and multiplication
hold, such as a + Null = Null + a = a, a * {Null} = {Null} * a = a, a + b = b + a,
a <= b -> a + c <= b + c, etc.

Before we continue, I want to talk about pred and (-). These operations are
indeed closed under the ordinals, but they don't neccesarily have the properties
one would come to expect. For instance, pred zero == zero, so it is not the case
that succ . pred $ x == x as we might expect, because, succ . pred $ Null
is {Null}. Likewise, we cannot take for granted that (x - y) + y == x, because
if y >= x then (x - y) + y == y. We have defined pred and (-) in this way
so that we can reason about some properties of certain sets easily, as the
reader will find when he gets to the topic of the fundamental theorem of arithmatic.

Also, I would like to briefly discuss the difference between (-) and diff.
They are very similar functions, the difference being that (-) will take a - b
in the usual way one learns in kindergarden and if the result is negative, the
result of a - b is Null. On the other hand, the diff of a and b could be thought
of as the max {a - b, b - a}, or in less cryptic terms, the absolute value
of a - b. We could show a whole bunch of inequalities using (-) and diff, such
as diff a b == (-) a b <-> a >= b and so on, but we will not list them here.

We now define a way of talking about ordinals in terms of built in operators
Here, Integer refers to some way a compiler will reason about integers,
different than sets. We don't know in what way these integers are encoded,
nor should we care, as long as we have the operations defined above for
another encoding of integers these functions will work, one just has
to be careful in distinguishing + :: Ordinal -> Ordinal -> Ordinal with
+ :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer. In this way, we could define integers
using a church encoding of lambda expressions, and define the operations on
church numerals, and these functions would still be entirely valid and correct.

    VonNeumann :: Integer -> Ordinal
    VonNeumann 0 = Null
    VonNeumann x = succ . VonNeumann $ x - 1

    Ord2Int :: Ordinal -> Integer
    Ord2Int Null = 0
    Ord2Int a = 1 + Ord2Int (pred a)

The first thing to show is that Ord2Int . VonNeumann = id, and I don't feel like
writing a proof but it is pretty clear once one understands the definitions.
One could also prove things like a <= b -> VonNeumann a <= VonNeumann b or
a + b == c -> VonNeuman a + VonNeumann b == VonNeuman c, and again,
I am not going to write a proof but encourage the reader to verify any of these
properties to whatever degree of rigor they see fit.

Now we are going to define Z+ in terms of the Ordinals

    type Integer = {{}}
    Z+ :: {Ordinal}
    Z+ = {zero} ++ {succ z | z <- Z+}

In other words, the set Z+ is the set of all ordinals obtained by applying the
succ function to zero any number of times. Of course, the set Z+ is closed
under the succ function.

It is worth noting that the set Z+ is itself an ordinal, and is usually denoted
as omega. However, we don't plan on getting too crazy about infinities, at least
not in the context of ordinals, and are using this as merely a stepping stone
to begin talking about the natural numbers into the rationals into the reals.

A quick note on type definitions, the astute reader will notice that Ordinals
and Integers have the same type alias. This is true, because in this formulation,
everything is a set, so of course they are both sets. The type definitions are
only used as a indicator to the reader of what kinds of sets are meant to be
used for a function, and doesn't actually restrict anything about the types
being used.

I want to talk about modulo sets here, because it seems like it will be useful,
and here is as good a place as any.

A modulo is simply the set of all elements of an ordinal. However, we can talk
of things like addition modulo n and multiplication modulo n using elements
of Z+ that are not in modulo n.

Let's define

    Type Modulo = Z1 -> {{}}
    modulo = vonNeumann

which creates a whole family of sets {modulo n | n <- Z1}. For each one of
these particular sets, we define the following operators.

    zero :: Modulo n
    coerce :: Integer -> Modulo n
    succ :: Modulo n -> Modulo n
    max :: {Modulo n} -> Modulo n
    pred :: Modulo n -> Modulo n
    (+) :: Modulo n -> Integer -> Modulo n
    (-) :: Modulo n -> Integer -> Modulo n
    (*) :: Modulo n -> Integer -> Modulo n
    sum :: {Modulo n} -> Modulo n
    prod :: {Modulo n} -> Modulo n

    zero = Null
    coerce x = if x @ modulo n then x else coerce (x - n)
    succ m = if next == n then Null else next where next = m ++ insert m Null
    max = union
    pred m = if m == Null then max $ modulo n else max m
    (+) m Null = m
    (+) m i = succ m + pred i
    (-) m Null = m
    (-) m i = pred m - pred i
    (*) m Null = Null
    (*) m i = m + m * pred i
    sum = fold (+) Null
    prod = fold (*) {Null}

Note that I am being pretty abusive with my usage of n, what I really mean
is zero :: n -> Modulo and zero _ = Null, but I can't be concerned with
writing n -> before all my function types.

The most interesting thing to note is, we now have a definition of - that is
closed under the set, unlike our integers, and that pred Null is not Null and
pred is also closed under the modulo set.

I would also like to mention some sets derived from Z+. There are times when
we want to allow a function to take as input any non zero member of Z+, and
I would like to come up with a shorthand for it besides Z+ -- {Null}. Thus,
we say

    Zn :: Integer -> {Integer}
    Zn n = Z+ -- {n}

Instead of saying x <- Zn 3, we will just say x <- Z3 as shorthand.


At this juncture, we have defined the natural numbers, and the modulo numbers
and the next step in the process would be to work to define the rational numbers.
However, before we can do that, we must define an ordered pair.
We decide to use Kuratowski's definition.

    Kuratowski :: ({}, {}) -> {}
    Kuratowski (a, b) = {{a}, {a, b}}

Next, we have to define functions for extracting element from a pair. These
are defined as

    fst :: {} -> {}
    snd :: {} -> {}

    fst = intersect
    snd a = a -- fst a

One can verify such things as fst $ Kuratowski (a, b) = a and
snd $ Kuratowski (a, b) = b. I am honestly not sure if I got this right, but
regardless we can just say that we know there is a way to encode ordered pairs
inside of sets.

Now that we have that out of the way, we can begin to talk about the rationals.
The set Q+ is defined as follows.

    type Rational = {{}}
    Q+ :: {Rational}
    Q+ = {Kuratowski (a, b) | a <- Z+, b <- Z1}

In other words, every rational can be stated as a kuratowski pair of integers,
where the second in the pair is non-zero.

There are many things to talk about, so I'm just going to start talking about
them without regard to the order in which I do. The first thing is to notice
that we have simply created a set of Kuratowski pairs, and until we define a
notion of equality in Q, (2,4) != (4,8), i.e. Kuratowski (2,4) is a different
set than Kuratowski (4,8).

Another thing to note is that we have lost the notion of our original Z+.
That is 3 as an element of Z+ is a different than 3 as an element of Q+.
In other terms, vonNeumann 3 is not equal to Kuratowski (3, 1).
In fact, as stated by our first point, there are many different representations
of 3 in Q+, Kuratowski (3,1) being the most obvious but Kuratowski (6,2) and
Kuratowski (9,3) being equally as valid. This becomes even more troubling when
we realize that, speaking in terms of natural numbers (3, 3) = {{3},{3,3}} =
{{3}} = VonNeumann 4 -- VonNeumann 3, which is not at all like 1 or anything
else we might expect. In this way, we have to think of Z+ and Q+ as unrelated
sets, and speak of a member of Z+ being equal to a member of Q+ only in terms
of defined relations and not in terms of set equality. This is one of the
biggest dissapointments about the purity of the formulation of numbers using sets
in this way.

So enough on that, lets start defining some relations on Q+. For many of the
relations, we will be using our definitions defined on Z+, so its important
for the reader to understand that + sometimes means + over Integers and sometimes
means + over Rationals, and keep them straight themselves, because I
am not excited about the idea of littering my definitions throughout with
type annotations. Also, from here on, (a,b) and a/b and Kuratowski (a,b) all mean
Kuratowski (a,b)

    num :: Rational -> Integer
    den :: Rational -> Integer
    zero :: Rational
    (+) :: Rational -> Rational -> Rational
    (*) :: Rational -> Rational -> Rational
    (==) :: Rational -> Rational -> Bool
    (<=) :: Rational -> Rational -> Bool
    (===) :: Rational -> Rational -> Bool

    num = fst
    den = snd
    zero = Kuratowski (0, 1)
    (+) a b = Kuratowski (num a * den b + num b * den a, den a * den b)
    (*) a b = Kuratowski (num a * num b, den a * den b)
    (==) a b = num a * den b == num b * den a
    (<=) a b = num a * den b <= num b * den a
    (===) a b = num a == num b && den a == den b


Next, we want a way to embed the elements of Z+ into Q+, so we define

    embed :: Integer -> Rational
    embed a = Kuratowski (a, {Null})

Note that I used {Null} here, but I could have just as easily used vonNeumann 1,
and it would have been a small mistake to say Kuratowski (a, 1) because 1 isn't
a set in our context but some built in encoding of the integers.

From this point, one can prove all of the facts about Z+ about embed <$> Z+
and see that all the properties we'd expect to hold about succ and + and *
and so forth hold as we'd expect them to. It's also worth noting that
embed <$> Z+ = {Kuratowski (z, {Null}) | z <- Z+}, as one tell very straigtforwardly
from monadic properties. This set embed <$> Z+ is clearly different from Z+,
and is a strict subset of Q+, and we shall call it the integral rationals.
We shouldn't need to reason about it, but in case it ever comes up, that will
be the name we use.

At this point, it is very worth noting that, although we haven't talked about
the notions of countablitity, the set of rationals is countable. It is easy to
show that there is a one-to-one mapping from the integers to the rationals (embed is one
such mapping) but less trivial to show that there is a one-to-one mapping from the rationals
to the integers. If we define

    f :: Rational -> Integer
    f = (\q -> vonNeumann 2 ^ num q * vonNeumann 3 ^ den q)

and we can show both that

    q == p <-> f q == f p
    {f q | q <- Q+} is a subset of Z+

then we have our proof. I leave a proof of this to the reader,
allowing him to employ whatever level of rigor he sees fit. (I personally prefer
to think about it really hard until the answer seems trivial to me, which has
all the rigor of a wet noodle)

At this point, it seems fitting to begin to speak of prime numbers. The set
of all prime numbers Primes is defined by

    isComposite :: Integer -> Bool
    isPrime :: Integer -> Bool
    Primes :: {Integer}

    isComposite p = p @ {a * b | a <- Z2, b <- Z2}
    isPrime p = and $ zipWith (\a b -> not $ a * b == p) Z2 Z2
    Primes = {isPrime p | p <- Z+}

In order to accomadate the notion of computability, we will make a small
tweak to isPrime, since we know there is no a > p where a * b = p and
also define nextPrime.

    isPrime p = and $ zipWith (\a b -> not $ a * b == p) s s where
        s = (p -- {Null, {Null}})
    nextPrime :: Integer -> Integer
    nextPrime p = if isPrime $ succ p then succ p else nextPrime (succ p)

These definitions allow us to define functions recursively whereas before
we would be restricted to infinite sets.

Now that we have primes and composites, we can begin to speak of the
fundamental theorem of arithmatic.

Before we get into the fundamental theorem, though, I want to talk about lists.
If a set is totally ordered, we can convert it to a list. In mathematical terms

    toList :: Ord a => {a} -> [a]
    toList = ...
    toSet :: [a] -> {a}
    toSet = fold insert Null

I'm not concerned with the implementation of converting a set to a list, I am
only concerned with the fact that, given a total ordering, it can be done.

Without further ado, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmatic

    Fundamental Theorem of Arithmatic
        There is a charactiscic function

        char :: Z1 -> [Integer]

        where any number x strictly greater than zero has the properties that

        x == prod $ zipWith (^) (toList Primes) (char x)
        x == y <-> char x == char y

        Intuitively, proving the first proposition shows the existance of a list,
        and proving the second proposition show uniqueness of the list.

I don't feel like proving this theorem, but I will say that it involves defining
the characteristic first, which is what I will now attempt to do. Before we
get into formal definitions, I want to talk about what this list looks like
intuitively speaking. The fundamental theorem of arithmatic says that any
number can be represented as a unique product of primes. The characteristic of
a number is the list of all the exponents of the primes in this product.
So for instance, 84 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 7, toList Primes looks like [2,3,5,7,11,...]
and char 84 looks like [2,1,0,1,0,0,0,...], and the fundamental theorem says
that 84 = 2^2 * 3^1 * 5^0 * 7^1 * 11^0 * ... so if one imagines placing char x
literally over toList Primes, one has an intuitive understanding of what char x
represents. Enough of that, lets work on defining char x

We say a divdes b if there is some integer c such that b == a * c.
This means b is a multiple of a, e.g. div a b <-> multiple b a.
It is worth noting that div a a = True and mult a a = True

    div :: Integer -> Integer -> Bool
    divisors :: Integer -> {Integer}
    gcd :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
    multiple :: Integer -> Integer -> Bool
    multiples :: Integer -> {Integer}
    lcm :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer

    div a b = not . (== Null) $ {c <- Integer | b == a * c}
    divisors a = {d <- Integer | div d a}
    gcd a b = max $ divisors a ^^ divisors b
    multiple a b = not . (== Null) $ {c <- Integer | a == b * c}
    multiples a = {m <- Integer | multiple m a}
    lcm a b = min $ multiples a ^^ multiples b

I would also like to define integer division

    (/) :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
    (/) a b = union {c <- Integer | a == b * c}

Note that we have defined this in such a way that if b does not divide a then
we get Null, and if b does divide a then we get the result we would expect.
Also a / Null is Null and Null / b is Null, although they are both null for
different reasons. In the 1/0 case, it is null because the union of the null
set is the null set, and in the 0/1 case it is null because the union of the
set containing only null is null.

Note that if we are concerned with computability, we can define divisors in
terms of all numbers less or equal to a, and lcm can be defined in terms
of characteristics, since the characteristic definition does not rely on lcm.

We say that a divides b n times if a^n divides b. The divDegree of two numbers
is thus defined as

    divDegree :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
    divDegree a b = max {n <- Integer | div (a^n) b}

Again, if we are concerned with computability, we could define
divDegree equivilently as

    divDegree a = go Null a where
        go acc a' b' =
            if div a' b'
            then go (succ acc) (a' * a) b
            else acc

We easily have the property

    div = (> 0) . divDegree

We are now equipped to define the charactistic.

    char :: Z1 -> [Integer]
    char = divDegree <$> toList Primes

It is left to the reader to show that this characteristic satisfies the fundamental
theorem of arithmatic. Let it also be known that char could be redefined as
a computable function if we were to define this recursively like so.

    char = go $ VonNeumann 2 where
        go _ {Null} = repeat Null
        go p x = n : go (nextPrime p) (x / p^n) where
            n = divDegree p x

The inverse of the characteristic is

    dechar :: [Integer] -> Integer
    dechar = prod $ zipWith (^) (toList Primes)

and again this could be defined as the computable function, but I don't feel
like writing it down but the reader is of course encouraged to.
Also, one can see that char . dechar = id and vice versa.  Convincing yourself
of this is again left to the reader.

Another interesting feature that we will use is that

    char $ gcd a b == zipWith min (char a) (char b)
    char $ lcm a b == zipWith max (char a) (char b)

This property gives a good mental picture of what a gcd and lcm looks like.
Again, these properties are left to the reader to prove however rigorously.

Now that we've talked about a characteristic list of an integer, we would
like to be able to talk about the characteristic form of a rational. That
is, the set Q+ forms a family of equivilence classes, and for any arbitrary
rational number in a particular equivilence class, we want to come up with
a characteristic member of that equivilence class. In mathematical terms,
what we want is a function where this holds.

    a == b -> char a === char b

In this way, we can talk about the subset of the rational numbers
char <$> Q+ and reason about it as we desire.

It turns out we can define the characteristic of a rational based upon the
characteristics of its numerator and denominator. Again, we must be careful
not to mix up the definition of char, because I am not going to
litter this elegence with arbitrary naming decisions or type annotations,
so let it be clear that (char a) refers to the integer definition
of char when a is an integer, and the rational definition when a is a rational.

    char :: Rational -> Rational
    char (a, b) = Kuratowski (n, d) where
        n = dechar $ zipWith (-) (char a) (char $ gcd a b)
        d = dechar $ zipWith (-) (char b) (char $ gcd a b)

In order to show that this definition is adequete, we need to show that

    char q == q
    a == b <-> char a === char b

Which are both excersizes left to the reader to prove with as much rigor as desired.

Also note that we could define char recursively, and as such this char is
also computable. A recursive definition is left as an exercise for the reader.

I will note at this point that these rules for the characteristic function
don't garuntee that the characteristic of q is its most reduced form. The way
we explicitly defined charcateristic just so happens to, which is what we would
like, but we could define a characteristic that always has denominator > 1 if
we chose, and it would obey the laws listed above. I don't know what use such
a characteristic would bring us, but its there. The rules defined above
are a more general principle of any characteristic of an equivilence class.

Another note about our definition, is that we don't actually need to abuse
our peculiar properties of (-) as we defined it for integers, because it
will always be the case that any element in char a will be greater than
that element in char $ gcd a b. It is not trivial to prove this, but it is
plain to see by intuition, so given that we've defined everything with some
consistency and sanity up to this point (of which the odds of I'd say are low,
but we can pretend like we have), then its plain to see that we don't have abuse
the quirk that Null - a = Null.

Now, it is appropiate to talk of the density of the rational numbers. We will
say that rational numbers are dense if for any q and p where q < p there exists
an m such that q < m < p. The easist way to show this is by construction.

    mean :: Rational -> Rational -> Rational
    mean q p = Kuratowski
        ( num q * den p + num p * den q
        , den q * den p * VonNeumann 2 )

And it is an exercise of the reader to show that

    q < p => q < mean q p ^ mean q p < p

Enough dicking around, lets talk about reals.

Before we begin typing definitions, lets talk through some intuition about
how this needs to be done. We are going to use dedekind cuts to define the
reals, which means that every real number will be a set of rational numbers A
where A has at least 1 element, and for every element in A, there is another
element in A which is greater than A, i.e. A has no supremum in A.

Before that, I want to clarify a point about sets and types. Along the way,
we could have been defining functions such as isInteger and isRational and
define them such that.

    isInteger :: {} -> Bool
    isInteger = (@ Z+)

Instead, we've just been waving our hands a bit by assigning Integers to dummy
types and defining our functions in terms of those types, or even by abusing
set notation and defining types in terms a specific implentation of a set, such as Z1.
I just want to be clear again that we are talking about sets of sets here, and
there is no "unit" or "root" type, before we move on.

I suppose the first thing to do then is define a supremum.

    supremum :: Ord {{}} => {{}}
    supremum ss = min {x | s <- ss, x >= s}

One way to think about this type definition is, given some ordering of Sets,
the supremum of a set is given by the definition above. Ord {{}} could be
thought of as another argument of supremum.

When we talk of supremums, a supremum of a set is also a set. We say a set S
is closed under supremum if every member of S has a supremum in S. That is

    closed :: {} -> Bool
    closed S = and $ {supremum s @ S | s <- S}

The integers are closed under supremum, because for any subset S of Z+, it
is possible to show that supremum = max, and thus that max S is the supremum
of S, which we know is an integer. However, this does not hold true for the rationals.
One has to remember that inequality is defined differently for rationals than
for integers, so while max of a subset S of Q+ does indeed yield a value,
it is not generally the case that this value is the supremum of S.
In fact, there exists a set of rationals whose supremum is not a rational.
The canonical example of this is the set {q <- Q+ | q * q < Kuratowski (2,1)}
It is not trivial to show that the supremum of s is not a rational, but that
is indeed the case.



    type Real = {{}}
    R+ :: Real

We would like to embed the rational into the reals. We do that with the embed
function, inserting the usual disclaimer about making sure that types match.

    embed :: Rational -> Real
    embed q = {p <- Rational | p < q}

And some functions over reals. Again, insert the disclaimer about how
(+) could mean integer + or rational + or now real + depending on the
context, and we leave it to the reader to keep his wits about him in
deciphering exactly whats going on.

    zero :: Real
    (+) :: Real -> Real -> Real

    zero = Null
    (+) a b = liftA2 (+) a b
