    A Long Expected Party

    When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly be
    celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party of special
    magnifeicence, there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton

Bilbo was a queer old hobbit, rich and peculiar, being the star of the tale
known in the land of Middle Earth as There and Back Again, and more commonly
known as The Hobbit to those of us not under the spell of Tolkenese; Bilbo
spent his days mostly just being really rich and kinda bein a dick to everyone
else in Hobbiton. Not a huge dick, but a little bit of a dick.

And it turns out that Bilbo had all sorts of relatives, and he took a great
fondness to Frodo, his Nephew and Second Nephew on either side of his family.
Which is weird but don't think about it and we'll all be better off. Basically
an aunt fucked a nephew but across family where no blood is shared, and Frodo
is the child that resulted and Bilbo is the brother of Drogo who did the deed.

In fact, all of these rumors and gossip is the spread of the town in the Shire,
much like it would be in the queer and cozy hills of England whence Tolkein
himself grew up. Not the least of the gossip goes to Ham Gamgee, also known as
the Gaffer or Master Hamfast affectionately. He goes on talking about this and
that about Bilbo or Drogo or Bilbo's Aunt and Frodo's mother Primuala
Brandybuck, of whom we will later discover Merry is related too in some way.

And of course, Gandalf comes in driving his wagon, bringing fireworks for all
of the Hobbits of the Shire to look on and behold, for alas, Bilbo is having
his Eleventee-tooth birthday, or whatever 111 is in hobbit garble, and Gandalf
is providing the arrangements.

Of course, Gandalf being a great wizard and one of the spirits of the Ainur
from the First age does not need concern himself with the birthdays of hobbits,
but in this particular hobbit, he has a keen interest, as Gandalf only but
begins to suspect that the ring Bilbo bears is more than it seems.

But alas, Bilbo goes through with his party, and we meet all kinds of Tooks and
Brandybucks and old Foot people, and all sorts of queer hobbit folk, and Bilbo
begins to speak

    I don't know half of you half as well as I should like: and I like less
    than half of you half as well as you deserve.

And when Bilbo is done with his speech a great flash is seen and he
dissappears.

Well, of course this is an alarm to everyone in attendance, save Frodo who
knows of the magic ring, but everyone else finds this sort of joke in poor
taste and are left to wonder what got into queer old but somehow still young
Bilbo.

For that is what Bilbo and Gandalf discussed, his disappearance, and Gandalf of
course finds Bilbo in his office gathering his things to leave. And as Gandalf
inquires about Bilbo's magic ring, Bilbo continues to make new excuses why it
should not be left to Frodo

    'It is mine, I tell you. My own. My precious. Yes, my precious.'

To which Gandalf of course reminds Bilbo of Gollum and Bilbo begrudgingly but
of his own power leaves the ring in an envelope to Frodo.

    The Road goes ever on and on
    Down from the door where it began
    Now far ahead the Road has gone,
    And I must follow, if I can,
    Pursuing it with eager feet,
    Until it joins some larger way
    Where many paths and errands meet
    And whither then? I cannot say.

Frodo then comes to Bag End to find Gandalf sitting and smoking. Gandalf
ensures the safe delivery of the ring to Frodo.

As the new inheritor of Bag End, Frodo felt obligated to do his party duties,
as it was his birthday as much as it was Bilbo's, and he made thank you notes
and thank you gifts and we get to learn about all sorts of hobbits that we
absolutely do not give any shits about.

Of course, the Sackville-Bagginses, of whom Merry is indirectly related, are
bitter at Frodo's acquisition of the house on the hill, and resolve to be
bitter for not acquring what is not rightfully theirs any more than it is
Frodo's.

And Gandalf warns Frodo before taking leave that the Magic Ring should not be
toyed with, and even should avoid being worn unless absolutely neccessary. And
Gandalf spoke in response to Frodo wondering if they might see Bilbo again.

    'So do I.' said Gandalf 'and I wonder many other things. Good-bye now! Take
    care of yourself! Look out for me, especially at unlikely times! Good-bye!'

And with that Gandalf scurries off hurriedly and does not return to the Shire
for a very long time.
