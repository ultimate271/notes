In the beginning there was a void. It was not the Void, or The Void, but
instead simply "a void", the only one of its kind, always being nothing and
never being something.

Others have names for this phenemenon, or concept, that vary from religous to
scientific to agnostic to everything that you could perceive in between. Space
is given the name of all things outside the realm of human existance, or any
existance at all, but instead that space where something may reside, but
currently nothing is.

Another name given to this void in eastern culture is the Dao, or the Tao, the
Way, and the juxtuposition of the Yin and the Yang, merged together as One Way,
The Way, the way that is always straight yet ever turning. For in this Eastern
Culture, the Dao is given as the thing that existed before things existed.

In Middle Eastern culture, you have God, Yaweh, the Eternal, the Holy Trinity,
Allah, the Father, and many other names given to this thing that existed before
existance meant anything. However, this God or Father is the same to the Dao in
many ways, of which the one namely that they are both concepts that have the
claim to being more fundamental than the concepts of Space and Vacuum and
Nothingness. They both require intuition in understanding, as they each have
their own difficulties in grasping the various concepts that their respective
works, the Dao Te Ching or the Bible, the Old Testament, the Holy Book, and
many others.

However, in one key way does the Dao exist in a different way than God or
Allah. For the people that advocate for a model of life stem around a Central
figure, usually capitalized as such, would have the people who subscribe to
their philosophy make patently absurd claims like 'there is a God who is above
all else' or 'Jesus was a human being that died for over 48 hours and rose back
from the dead.' Claims like this only serve to hurt the true message of Jesus,
which is that of a mythology, the Son of God who comes down to Earth to
sacrifice himself for the sake of Original Sin as commited by Adam Son of God
and his wife Eve, the first lady of all that lives in the void.

For alas, I stray from the concept of the void. The dao is much mor like the
void than God is, for God created something out of the nothingness that is the
void, while the Dao did and does no such thing. The dao is not a "God", it is
just simply an intuition that seems to apply to a great many things in life,
and in its union creates a beautiful and wonderfully disconcordant harmony.

There is also the view of Tolkien, in the Silmilarrion, he makes the claim that
all of things in Middle Earth began with the music of Spirits, or Auiun, and
that there was nothing but the music of these spirits, not even the sense of
sound, but instead of only the great ebbs and flows of the soul that one might
feel when getting really stoned and listening to Pink Floyd's iconic 'Dark Side
of the Moon' (These are of course my words and not Tolkeins, but I would hope
he would find my sense of humor at least helpful in describing the beginning of
his world of Arda).

Regardless of Tolkein though, there is this always present concept of a void,
and what I like to do is instead of understanding where the void leads at an
academic level, I beleive it is important to live your life in a way where you
can expect a certain level of knowing what the face of death looks like. In
doing that, in understanding that all things came from somewhere, and that all
things will come to pass, one has the sense that you can begin to see yourself
in the view point of one little ape in the vast world of 7 billion and rising
we have today.

Also, if we are going to be completely honest right now, I am high as fuck, so
please take everything I have written so far with that grain of salt.

Before we continue with the free writing, I just want to say one thing. I think
I'm mostly done. I openly wept reading the very last chapter of Book 6 of the
Lord of the Rings, and the Return of the King

    For alas, even in the beginning was the void not empty
    And it is in this lack of emptiness that something must come.
    But what is this lack of emptiness? Some may
    Call it God, Our Lord, but that would not be entirely accurate,
    As God was born after this. But no, this is the Way, the Tao,
    This fusion of Yin and Yang is the birth of all life,
    For in that all but the most rare are like this Tao.
    Yes, it is in this Tao that the Void was made Full.

And out of the void came first the Yang, to find order in that which does not
exist. As the Yang sought to find Order, so the Yin was needed to guide the
Yang, and create Chaos for him. For in this beautiful chaos, a sort of return
to the other side of nothingness that everyone will come to know, only in that
can we find order in this universe. For there was no Order in the Void, only
Emptiness, and neither was there Chaos. But in these things, Order and Chaos,
Yang and Yin, Black and White, Male and Female, the thing underlying all these
things, their fusion began to create magnificient ideas.

And thus in the beginning of days when most everything was just a void, Yang
and Yin began to dance, their playful dance, as if two fairies had resolved to
live eternal lives believing each in their own isolation unaware of the others
existance, only to find your companion and soulmate but by coincidence, or
chance, but a chance that is always meant to happen, and in this way, Yang and
Yin held hand in spirtual hand so they may dance through the void and create in
it both Order and Chaos.

One first must generate Chaos to have Order, and thus Entropy was born, a
fundamental feature of the fusion of Yin and Yang, for the Yin cannot exist
without the Yang, and in this way the Yang can never best the Yin, and forever
is the universe moving towards the Asymptote of Entropy, a great plain on which
all things ebb and sway through the river of the universe always in the
direction of the Yin, but never in exclusion to the Yang, for indeed it is the
Yang which enables the Yin.

And on this Asymptote of Entropy the Yang and Yin both danced, together,
exploring how they might balance themselves on the line of Entropy and create
wonderful and beautiful things. At first they could only create tiny charges,
particles in space, but they never knew where they might be at a given moment.
In this way, particles were born, but not as a projectile, and not as an
energy, but of something different, an unknown quantity, unknown even to the
Yin and Yang that birthed it.

Alas, though, whilst balanced on the line of Entropy, these unknowns become
less interesting and more known, for in a Multiverse of existance, a suitable
ammount of randomness will always converge in some way and with whatever
amouunt of strength on the Yin and the Yang, the Dao, the One Way that flows
through all of life, and those things that do not converge but instead diverge
are not the bother of such worthy and majestic being of spiritual non-energy
such as the Yin and the Yang.

And so the Yin, in unison with the Yang, gave birth to many things, all of the
things that give life, for in every living and non-living thing exhibits a life
born out of Yin, with an eternal lust for Yang, and it is in this lust of the
Yang the the Asypmtote of Entropy sways ever steeper into the depths of Chaos.

For indeed, the assypmtote of symetry began flat, holding the essence of life
as but grains of sand, and as the sand began to shift and mold and become the
mode of life as seen by both being and non-being in all of the times that ever
have been and ever will be, this shifting of sand began to shift the very
Assymptote of Entropy itself, and in this way a Order, at one end of the
Asypmtote, and Chaos at the other. It is in this way that all things may flow
from Order to Chaos.
