In the beginning there was a void. It was not the Void, or The Void, but
instead simply "a void", the only one of its kind, always being nothing
and never being something.

Others have names for this phenemenon, or concept, that vary from
religous to scientific to agnostic to everything that you could perceive
in between. Space is given the name of all things outside the realm of
human existance, or any existance at all, but instead that space where
something may reside, but currently nothing is.

Another name given to this void in eastern culture is the Dao, or the
Tao, the Way, and the juxtuposition of the Yin and the Yang, merged
together as One Way, The Way, the way that is always straight yet ever
turning. For in this Eastern Culture, the Dao is given as the thing that
existed before things existed.

In Middle Eastern culture, you have God, Yaweh, the Eternal, the Holy
Trinity, Allah, the Father, and many other names given to this thing
that existed before existance meant anything. However, this God or
Father is the same to the Dao in many ways, of which the one namely that
they are both concepts that have the claim to being more fundamental
than the concepts of Space and Vacuum and Nothingness. They both require
intuition in understanding, as they each have their own difficulties in
grasping the various concepts that their respective works, the Dao Te
Ching or the Bible, the Old Testament, the Holy Book, and many others.

However, in one key way does the Dao exist in a different way than God
or Allah. For the people that advocate for a model of life stem around a
Central figure, usually capitalized as such, would have the people who
subscribe to their philosophy make patently absurd claims like 'there is
a God who is above all else' or 'Jesus was a human being that died for
over 48 hours and rose back from the dead.' Claims like this only serve
to hurt the true message of Jesus, which is that of a mythology, the Son
of God who comes down to Earth to sacrifice himself for the sake of
Original Sin as commited by Adam Son of God and his wife Eve, the first
lady of all that lives in the void.

For alas, I stray from the concept of the void. The dao is much mor like
the void than God is, for God created something out of the nothingness
that is the void, while the Dao did and does no such thing. The dao is
not a "God", it is just simply an intuition that seems to apply to a
great many things in life, and in its union creates a beautiful and
wonderfully disconcordant harmony.

There is also the view of Tolkien, in the Silmilarrion, he makes the
claim that all of things in Middle Earth began with the music of
Spirits, or Auiun, and that there was nothing but the music of these
spirits, not even the sense of sound, but instead of only the great ebbs
and flows of the soul that one might feel when getting really stoned and
listening to Pink Floyd's iconic 'Dark Side of the Moon' (These are of
course my words and not Tolkeins, but I would hope he would find my
sense of humor at least helpful in describing the beginning of his world
of Arda).

Regardless of Tolkein though, there is this always present concept of a
void, and what I like to do is instead of understanding where the void
leads at an academic level, I beleive it is important to live your life
in a way where you can expect a certain level of knowing what the face
of death looks like. In doing that, in understanding that all things
came from somewhere, and that all things will come to pass, one has the
sense that you can begin to see yourself in the view point of one little
ape in the vast world of 7 billion and rising we have today.

Also, if we are going to be completely honest right now, I am high as
fuck, so please take everything I have written so far with that grain of
salt.

Before we continue with the free writing, I just want to say one thing.
I think I'm mostly done. I openly wept reading the very last chapter of
Book 6 of the Lord of the Rings, and the Return of the King

--

    For alas, even in the beginning was the void not empty And it is in
    this lack of emptiness that something must come.  But what is this
    lack of emptiness? Some may Call it God, Our Lord, but that would
    not be entirely accurate, As God was born after this. But no, this
    is the Way, the Tao, This fusion of Yin and Yang is the birth of all
    life, For in that all but the most rare are like this Tao.  Yes, it
    is in this Tao that the Void was made Full.

And out of the void came first the Yang, to find order in that which
does not exist. As the Yang sought to find Order, so the Yin was needed
to guide the Yang, and create Chaos for him. For in this beautiful
chaos, a sort of return to the other side of nothingness that everyone
will come to know, only in that can we find order in this universe. For
there was no Order in the Void, only Emptiness, and neither was there
Chaos. But in these things, Order and Chaos, Yang and Yin, Black and
White, Male and Female, the thing underlying all these things, their
fusion began to create magnificient ideas.

And thus in the beginning of days when most everything was just a void,
Yang and Yin began to dance, their playful dance, as if two fairies had
resolved to live eternal lives believing each in their own isolation
unaware of the others existance, only to find your companion and
soulmate but by coincidence, or chance, but a chance that is always
meant to happen, and in this way, Yang and Yin held hand in spirtual
hand so they may dance through the void and create in it both Order and
Chaos.

One first must generate Chaos to have Order, and thus Entropy was born,
a fundamental feature of the fusion of Yin and Yang, for the Yin cannot
exist without the Yang, and in this way the Yang can never best the Yin,
and forever is the universe moving towards the Asymptote of Entropy, a
great plain on which all things ebb and sway through the river of the
universe always in the direction of the Yin, but never in exclusion to
the Yang, for indeed it is the Yang which enables the Yin.

And on this Asymptote of Entropy the Yang and Yin both danced, together,
exploring how they might balance themselves on the line of Entropy and
create wonderful and beautiful things. At first they could only create
tiny charges, particles in space, but they never knew where they might
be at a given moment.  In this way, particles were born, but not as a
projectile, and not as an energy, but of something different, an unknown
quantity, unknown even to the Yin and Yang that birthed it.

Alas, though, whilst balanced on the line of Entropy, these unknowns
become less interesting and more known, for in a Multiverse of
existance, a suitable ammount of randomness will always converge in some
way and with whatever amouunt of strength on the Yin and the Yang, the
Dao, the One Way that flows through all of life, and those things that
do not converge but instead diverge are not the bother of such worthy
and majestic being of spiritual non-energy such as the Yin and the Yang.

And so the Yin, in unison with the Yang, gave birth to many things, all
of the things that give life, for in every living and non-living thing
exhibits a life born out of Yin, with an eternal lust for Yang, and it
is in this lust of the Yang the the Asypmtote of Entropy sways ever
steeper into the depths of Chaos.

For indeed, the assypmtote of symetry began flat, holding the essence of
life as but grains of sand, and as the sand began to shift and mold and
become the mode of life as seen by both being and non-being in all of
the times that ever have been and ever will be, this shifting of sand
began to shift the very Assymptote of Entropy itself, and in this way a
Order, at one end of the Asypmtote, and Chaos at the other. It is in
this way that all things may flow from Order to Chaos.

Indeed, there is no true beginning before the dawn of time in the place
that the Humans name the Universe, for time had no dawn and will
continue to tick forever on towards the future just as much as it ticked
forever on in the past.  In this way, the beginning of all things known
to Man does not exist, but instead only converges to a point that can
only be derived in a conceptual nature. It is this point, the point that
is fundamentally non-existant, that can be called the beginning of time.

And in the beginning of time, there was naught but a void. This void has
many names in human tounge: Nothingness, Space, Emptiness; but whatever
the name, the defining characteristic is lack of anything, conceptual or
physical, as such can only exist in the beginning of that which has no
beginning. Neither Suffering nor Lovingness can exist in such a place,
as each of those must take root in the Real, but instead only the deaf
sound of a vacuum or the blind sight of the eternal darkness could be
seen or heard.

But it is not so that at any time the Universe could be found in such a
state, for only by venturing indefinetly to the past can one find the
Universe closely resembling this void. But always in time there has been
the Aether, working in harmony with the void, and creating in it all of
the facinating things that Man would come to know as Reality.

However, Man, in their infinite lust for Knowledge and Power, would
attempt to describe this reality and discover a Theory of Everything,
giving laws describing all of Nature and its Being. But in this quest
Man is foolhardy, as he ever is, as such a Theory cannot be described
within the context of the Universe containing it, and as such Man is
always doomed (or gifted) to strive forever closer to a Theory which
will never be quite exactly what can be contained in Everything.

But while the Aether fundamentally cannot be described with itself, it
can still be understood as the creator of Chaos, from which particles
and energies were formed. And out of this dance of Mathematics these
particles formed groups, and these groups formed bonds, and the bonds
would collide with other bonds and transform and mold those bonds into
new and strange configurations, in each way always being somehow
different than the last, but always following a pattern, given by the
Theory of Everything that does not exist, and in this pattern Galaxies
began to form. First plasmas, then stars and gases, and finally after a
great history of particles and energies that no man can ever hope to
begin to tell in any of its profound glory, planets and living organisms
as we see them today.

For the Aether will seek to create Chaos, and the Void will seek to
create Order, and such Chaos was born in the void and Order was born in
the Aether, as the Aether and the Void are but two names for same thing,
a coin that bears two sides that are forever linked in all the past that
ever has been and all the future that ever will be.

And to the Angels and Eternal beings of the Heavens this Aether was
named Pandemonium, for in this dual the Aether was all that there could
be in their pardoxical beginning, and the Eternal Peace accompanied the
Pandemonium and in such a way created Order out of that which has no
Order, just as the Aether flowed through the Void of the Universe of Man
and created Chaos in that which has no Chaos. And all of the properties
of Nothingness for the Void in the Realm of Man applied just as well to
Pandemonium of the beginning of the Realm of Angels, for in any
paradoxical beginning the only thing that can be is Nothing, and it
cannot be the case that Something is allowed to be.

In this way, Duality is born, existing in both the Realm of Man and the
Kingdom of God. Duality would go by many names, but to those in the
Realm of Man who professed the Kingdom of God, they would call it the
Holy Spirit, that flows through all things and carries out the will of
God. But many other names this has been given, and in the land of the
Angels this Holy Spirit was simply called the Dao, which translates to
The Way in human tongue.

And so in the Realm of Man the Void would dance with the Aether and
create all of the myriad of things, dooming Humanity to Chaos and
Disorder through the passage of time; and likewise, in the Realm of the
Angels Pandemonium would be wed with the Void, the void being called
Paradiso in Angelic tongue, meaning Eternal Peace, and in so doing would
create through destruction, as a mold creates a statue, Spirituality, as
this Realm of the Angels is called by the tongue of its peoples.

And through the lens of Duality, ever present in each of these Realms,
is one of the Universe able to glimpse into the Realm of the Angels just
as a being of Spirituality is able to peer into the Realm of Man. For
duality not only is created within each realm, but across it as well,
and in this way is able to create Symmetry at their intersection. Alas,
if Duality is to be fundamental to all beings living in either Realm of
all the Cosmos, Duality itself must have a Dual, and so Symmetry is made
across the Universe and the Spirituality. For in the Cosmos, Symmetry
and Duality are the Yin and the Yang that bind the Realm of the Living
and the Realm of the Eternal.

So right now I want to talk to everyone about fiction. Not fiction per
se but actually verse. You see, both verse and prose have the qualities
that you can divide them up into sentences, each sentence containing a
complete thought. However, the difference is in verse, the tone and
articulation and speed and other such factors also play a role in this
sort of function, as what are periods but the representation of a pause
at the end of an idea, a pause that, when spoken aloud, is indeed a
physical phenomenon.

So in this way, punctuation was created to identify different levels of
pause, and of tone, and also a way of grouping words into structures to
make the verse easier and perhaps even more fair looking than a block of
words. For how should I know that that adjective goes with that
conjunctive lest I see a semi-colon showing what describes whom, and
where to block things into logical units.

And as written word became the primary mode of communication between
author and subject, (subject meaning the reader, as it were), these
punctuations begin to mean more towards the art of syntax and structure
than the art of what it sounds like when spoken aloud.

So perhaps a period doesn't mean a long pause, but instead indicates the
end of a string which should be interpreted by the parser as the thought
of a new sentance from scratch relative to the old one, and to create a
new parsing branch with which to work.

Of course, Computer Science nerd talk out of the way, all I'm really
saying is that punctuation no longer means any actual physical form,
other than that it was born out of a need to express that in written
form. Coming to accept the fact that the evolution of punctuation in
writing has its roots in spoken verse (often greek or latin), and has
since evolved to mean a grouping of thoughts and clauses in a sentence.

So I just took a huge hit of weed, and feel as though I have discovered a more
or less intuitive way to narrow down a piece. We are going to use the excerpt.
So everything in a book happens at certain points, and at those certain points,
we can create mile markers as sorts. E.G. Here begins the description of
Boromir, here ends the description of Boromir. This marker system has the
advantage that it "goes over" the text. I'm not sure the most ideal way to
store a marker. One way would be to put "Comments" througout the text. So text
inside of say underscores would be meta information placed by me about
markings.

Also, while we're at it, why am I not using xml? xml is perfect for this. Well,
sql works too, but for importing, xml all the way.

So my import might look something like this.

Let us say that the paragraph is the most atomic unit for our purposes. Every
event will happen at certain paragraphs, and we can reference them uniquely by
Novel, Book, Chapter, Section, and Paragraph numbers.

A list of events will be a list of named events, being as descriptive or not as
the author wants, each with a reference to the paragraphs where the event is
drawn from.

Not only can there be events, there can be exposition. Rowling describing the
manner in which Harry kept his hair is not an event, it's not something that
happened in the world of Hogwarts, its simply an observation about something
that was already in the world of Hogwarts.

Dialogue can be considered a part of one event (Diane and Lora discussed
matters of politics and make-up) or of one section, (Horatio replied with great
remorse to the troubled Hamlet, reminding him that his father is truely as dead
as they come).

Every event can have metadata associated with it. For instance, in Tolkien,
when Aragorn and company go through the paths of the dead, we know that it
happened on xyz date of the Tolkienian Calender, so we could include that as
part of the event where they step onto the paths, even though you can't derive
it from the text the event references.

Likewise, events can portray foreshadowing in one form or another. If this were
the case, the events will be coupled in a n to n relationship, where every
event has a list of events that reference it or are referenced by it.

Events also have characters associated with them, so for instance, the event
where Vadar reveals to Luke that he is his father has only 2 characters in it,
Vadar and Luke. If Luke references Obi-Wan, he doesn't count in the list of
primary characters, but secondary characters. The primary characters are only
those characters that are present at the time and scene of the event.

Which also requires we have a list of characters just floating about. Or items,
as you could state more abstractly.
