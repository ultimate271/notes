I had a dream last night. I dreamt I ate mushrooms, and then smoked weed with Yuri and Collin in a hotel room last night.

This is fitting, because last night, I watch from the front row Yuri's superfight.

I arrived at the venue at 4:35, and I texted Collin, "I'm outside"

We arrived in, and I saw that we had front row seats to watch the fights.

I sat there somewhat awkardly for a couple of minutes. I went and took a photo of the stage from afar.

I was expecting others to be there, and I was expecting it to be a long time before fights started. But before I knew it, we were standing up for the national anthem.

Before that, I was observing the lighting system. I was thinking about how it is all put together.

I am sure that somewhere, there is teh "lighting" guy, and this guy is responsible of controlling the lights from afar.

Of cournse, with fight to win, "Controlling teh lights" means two things.
First, it means that there was a programmer behind the scenes who took music and made a light scene out of them.
Second, it means that there was someone sitting at a console, saying "Play this track. Now Play the other one. Wait for fight.

But before the fights had even started, I noticed that the lights were on a sort of random setting.
I was curious just how random it was, but I wasn't able to focus on them for very long.

So the fights were interesting.

The first fight was between two women.
One of them pulled guard, and went for a guard submission.
The other one stood up.
She was in prime position to slam, but she didn't.
Instead, she lowered her opponent to the mat and continued the fight from there.
So I was confused, she could have gotten a really good slam off.
"Well, they are women." Chris said.
"Yeah, I guess."

The fights after that varied in intensity.
I remember one fight between two players that involved a lot of standing at eachother and posturing.
One player didn't want to engage, and the other play stood up and postured at him.

I remember another fight where one player caught the other player in worm guard, and continued to attempt triangles.
They were bullshit triangles, and there was maybe only one or two legitimate attempts, but the worm guard was really good.
I'm not sure how I feel about this.
On the one hand, it works.
On the other hand, worm guard is sorta bullshit.
So I have mixed feelings about the "genius" behind the worm guard.

One of the fights got really intense.
So it started, and one of the guys caught the other in an arm in guillitine.
Of course, arm-in guillitiens are hard to finish, so the opponent was able to withstand the choke for some time.
Eventually, the opponent stood up, and the guillitine holder let got of the gullitine and immdeiately went for a trip.
The trip landed perfectly, and the man landed on the ground with a thud.
He was still aware, for the most part, of what was around him, but he had just been put in a choke for a full minute and a half, and exerted a ton of energy to get out of it.
The man was exhausted, loopy, losing track of consciousness, and on his back.
Then, he reached for his eye.
Apparently he lost a contact, and was feeling for it with his finger.
Of course, the ref interpreted this as an eye poke, and timed out the fight.
And of course, the opponent, who had been attempting to choke his opponent for a full minute and a half, was not going to wait for him to find his contact.
But the ref stopped the fight for a solid fifteen seconds, which gave the opponent enough time to gather himself, regain some energy, and get a technical stand up out of the trip.
So now the two are back standing again, and the person who was robbed of his submission attempts by his opponent falsely pointing to his eye as if it was an eye poke was furious.
They restarted in the middle, and man pushed his oppenent.
He fell back, but gained his balance. The man was going for another trip, but the opponent had more balance this time.
Still, you could tell he was exhausted, so his opponent maintained dominant control, and went for another trip.
Again, the opponent faltered, and again, for a third time, the opponent went for a trip.
This time, when he went to the first entry part of the trip, he put a lot of emphasis on the part of the trip where you really shove your opponent.
He pushed his opponent off the stage.
Immdieattely, the ref made sure the fighter that got pushed off was okay, and then made a gesture to DQ the man who push the other.
As soon as that happened, another judge from the corner gestured to the head referee. They had a short conversation, and the fight was told to move on.
Of course, the ref had a word with the man who pushed his opponent off the stage, and they resumed, now with about 4:30 to go.
So now the fight resumes more like a traditional BJJ match. The two opponent do some takedown stuff, and they end up on the ground.
So now, the person who orginally had teh guillitine, he manages to work his way to the back of his opponent, and get in a bow and arrow.
In the process, the opponent turtles, and ends up trying to get out of the submission.
As he gets out of the sumbmission, he tries to get away from his opponent in an explosive movement to create distance.
Of course, the man with the submission held simply hold his control, and rides his oppenent while still working to tighten his submission.
The man being submitted makes two or three more explosive movements, each attempting to rid himself of a bow and arrow weilding opponent.
By his thrid hop, he had taken himself and his opponent off the stage.
I want to be clear about something here.
In the rules of fight to win, walking off the stage to get out of a submission is against the rules, and that man should have been DQ.
It was the other man who was DQ'd earlier.
That makes it all the more funny when you see the referree get a huge smile on his face as the man ran off the stage to get a submission.
So they were reset with about two minutes to go, and I believe, this time, the man in the dominant position established something tight and finished him.
It was a really intense fight.
I find it interesting bceause, at first, I was rooting for the guy who outlasted the submission for so long.
I myself love that sort of play, and wanted him to come back and win.
However, as soon as he reached for his contact, and the ref stopped the fight because he thought it was an eye poke, my opinion reversed.
The most intense part of the fight was, of course, when the man was thrown off the stage.

I have realized that I want to make clear exactly who is who in my scenario.
Person A was the winner of teh match.
Person A got a Guillitine on person B and held it for a long time.
Person B was my initial favoite, but that shifted when he reached for his eye as if it were an eye poke. There was very clearly no eye pokes.
Person A then shoved Person B off the mat.
A was almost DQ'd, but the fight was told to resume.
A gets into a dominant postion again, this time from the back, and B attempts to explode off the stage to get out of the submission.
They are reset again, and A proceeds to win the fight by some submission.

And then of course was Yuri's fight.
There's not much to say about it honestly.
Yuri fought well.
It was intense walking him get on teh stage.
He has that wrestler vibe, where he slaps himself on the had and legs extensively.
Raphael entered the stage, and did his whole walk on routine.
They fought.
Yuri got the first takedown at about 8:30
From half guard bottom, Raphael was going for some bullshit kimura just to try and score points.
Yuri was doing a good job shutting that down.
Eventually Yuri ends up getting some foot things, going for an attempt on one leg, and then teh other.
Yuri ended up on bottom, and went for some open guard play.
From there, Yuri went for another submission.
At about twenty second to go, Yuri got a sort of straight ankle lock, and really went for it.
Raphael, of course didn't tap, and taht was that.
Yuri won my unanimous decision.

It was super cool the post fight celebration. Yuri came over to our table, and had a picture with us.
I'm in taht picture.
We then hung out for some more time.
I stayed probably a bit longer than I should, but I got to actually interact with Yuri and discuss his fight.
I made the comment, "You played it super smart," and he agreed.
I also made the comment, "You were probably ahead before that ankle lock, but that sealed the deal."
Yuri compemented Collin, and thanked him for his insight into the scoring system of fight to win.
They decided to go to Cafe Brazil after. Skyler joined in with them.

I drove home and went to sleep.
That was my day yesterday.
So yeah, during my dreams, Collin had some mushrooms for Yuri for after he won the fight.
Yuri didn't want the mushrooms, and said he just wanted to go back to the hotel and smoke weed.
So I go back to the hotel with Collin and Yuri, and chill with them.
Yuri insists that he doesn't want the mushrooms, so Collin offers them to me.
I accept and eat them.
I then start to chill back, and get passed a joint from someone on the left.
I take a couple hits of it, and pass it on to Yuri.
Yuri hits it.
That was the extent of the dream.
