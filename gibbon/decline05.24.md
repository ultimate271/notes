## Chapter LII: More Conquests By The Arabs.--Part III.

In a private condition, our desires are perpetually repressed by poverty
and subordination; but the lives and labors of millions are devoted to
the service of a despotic prince, whose laws are blindly obeyed, and
whose wishes are instantly gratified. Our imagination is dazzled by the
splendid picture; and whatever may be the cool dictates of reason, there
are few among us who would obstinately refuse a trial of the comforts
and the cares of royalty. It may therefore be of some use to borrow
the experience of the same Abdalrahman, whose magnificence has perhaps
excited our admiration and envy, and to transcribe an authentic memorial
which was found in the closet of the deceased caliph. "I have now
reigned above fifty years in victory or peace; beloved by my subjects,
dreaded by my enemies, and respected by my allies. Riches and honors,
power and pleasure, have waited on my call, nor does any earthly
blessing appear to have been wanting to my felicity. In this situation,
I have diligently numbered the days of pure and genuine happiness which
have fallen to my lot: they amount to Fourteen:--O man! place not thy
confidence in this present world!" [50] The luxury of the caliphs, so
useless to their private happiness, relaxed the nerves, and terminated
the progress, of the Arabian empire. Temporal and spiritual conquest had
been the sole occupation of the first successors of Mahomet; and after
supplying themselves with the necessaries of life, the whole revenue
was scrupulously devoted to that salutary work. The Abbassides were
impoverished by the multitude of their wants, and their contempt of
oeconomy. Instead of pursuing the great object of ambition, their
leisure, their affections, the powers of their mind, were diverted by
pomp and pleasure: the rewards of valor were embezzled by women and
eunuchs, and the royal camp was encumbered by the luxury of the palace.
A similar temper was diffused among the subjects of the caliph. Their
stern enthusiasm was softened by time and prosperity. they sought riches
in the occupations of industry, fame in the pursuits of literature, and
happiness in the tranquillity of domestic life. War was no longer the
passion of the Saracens; and the increase of pay, the repetition of
donatives, were insufficient to allure the posterity of those voluntary
champions who had crowded to the standard of Abubeker and Omar for the
hopes of spoil and of paradise.

[Footnote 50: Cardonne, tom. i. p. 329, 330. This confession, the
complaints of Solomon of the vanity of this world, (read Prior's verbose
but eloquent poem,) and the happy ten days of the emperor Seghed,
(Rambler, No. 204, 205,) will be triumphantly quoted by the detractors
of human life. Their expectations are commonly immoderate, their
estimates are seldom impartial. If I may speak of myself, (the only
person of whom I can speak with certainty,) my happy hours have far
exceeded, and far exceed, the scanty numbers of the caliph of Spain; and
I shall not scruple to add, that many of them are due to the pleasing
labor of the present composition.]

Under the reign of the Ommiades, the studies of the Moslems were
confined to the interpretation of the Koran, and the eloquence and
poetry of their native tongue. A people continually exposed to the
dangers of the field must esteem the healing powers of medicine, or
rather of surgery; but the starving physicians of Arabia murmured a
complaint that exercise and temperance deprived them of the greatest
part of their practice. [51] After their civil and domestic wars, the
subjects of the Abbassides, awakening from this mental lethargy, found
leisure and felt curiosity for the acquisition of profane science. This
spirit was first encouraged by the caliph Almansor, who, besides his
knowledge of the Mahometan law, had applied himself with success to
the study of astronomy. But when the sceptre devolved to Almamon, the
seventh of the Abbassides, he completed the designs of his grandfather,
and invited the muses from their ancient seats. His ambassadors at
Constantinople, his agents in Armenia, Syria, and Egypt, collected the
volumes of Grecian science at his command they were translated by the
most skilful interpreters into the Arabic language: his subjects were
exhorted assiduously to peruse these instructive writings; and
the successor of Mahomet assisted with pleasure and modesty at the
assemblies and disputations of the learned. "He was not ignorant," says
Abulpharagius, "that they are the elect of God, his best and most useful
servants, whose lives are devoted to the improvement of their rational
faculties. The mean ambition of the Chinese or the Turks may glory in
the industry of their hands or the indulgence of their brutal appetites.
Yet these dexterous artists must view, with hopeless emulation, the
hexagons and pyramids of the cells of a beehive: [52] these
fortitudinous heroes are awed by the superior fierceness of the lions
and tigers; and in their amorous enjoyments they are much inferior to
the vigor of the grossest and most sordid quadrupeds. The teachers of
wisdom are the true luminaries and legislators of a world, which,
without their aid, would again sink in ignorance and barbarism." [53]
The zeal and curiosity of Almamon were imitated by succeeding princes of
the line of Abbas: their rivals, the Fatimites of Africa and the
Ommiades of Spain, were the patrons of the learned, as well as the
commanders of the faithful; the same royal prerogative was claimed by
their independent emirs of the provinces; and their emulation diffused
the taste and the rewards of science from Samarcand and Bochara to Fez
and Cordova. The vizier of a sultan consecrated a sum of two hundred
thousand pieces of gold to the foundation of a college at Bagdad, which
he endowed with an annual revenue of fifteen thousand dinars. The fruits
of instruction were communicated, perhaps at different times, to six
thousand disciples of every degree, from the son of the noble to that of
the mechanic: a sufficient allowance was provided for the indigent
scholars; and the merit or industry of the professors was repaid with
adequate stipends. In every city the productions of Arabic literature
were copied and collected by the curiosity of the studious and the
vanity of the rich. A private doctor refused the invitation of the
sultan of Bochara, because the carriage of his books would have required
four hundred camels. The royal library of the Fatimites consisted of one
hundred thousand manuscripts, elegantly transcribed and splendidly
bound, which were lent, without jealousy or avarice, to the students of
Cairo. Yet this collection must appear moderate, if we can believe that
the Ommiades of Spain had formed a library of six hundred thousand
volumes, forty-four of which were employed in the mere catalogue. Their
capital, Cordova, with the adjacent towns of Malaga, Almeria, and
Murcia, had given birth to more than three hundred writers, and above
seventy public libraries were opened in the cities of the Andalusian
kingdom. The age of Arabian learning continued about five hundred years,
till the great eruption of the Moguls, and was coeval with the darkest
and most slothful period of European annals; but since the sun of
science has arisen in the West, it should seem that the Oriental studies
have languished and declined. [54]

[Footnote 51: The Guliston (p. 29) relates the conversation of Mahomet
and a physician, (Epistol. Renaudot. in Fabricius, Bibliot. Graec. tom.
i. p. 814.) The prophet himself was skilled in the art of medicine; and
Gagnier (Vie de Mahomet, tom. iii. p. 394-405) has given an extract of
the aphorisms which are extant under his name.]

[Footnote 52: See their curious architecture in Reaumur (Hist. des
Insectes, tom. v. Memoire viii.) These hexagons are closed by a pyramid;
the angles of the three sides of a similar pyramid, such as would
accomplish the given end with the smallest quantity possible of
materials, were determined by a mathematician, at 109] degrees 26
minutes for the larger, 70 degrees 34 minutes for the smaller. The
actual measure is 109 degrees 28 minutes, 70 degrees 32 minutes. Yet
this perfect harmony raises the work at the expense of the artist he
bees are not masters of transcendent geometry.]

[Footnote 53: Saed Ebn Ahmed, cadhi of Toledo, who died A. H. 462, A.D.
069, has furnished Abulpharagius (Dynast. p. 160) with this curious
passage, as well as with the text of Pocock's Specimen Historiae Arabum.
A number of literary anecdotes of philosophers, physicians, &c., who
have flourished under each caliph, form the principal merit of the
Dynasties of Abulpharagius.]

[Footnote 54: These literary anecdotes are borrowed from the Bibliotheca
Arabico-Hispana, (tom. ii. p. 38, 71, 201, 202,) Leo Africanus, (de
Arab. Medicis et Philosophis, in Fabric. Bibliot. Graec. tom. xiii. p.
259-293, particularly p. 274,) and Renaudot, (Hist. Patriarch. Alex.
p. 274, 275, 536, 537,) besides the chronological remarks of
Abulpharagius.]

In the libraries of the Arabians, as in those of Europe, the far greater
part of the innumerable volumes were possessed only of local value or
imaginary merit. [55] The shelves were crowded with orators and poets,
whose style was adapted to the taste and manners of their countrymen;
with general and partial histories, which each revolving generation
supplied with a new harvest of persons and events; with codes and
commentaries of jurisprudence, which derived their authority from the
law of the prophet; with the interpreters of the Koran, and orthodox
tradition; and with the whole theological tribe, polemics, mystics,
scholastics, and moralists, the first or the last of writers, according
to the different estimates of sceptics or believers. The works of
speculation or science may be reduced to the four classes of philosophy,
mathematics, astronomy, and physic. The sages of Greece were translated
and illustrated in the Arabic language, and some treatises, now lost
in the original, have been recovered in the versions of the East, [56]
which possessed and studied the writings of Aristotle and Plato, of
Euclid and Apollonius, of Ptolemy, Hippocrates, and Galen. [57] Among
the ideal systems which have varied with the fashion of the times, the
Arabians adopted the philosophy of the Stagirite, alike intelligible
or alike obscure for the readers of every age. Plato wrote for the
Athenians, and his allegorical genius is too closely blended with the
language and religion of Greece. After the fall of that religion,
the Peripatetics, emerging from their obscurity, prevailed in the
controversies of the Oriental sects, and their founder was long
afterwards restored by the Mahometans of Spain to the Latin schools.
[58] The physics, both of the Academy and the Lycaeum, as they are
built, not on observation, but on argument, have retarded the progress
of real knowledge. The metaphysics of infinite, or finite, spirit, have
too often been enlisted in the service of superstition. But the human
faculties are fortified by the art and practice of dialectics; the ten
predicaments of Aristotle collect and methodize our ideas, [59] and his
syllogism is the keenest weapon of dispute. It was dexterously wielded
in the schools of the Saracens, but as it is more effectual for the
detection of error than for the investigation of truth, it is not
surprising that new generations of masters and disciples should still
revolve in the same circle of logical argument. The mathematics are
distinguished by a peculiar privilege, that, in the course of ages, they
may always advance, and can never recede. But the ancient geometry, if I
am not misinformed, was resumed in the same state by the Italians of
the fifteenth century; and whatever may be the origin of the name, the
science of algebra is ascribed to the Grecian Diophantus by the modest
testimony of the Arabs themselves. [60] They cultivated with more
success the sublime science of astronomy, which elevates the mind of
man to disdain his diminutive planet and momentary existence. The costly
instruments of observation were supplied by the caliph Almamon, and the
land of the Chaldaeans still afforded the same spacious level, the same
unclouded horizon. In the plains of Sinaar, and a second time in those
of Cufa, his mathematicians accurately measured a degree of the great
circle of the earth, and determined at twenty-four thousand miles the
entire circumference of our globe. [61] From the reign of the Abbassides
to that of the grandchildren of Tamerlane, the stars, without the aid
of glasses, were diligently observed; and the astronomical tables of
Bagdad, Spain, and Samarcand, [62] correct some minute errors, without
daring to renounce the hypothesis of Ptolemy, without advancing a step
towards the discovery of the solar system. In the Eastern courts, the
truths of science could be recommended only by ignorance and folly,
and the astronomer would have been disregarded, had he not debased his
wisdom or honesty by the vain predictions of astrology. [63] But in the
science of medicine, the Arabians have been deservedly applauded. The
names of Mesua and Geber, of Razis and Avicenna, are ranked with
the Grecian masters; in the city of Bagdad, eight hundred and sixty
physicians were licensed to exercise their lucrative profession: [64]
in Spain, the life of the Catholic princes was intrusted to the skill
of the Saracens, [65] and the school of Salerno, their legitimate
offspring, revived in Italy and Europe the precepts of the healing art.
[66] The success of each professor must have been influenced by personal
and accidental causes; but we may form a less fanciful estimate of their
general knowledge of anatomy, [67] botany, [68] and chemistry, [69] the
threefold basis of their theory and practice. A superstitious reverence
for the dead confined both the Greeks and the Arabians to the dissection
of apes and quadrupeds; the more solid and visible parts were known
in the time of Galen, and the finer scrutiny of the human frame was
reserved for the microscope and the injections of modern artists. Botany
is an active science, and the discoveries of the torrid zone might
enrich the herbal of Dioscorides with two thousand plants. Some
traditionary knowledge might be secreted in the temples and monasteries
of Egypt; much useful experience had been acquired in the practice of
arts and manufactures; but the science of chemistry owes its origin and
improvement to the industry of the Saracens. They first invented
and named the alembic for the purposes of distillation, analyzed the
substances of the three kingdoms of nature, tried the distinction and
affinities of alcalis and acids, and converted the poisonous minerals
into soft and salutary medicines. But the most eager search of Arabian
chemistry was the transmutation of metals, and the elixir of immortal
health: the reason and the fortunes of thousands were evaporated in
the crucibles of alchemy, and the consummation of the great work was
promoted by the worthy aid of mystery, fable, and superstition.

[Footnote 55: The Arabic catalogue of the Escurial will give a just idea
of the proportion of the classes. In the library of Cairo, the Mss of
astronomy and medicine amounted to 6500, with two fair globes, the one
of brass, the other of silver, (Bibliot. Arab. Hisp. tom. i. p. 417.)]

[Footnote 56: As, for instance, the fifth, sixth, and seventh books (the
eighth is still wanting) of the Conic Sections of Apollonius Pergaeus,
which were printed from the Florence Ms. 1661, (Fabric. Bibliot. Graec.
tom. ii. p. 559.) Yet the fifth book had been previously restored by the
mathematical divination of Viviani, (see his Eloge in Fontenelle, tom.
v. p. 59, &c.)]

[Footnote 57: The merit of these Arabic versions is freely discussed
by Renaudot, (Fabric. Bibliot. Graec. tom. i. p. 812-816,) and piously
defended by Casiri, (Bibliot. Arab. Hispana, tom. i. p. 238-240.)
Most of the versions of Plato, Aristotle, Hippocrates, Galen, &c., are
ascribed to Honain, a physician of the Nestorian sect, who flourished
at Bagdad in the court of the caliphs, and died A.D. 876. He was at the
head of a school or manufacture of translations, and the works of his
sons and disciples were published under his name. See Abulpharagius,
(Dynast. p. 88, 115, 171-174, and apud Asseman. Bibliot. Orient.

Predicaments of Aristotle may be found in the Philosophical Arrangements

historians. This degree most accurately contains 200,000 royal or
Hashemite cubits which Arabia had derived from the sacred and legal
practice both of Palestine and Egypt. This ancient cubit is repeated
400 times in each basis of the great pyramid, and seems to indicate the
primitive and universal measures of the East. See the Metrologie of the

[Footnote 69: Dr. Watson, (Elements of Chemistry, vol. i. p. 17, &c.)
allows the original merit of the Arabians. Yet he quotes the modest
confession of the famous Geber of the ixth century, (D'Herbelot, p.
387,) that he had drawn most of his science, perhaps the transmutation
of metals, from the ancient sages. Whatever might be the origin or
extent of their knowledge, the arts of chemistry and alchemy appear to
have been known in Egypt at least three hundred years before Mahomet,
(Wotton's Reflections, p. 121-133. Pauw, Recherches sur les Egyptiens
et les Chinois, tom. i. p. 376-429.) * Note: Mr. Whewell (Hist. of
Inductive Sciences, vol. i. p. 336) rejects the claim of the Arabians as
inventors of the science of chemistry. "The formation and realization
of the notions of analysis and affinity were important steps in chemical
science; which, as I shall hereafter endeavor to show it remained for
the chemists of Europe to make at a much later period."--M.]

But the Moslems deprived themselves of the principal benefits of a
familiar intercourse with Greece and Rome, the knowledge of antiquity,
the purity of taste, and the freedom of thought. Confident in the riches
of their native tongue, the Arabians disdained the study of any
foreign idiom. The Greek interpreters were chosen among their Christian
subjects; they formed their translations, sometimes on the original
text, more frequently perhaps on a Syriac version; and in the crowd of
astronomers and physicians, there is no example of a poet, an orator, or
even an historian, being taught to speak the language of the Saracens.
[70] The mythology of Homer would have provoked the abhorrence of those
stern fanatics: they possessed in lazy ignorance the colonies of the
Macedonians, and the provinces of Carthage and Rome: the heroes of
Plutarch and Livy were buried in oblivion; and the history of the world
before Mahomet was reduced to a short legend of the patriarchs, the
prophets, and the Persian kings. Our education in the Greek and Latin
schools may have fixed in our minds a standard of exclusive taste; and
I am not forward to condemn the literature and judgment of nations, of
whose language I am ignorant. Yet I know that the classics have much
to teach, and I believe that the Orientals have much to learn; the
temperate dignity of style, the graceful proportions of art, the forms
of visible and intellectual beauty, the just delineation of character
and passion, the rhetoric of narrative and argument, the regular fabric
of epic and dramatic poetry. [71] The influence of truth and reason
is of a less ambiguous complexion. The philosophers of Athens and Rome
enjoyed the blessings, and asserted the rights, of civil and religious
freedom. Their moral and political writings might have gradually
unlocked the fetters of Eastern despotism, diffused a liberal spirit of
inquiry and toleration, and encouraged the Arabian sages to suspect
that their caliph was a tyrant, and their prophet an impostor. [72] The
instinct of superstition was alarmed by the introduction even of the
abstract sciences; and the more rigid doctors of the law condemned
the rash and pernicious curiosity of Almamon. [73] To the thirst of
martyrdom, the vision of paradise, and the belief of predestination, we
must ascribe the invincible enthusiasm of the prince and people. And the
sword of the Saracens became less formidable when their youth was drawn
away from the camp to the college, when the armies of the faithful
presumed to read and to reflect. Yet the foolish vanity of the Greeks
was jealous of their studies, and reluctantly imparted the sacred fire
to the Barbarians of the East. [74]

[Footnote 70: Abulpharagius (Dynast. p. 26, 148) mentions a Syriac
version of Homer's two poems, by Theophilus, a Christian Maronite of
Mount Libanus, who professed astronomy at Roha or Edessa towards the end
of the viiith century. His work would be a literary curiosity. I
have read somewhere, but I do not believe, that Plutarch's Lives were
translated into Turkish for the use of Mahomet the Second.]

[Footnote 71: I have perused, with much pleasure, Sir William Jones's
Latin Commentary on Asiatic Poetry, (London, 1774, in octavo,) which
was composed in the youth of that wonderful linguist. At present, in
the maturity of his taste and judgment, he would perhaps abate of
the fervent, and even partial, praise which he has bestowed on the
Orientals.]

[Footnote 72: Among the Arabian philosophers, Averroes has been
accused of despising the religions of the Jews, the Christians, and the
Mahometans, (see his article in Bayle's Dictionary.) Each of these
sects would agree, that in two instances out of three, his contempt was
reasonable.]

[Footnote 73: D'Herbelot, Bibliotheque, Orientale, p. 546.]

[Footnote 74: Cedrenus, p. 548, who relates how manfully the emperor
refused a mathematician to the instances and offers of the caliph
Almamon. This absurd scruple is expressed almost in the same words by
the continuator of Theophanes, (Scriptores post Theophanem, p. 118.)]

In the bloody conflict of the Ommiades and Abbassides, the Greeks had
stolen the opportunity of avenging their wrongs and enlarging their
limits. But a severe retribution was exacted by Mohadi, the third caliph
of the new dynasty, who seized, in his turn, the favorable opportunity,
while a woman and a child, Irene and Constantine, were seated on the
Byzantine throne. An army of ninety-five thousand Persians and Arabs
was sent from the Tigris to the Thracian Bosphorus, under the command of
Harun, [75] or Aaron, the second son of the commander of the faithful.
His encampment on the opposite heights of Chrysopolis, or Scutari,
informed Irene, in her palace of Constantinople, of the loss of her
troops and provinces. With the consent or connivance of their sovereign,
her ministers subscribed an ignominious peace; and the exchange of some
royal gifts could not disguise the annual tribute of seventy thousand
dinars of gold, which was imposed on the Roman empire. The Saracens had
too rashly advanced into the midst of a distant and hostile land: their
retreat was solicited by the promise of faithful guides and plentiful
markets; and not a Greek had courage to whisper, that their weary forces
might be surrounded and destroyed in their necessary passage between
a slippery mountain and the River Sangarius. Five years after this
expedition, Harun ascended the throne of his father and his elder
brother; the most powerful and vigorous monarch of his race, illustrious
in the West, as the ally of Charlemagne, and familiar to the most
childish readers, as the perpetual hero of the Arabian tales. His title
to the name of Al Rashid (the Just) is sullied by the extirpation of the
generous, perhaps the innocent, Barmecides; yet he could listen to the
complaint of a poor widow who had been pillaged by his troops, and who
dared, in a passage of the Koran, to threaten the inattentive despot
with the judgment of God and posterity. His court was adorned with
luxury and science; but, in a reign of three-and-twenty years, Harun
repeatedly visited his provinces from Chorasan to Egypt; nine times
he performed the pilgrimage of Mecca; eight times he invaded the
territories of the Romans; and as often as they declined the payment of
the tribute, they were taught to feel that a month of depredation was
more costly than a year of submission. But when the unnatural mother
of Constantine was deposed and banished, her successor, Nicephorus,
resolved to obliterate this badge of servitude and disgrace. The epistle
of the emperor to the caliph was pointed with an allusion to the game
of chess, which had already spread from Persia to Greece. "The queen (he
spoke of Irene) considered you as a rook, and herself as a pawn. That
pusillanimous female submitted to pay a tribute, the double of which she
ought to have exacted from the Barbarians. Restore therefore the fruits
of your injustice, or abide the determination of the sword." At these
words the ambassadors cast a bundle of swords before the foot of the
throne. The caliph smiled at the menace, and drawing his cimeter,
samsamah, a weapon of historic or fabulous renown, he cut asunder the
feeble arms of the Greeks, without turning the edge, or endangering the
temper, of his blade. He then dictated an epistle of tremendous brevity:
"In the name of the most merciful God, Harun al Rashid, commander of the
faithful, to Nicephorus, the Roman dog. I have read thy letter, O thou
son of an unbelieving mother. Thou shalt not hear, thou shalt behold, my
reply." It was written in characters of blood and fire on the plains of
Phrygia; and the warlike celerity of the Arabs could only be checked by
the arts of deceit and the show of repentance.

The triumphant caliph retired, after the fatigues of the campaign, to
his favorite palace of Racca on the Euphrates: [76] but the distance
of five hundred miles, and the inclemency of the season, encouraged his
adversary to violate the peace. Nicephorus was astonished by the bold
and rapid march of the commander of the faithful, who repassed, in the
depth of winter, the snows of Mount Taurus: his stratagems of policy and
war were exhausted; and the perfidious Greek escaped with three wounds
from a field of battle overspread with forty thousand of his subjects.
Yet the emperor was ashamed of submission, and the caliph was resolved
on victory. One hundred and thirty-five thousand regular soldiers
received pay, and were inscribed in the military roll; and above three
hundred thousand persons of every denomination marched under the black
standard of the Abbassides. They swept the surface of Asia Minor far
beyond Tyana and Ancyra, and invested the Pontic Heraclea, [77] once
a flourishing state, now a paltry town; at that time capable of
sustaining, in her antique walls, a month's siege against the forces of
the East. The ruin was complete, the spoil was ample; but if Harun had
been conversant with Grecian story, he would have regretted the statue
of Hercules, whose attributes, the club, the bow, the quiver, and the
lion's hide, were sculptured in massy gold. The progress of desolation
by sea and land, from the Euxine to the Isle of Cyprus, compelled the
emperor Nicephorus to retract his haughty defiance. In the new treaty,
the ruins of Heraclea were left forever as a lesson and a trophy; and
the coin of the tribute was marked with the image and superscription
of Harun and his three sons. [78] Yet this plurality of lords might
contribute to remove the dishonor of the Roman name. After the death of
their father, the heirs of the caliph were involved in civil discord,
and the conqueror, the liberal Almamon, was sufficiently engaged in the
restoration of domestic peace and the introduction of foreign science.

[Footnote 75: See the reign and character of Harun Al Rashid, in the
Bibliotheque Orientale, p. 431-433, under his proper title; and in the
relative articles to which M. D'Herbelot refers. That learned collector
has shown much taste in stripping the Oriental chronicles of their
instructive and amusing anecdotes.]

[Footnote 76: For the situation of Racca, the old Nicephorium, consult
D'Anville, (l'Euphrate et le Tigre, p. 24-27.) The Arabian Nights
represent Harun al Rashid as almost stationary in Bagdad. He respected
the royal seat of the Abbassides: but the vices of the inhabitants had
driven him from the city, (Abulfed. Annal. p. 167.)]

[Footnote 77: M. de Tournefort, in his coasting voyage from
Constantinople to Trebizond, passed a night at Heraclea or Eregri. His
eye surveyed the present state, his reading collected the antiquities,
of the city (Voyage du Levant, tom. iii. lettre xvi. p. 23-35.) We have
a separate history of Heraclea in the fragments of Memnon, which are
