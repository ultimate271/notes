## Chapter LVII: The Turks.--Part III.

The greatness and unity of the Turkish empire expired in the person of
Malek Shah. His vacant throne was disputed by his brother and his
four sons; [461] and, after a series of civil wars, the treaty which
reconciled the surviving candidates confirmed a lasting separation in
the Persian dynasty, the eldest and principal branch of the house of
Seljuk. The three younger dynasties were those of Kerman, of Syria, and
of Roum: the first of these commanded an extensive, though obscure, [47]
dominion on the shores of the Indian Ocean: [48] the second expelled
the Arabian princes of Aleppo and Damascus; and the third, our peculiar
care, invaded the Roman provinces of Asia Minor. The generous policy
of Malek contributed to their elevation: he allowed the princes of
his blood, even those whom he had vanquished in the field, to seek
new kingdoms worthy of their ambition; nor was he displeased that they
should draw away the more ardent spirits, who might have disturbed the
tranquillity of his reign. As the supreme head of his family and nation,
the great sultan of Persia commanded the obedience and tribute of his
royal brethren: the thrones of Kerman and Nice, of Aleppo and Damascus;
the Atabeks, and emirs of Syria and Mesopotamia, erected their standards
under the shadow of his sceptre: [49] and the hordes of Turkmans
overspread the plains of the Western Asia.

After the death of Malek, the bands of union and subordination were
relaxed and finally dissolved: the indulgence of the house of Seljuk
invested their slaves with the inheritance of kingdoms; and, in the
Oriental style, a crowd of princes arose from the dust of their feet.

the Caspian to the Straits of Babelmandel."--M.]

[Footnote 47: So obscure, that the industry of M. De Guignes could only
copy (tom. i. p. 244, tom. iii. part i. p. 269, &c.) the history, or
rather list, of the Seljukides of Kerman, in Bibliotheque Orientale.
They were extinguished before the end of the xiith century.]

[Footnote 48: Tavernier, perhaps the only traveller who has visited
Kerman, describes the capital as a great ruinous village, twenty-five
days' journey from Ispahan, and twenty-seven from Ormus, in the midst of
a fertile country, (Voyages en Turquie et en Perse, p. 107, 110.)]

[Footnote 49: It appears from Anna Comnena, that the Turks of Asia Minor
obeyed the signet and chiauss of the great sultan, (Alexias, l. vi. p.
170;) and that the two sons of Soliman were detained in his court, (p.
180.)]

[Footnote 50: This expression is quoted by Petit de la Croix (Vie de
Gestis p. 160) from some poet, most probably a Persian.]

A prince of the royal line, Cutulmish, [501] the son of Izrail, the
son of Seljuk, had fallen in a battle against Alp Arslan and the humane
victor had dropped a tear over his grave. His five sons, strong in arms,
ambitious of power, and eager for revenge, unsheathed their cimeters
against the son of Alp Arslan. The two armies expected the signal when
the caliph, forgetful of the majesty which secluded him from vulgar
eyes, interposed his venerable mediation. "Instead of shedding the blood
of your brethren, your brethren both in descent and faith, unite your
forces in a holy war against the Greeks, the enemies of God and his
apostle." They listened to his voice; the sultan embraced his rebellious
kinsmen; and the eldest, the valiant Soliman, accepted the royal
standard, which gave him the free conquest and hereditary command of the
provinces of the Roman empire, from Arzeroum to Constantinople, and the
unknown regions of the West. [51] Accompanied by his four brothers,
he passed the Euphrates; the Turkish camp was soon seated in the
neighborhood of Kutaieh in Phrygia; and his flying cavalry laid waste
the country as far as the Hellespont and the Black Sea. Since the
decline of the empire, the peninsula of Asia Minor had been exposed to
the transient, though destructive, inroads of the Persians and Saracens;
but the fruits of a lasting conquest were reserved for the Turkish
sultan; and his arms were introduced by the Greeks, who aspired to reign
on the ruins of their country. Since the captivity of Romanus, six years
the feeble son of Eudocia had trembled under the weight of the Imperial
crown, till the provinces of the East and West were lost in the same
month by a double rebellion: of either chief Nicephorus was the common
name; but the surnames of Bryennius and Botoniates distinguish the
European and Asiatic candidates. Their reasons, or rather their
promises, were weighed in the Divan; and, after some hesitation, Soliman
declared himself in favor of Botoniates, opened a free passage to his
troops in their march from Antioch to Nice, and joined the banner of the
Crescent to that of the Cross. After his ally had ascended the throne of
Constantinople, the sultan was hospitably entertained in the suburb of
Chrysopolis or Scutari; and a body of two thousand Turks was transported
into Europe, to whose dexterity and courage the new emperor was indebted
for the defeat and captivity of his rival, Bryennius. But the conquest
of Europe was dearly purchased by the sacrifice of Asia: Constantinople
was deprived of the obedience and revenue of the provinces beyond the
Bosphorus and Hellespont; and the regular progress of the Turks, who
fortified the passes of the rivers and mountains, left not a hope of
their retreat or expulsion. Another candidate implored the aid of the
sultan: Melissenus, in his purple robes and red buskins, attended the
motions of the Turkish camp; and the desponding cities were tempted by
the summons of a Roman prince, who immediately surrendered them into the
hands of the Barbarians. These acquisitions were confirmed by a treaty
of peace with the emperor Alexius: his fear of Robert compelled him to
seek the friendship of Soliman; and it was not till after the sultan's
death that he extended as far as Nicomedia, about sixty miles from
Constantinople, the eastern boundary of the Roman world. Trebizond
alone, defended on either side by the sea and mountains, preserved at
the extremity of the Euxine the ancient character of a Greek colony, and
the future destiny of a Christian empire.

[Footnote 501: Wilken considers Cutulmish not a Turkish name. Geschicht
Kreuz-zuge, vol. i. p. 9.--M.]

[Footnote 51: On the conquest of Asia Minor, M. De Guignes has derived
no assistance from the Turkish or Arabian writers, who produce a naked
list of the Seljukides of Roum. The Greeks are unwilling to expose their
shame, and we must extort some hints from Scylitzes, (p. 860, 863,)
Nicephorus Bryennius, (p. 88, 91, 92, &c., 103, 104,) and Anna Comnena
(Alexias, p. 91, 92, &c., 163, &c.)]

Since the first conquests of the caliphs, the establishment of the Turks
in Anatolia or Asia Minor was the most deplorable loss which the church
and empire had sustained. By the propagation of the Moslem faith,
Soliman deserved the name of Gazi, a holy champion; and his new
kingdoms, of the Romans, or of Roum, was added to the tables of
Oriental geography. It is described as extending from the Euphrates to
Constantinople, from the Black Sea to the confines of Syria; pregnant
with mines of silver and iron, of alum and copper, fruitful in corn and
wine, and productive of cattle and excellent horses. [52] The wealth of
Lydia, the arts of the Greeks, the splendor of the Augustan age, existed
only in books and ruins, which were equally obscure in the eyes of the
Scythian conquerors. Yet, in the present decay, Anatolia still contains
some wealthy and populous cities; and, under the Byzantine empire, they
were far more flourishing in numbers, size, and opulence. By the choice
of the sultan, Nice, the metropolis of Bithynia, was preferred for
his palace and fortress: the seat of the Seljukian dynasty of Roum
was planted one hundred miles from Constantinople; and the divinity of
Christ was denied and derided in the same temple in which it had been
pronounced by the first general synod of the Catholics. The unity
of God, and the mission of Mahomet, were preached in the moschs; the
Arabian learning was taught in the schools; the Cadhis judged according
to the law of the Koran; the Turkish manners and language prevailed
in the cities; and Turkman camps were scattered over the plains and
mountains of Anatolia. On the hard conditions of tribute and servitude,
the Greek Christians might enjoy the exercise of their religion; but
their most holy churches were profaned; their priests and bishops were
insulted; [53] they were compelled to suffer the triumph of the Pagans,
and the apostasy of their brethren; many thousand children were marked
by the knife of circumcision; and many thousand captives were devoted
to the service or the pleasures of their masters. [54] After the loss
of Asia, Antioch still maintained her primitive allegiance to Christ and
Caesar; but the solitary province was separated from all Roman aid,
and surrounded on all sides by the Mahometan powers. The despair of
Philaretus the governor prepared the sacrifice of his religion and
loyalty, had not his guilt been prevented by his son, who hastened to
the Nicene palace, and offered to deliver this valuable prize into the
hands of Soliman. The ambitious sultan mounted on horseback, and in
twelve nights (for he reposed in the day) performed a march of six
hundred miles. Antioch was oppressed by the speed and secrecy of
his enterprise; and the dependent cities, as far as Laodicea and the
confines of Aleppo, [55] obeyed the example of the metropolis. From
Laodicea to the Thracian Bosphorus, or arm of St. George, the conquests
and reign of Soliman extended thirty days' journey in length, and in
breadth about ten or fifteen, between the rocks of Lycia and the Black
Sea. [56] The Turkish ignorance of navigation protected, for a while,
the inglorious safety of the emperor; but no sooner had a fleet of two
hundred ships been constructed by the hands of the captive Greeks, than
Alexius trembled behind the walls of his capital. His plaintive epistles
were dispersed over Europe, to excite the compassion of the Latins,
and to paint the danger, the weakness, and the riches of the city of
Constantine. [57]

[Footnote 52: Such is the description of Roum by Haiton the Armenian,
whose Tartar history may be found in the collections of Ramusio and
Bergeron, (see Abulfeda, Geograph. climat. xvii. p. 301-305.)]

[Footnote 53: Dicit eos quendam abusione Sodomitica intervertisse
episcopum, (Guibert. Abbat. Hist. Hierosol. l. i. p. 468.) It is odd
enough, that we should find a parallel passage of the same people in the
present age. "Il n'est point d'horreur que ces Turcs n'ayent commis,
et semblables aux soldats effrenes, qui dans le sac d'une ville, non
contens de disposer de tout a leur gre pretendent encore aux succes
les moins desirables. Quelque Sipahis ont porte leurs attentats sur la
personne du vieux rabbi de la synagogue, et celle de l'Archeveque Grec."
(Memoires du Baron de Tott, tom. ii. p. 193.)]

[Footnote 54: The emperor, or abbot describe the scenes of a Turkish
camp as if they had been present. Matres correptae in conspectu filiarum
multipliciter repetitis diversorum coitibus vexabantur; (is that the
true reading?) cum filiae assistentes carmina praecinere saltando
cogerentur. Mox eadem passio ad filias, &c.]

(Alexius, l. vi. p. 168, 169,) with the notes of Ducange.]

[Footnote 56: William of Tyre (l. i. c. 9, 10, p. 635) gives the most
authentic and deplorable account of these Turkish conquests.]

[Footnote 57: In his epistle to the count of Flanders, Alexius seems to
fall too low beneath his character and dignity; yet it is approved by
Ducange, (Not. ad Alexiad. p. 335, &c.,) and paraphrased by the Abbot
Guibert, a contemporary historian. The Greek text no longer exists;
and each translator and scribe might say with Guibert, (p. 475,) verbis
vestita meis, a privilege of most indefinite latitude.]

But the most interesting conquest of the Seljukian Turks was that of
Jerusalem, [58] which soon became the theatre of nations. In their
capitulation with Omar, the inhabitants had stipulated the assurance
of their religion and property; but the articles were interpreted by a
master against whom it was dangerous to dispute; and in the four hundred
years of the reign of the caliphs, the political climate of Jerusalem
was exposed to the vicissitudes of storm and sunshine. [59] By the
increase of proselytes and population, the Mahometans might excuse the
usurpation of three fourths of the city: but a peculiar quarter was
resolved for the patriarch with his clergy and people; a tribute of two
pieces of gold was the price of protection; and the sepulchre of Christ,
with the church of the Resurrection, was still left in the hands of his
votaries. Of these votaries, the most numerous and respectable portion
were strangers to Jerusalem: the pilgrimages to the Holy Land had been
stimulated, rather than suppressed, by the conquest of the Arabs; and
the enthusiasm which had always prompted these perilous journeys, was
nourished by the congenial passions of grief and indignation. A crowd of
pilgrims from the East and West continued to visit the holy sepulchre,
and the adjacent sanctuaries, more especially at the festival of Easter;
and the Greeks and Latins, the Nestorians and Jacobites, the Copts and
Abyssinians, the Armenians and Georgians, maintained the chapels, the
clergy, and the poor of their respective communions. The harmony of
prayer in so many various tongues, the worship of so many nations in
the common temple of their religion, might have afforded a spectacle
of edification and peace; but the zeal of the Christian sects was
imbittered by hatred and revenge; and in the kingdom of a suffering
Messiah, who had pardoned his enemies, they aspired to command and
persecute their spiritual brethren. The preeminence was asserted by the
spirit and numbers of the Franks; and the greatness of Charlemagne [60]
protected both the Latin pilgrims and the Catholics of the East. The
poverty of Carthage, Alexandria, and Jerusalem, was relieved by the alms
of that pious emperor; and many monasteries of Palestine were founded
or restored by his liberal devotion. Harun Alrashid, the greatest of
the Abbassides, esteemed in his Christian brother a similar supremacy
of genius and power: their friendship was cemented by a frequent
intercourse of gifts and embassies; and the caliph, without resigning
the substantial dominion, presented the emperor with the keys of the
holy sepulchre, and perhaps of the city of Jerusalem. In the decline of
the Carlovingian monarchy, the republic of Amalphi promoted the interest
of trade and religion in the East. Her vessels transported the Latin
pilgrims to the coasts of Egypt and Palestine, and deserved, by their
useful imports, the favor and alliance of the Fatimite caliphs: [61] an
annual fair was instituted on Mount Calvary: and the Italian merchants
founded the convent and hospital of St. John of Jerusalem, the cradle of
the monastic and military order, which has since reigned in the isles of
Rhodes and of Malta. Had the Christian pilgrims been content to revere
the tomb of a prophet, the disciples of Mahomet, instead of blaming,
would have imitated, their piety: but these rigid Unitarians were
scandalized by a worship which represents the birth, death, and
resurrection, of a God; the Catholic images were branded with the name
of idols; and the Moslems smiled with indignation [62] at the miraculous
flame which was kindled on the eve of Easter in the holy sepulchre. [63]
This pious fraud, first devised in the ninth century, [64] was devoutly
cherished by the Latin crusaders, and is annually repeated by the
clergy of the Greek, Armenian, and Coptic sects, [65] who impose on
the credulous spectators [66] for their own benefit, and that of their
tyrants. In every age, a principle of toleration has been fortified by
a sense of interest: and the revenue of the prince and his emir was
increased each year, by the expense and tribute of so many thousand
strangers.

[Footnote 58: Our best fund for the history of Jerusalem from Heraclius
to the crusades is contained in two large and original passages of
William archbishop of Tyre, (l. i. c. 1-10, l. xviii. c. 5, 6,)
the principal author of the Gesta Dei per Francos. M. De Guignes has
composed a very learned Memoire sur le Commerce des Francois dans le de
Levant avant les Croisades, &c. (Mem. de l'Academie des Inscriptions,
tom. xxxvii. p. 467-500.)]

[Footnote 59: Secundum Dominorum dispositionem plerumque lucida plerum
que nubila recepit intervalla, et aegrotantium more temporum praesentium
gravabatur aut respirabat qualitate, (l. i. c. 3, p. 630.) The latinity
of William of Tyre is by no means contemptible: but in his account of
490 years, from the loss to the recovery of Jerusalem, precedes the true
account by 30 years.]

[Footnote 60: For the transactions of Charlemagne with the Holy Land,
see Eginhard, (de Vita Caroli Magni, c. 16, p. 79-82,) Constantine
Porphyrogenitus, (de Administratione Imperii, l. ii. c. 26, p. 80,) and
Pagi, (Critica, tom. iii. A.D. 800, No. 13, 14, 15.)]

[Footnote 61: The caliph granted his privileges, Amalphitanis viris
amicis et utilium introductoribus, (Gesta Dei, p. 934.) The trade of
Venice to Egypt and Palestine cannot produce so old a title, unless
we adopt the laughable translation of a Frenchman, who mistook the
two factions of the circus (Veneti et Prasini) for the Venetians and
Parisians.]

[Footnote 62: An Arabic chronicle of Jerusalem (apud Asseman. Bibliot.
Orient. tom. i. p. 268, tom. iv. p. 368) attests the unbelief of the
caliph and the historian; yet Cantacuzene presumes to appeal to the
Mahometans themselves for the truth of this perpetual miracle.]

[Footnote 63: In his Dissertations on Ecclesiastical History, the
learned Mosheim has separately discussed this pretended miracle, (tom.
ii. p. 214-306,) de lumine sancti sepulchri.]

[Footnote 64: William of Malmsbury (l. iv. c. 2, p. 209) quotes the
Itinerary of the monk Bernard, an eye-witness, who visited Jerusalem
A.D. 870. The miracle is confirmed by another pilgrim some years older;
and Mosheim ascribes the invention to the Franks, soon after the decease
of Charlemagne.]

[Footnote 65: Our travellers, Sandys, (p. 134,) Thevenot, (p. 621-627,)
Maundrell, (p. 94, 95,) &c., describes this extravagant farce. The
Catholics are puzzled to decide when the miracle ended and the trick
began.]

[Footnote 66: The Orientals themselves confess the fraud, and plead
necessity and edification, (Memoires du Chevalier D'Arvieux, tom. ii. p.
140. Joseph Abudacni, Hist. Copt. c. 20;) but I will not attempt, with
Mosheim, to explain the mode. Our travellers have failed with the blood
of St. Januarius at Naples.]

The revolution which transferred the sceptre from the Abbassides to
the Fatimites was a benefit, rather than an injury, to the Holy Land.
A sovereign resident in Egypt was more sensible of the importance of
Christian trade; and the emirs of Palestine were less remote from the
justice and power of the throne. But the third of these Fatimite caliphs
was the famous Hakem, [67] a frantic youth, who was delivered by his
impiety and despotism from the fear either of God or man; and whose
reign was a wild mixture of vice and folly. Regardless of the
most ancient customs of Egypt, he imposed on the women an absolute
confinement; the restraint excited the clamors of both sexes; their
clamors provoked his fury; a part of Old Cairo was delivered to the
flames and the guards and citizens were engaged many days in a bloody
conflict. At first the caliph declared himself a zealous Mussulman, the
founder or benefactor of moschs and colleges: twelve hundred and ninety
copies of the Koran were transcribed at his expense in letters of gold;
and his edict extirpated the vineyards of the Upper Egypt. But his
vanity was soon flattered by the hope of introducing a new religion;
he aspired above the fame of a prophet, and styled himself the visible
image of the Most High God, who, after nine apparitions on earth, was at
length manifest in his royal person. At the name of Hakem, the lord of
the living and the dead, every knee was bent in religious adoration:
his mysteries were performed on a mountain near Cairo: sixteen thousand
converts had signed his profession of faith; and at the present hour, a
free and warlike people, the Druses of Mount Libanus, are persuaded
of the life and divinity of a madman and tyrant. [68] In his divine
character, Hakem hated the Jews and Christians, as the servants of his
rivals; while some remains of prejudice or prudence still pleaded in
favor of the law of Mahomet. Both in Egypt and Palestine, his cruel
and wanton persecution made some martyrs and many apostles: the common
rights and special privileges of the sectaries were equally disregarded;
and a general interdict was laid on the devotion of strangers
and natives. The temple of the Christian world, the church of the
Resurrection, was demolished to its foundations; the luminous prodigy of
Easter was interrupted, and much profane labor was exhausted to destroy
the cave in the rock which properly constitutes the holy sepulchre. At
the report of this sacrilege, the nations of Europe were astonished and
afflicted: but instead of arming in the defence of the Holy Land, they
contented themselves with burning, or banishing, the Jews, as the secret
advisers of the impious Barbarian. [69] Yet the calamities of Jerusalem
were in some measure alleviated by the inconstancy or repentance of
Hakem himself; and the royal mandate was sealed for the restitution of
the churches, when the tyrant was assassinated by the emissaries of
his sister. The succeeding caliphs resumed the maxims of religion and
policy: a free toleration was again granted; with the pious aid of the
emperor of Constantinople, the holy sepulchre arose from its ruins;
and, after a short abstinence, the pilgrims returned with an increase
of appetite to the spiritual feast. [70] In the sea-voyage of Palestine,
the dangers were frequent, and the opportunities rare: but the
conversion of Hungary opened a safe communication between Germany and
Greece. The charity of St. Stephen, the apostle of his kingdom, relieved
and conducted his itinerant brethren; [71] and from Belgrade to Antioch,
they traversed fifteen hundred miles of a Christian empire. Among the
Franks, the zeal of pilgrimage prevailed beyond the example of former
times: and the roads were covered with multitudes of either sex, and of
every rank, who professed their contempt of life, so soon as they should
have kissed the tomb of their Redeemer. Princes and prelates abandoned
the care of their dominions; and the numbers of these pious caravans
were a prelude to the armies which marched in the ensuing age under the
banner of the cross. About thirty years before the first crusade,
the arch bishop of Mentz, with the bishops of Utrecht, Bamberg, and
Ratisbon, undertook this laborious journey from the Rhine to the Jordan;
and the multitude of their followers amounted to seven thousand persons.
At Constantinople, they were hospitably entertained by the emperor; but
the ostentation of their wealth provoked the assault of the wild Arabs:
they drew their swords with scrupulous reluctance, and sustained
siege in the village of Capernaum, till they were rescued by the venal
protection of the Fatimite emir. After visiting the holy places, they
embarked for Italy, but only a remnant of two thousand arrived in safety
in their native land.

Ingulphus, a secretary of William the Conqueror, was a companion of this
pilgrimage: he observes that they sailed from Normandy, thirty stout
and well-appointed horsemen; but that they repassed the Alps, twenty
miserable palmers, with the staff in their hand, and the wallet at their
back. [72]

[Footnote 68: The religion of the Druses is concealed by their ignorance
and hypocrisy. Their secret doctrines are confined to the elect
who profess a contemplative life; and the vulgar Druses, the most
indifferent of men, occasionally conform to the worship of the
Mahometans and Christians of their neighborhood. The little that is, or
deserves to be, known, may be seen in the industrious Niebuhr,
(Voyages, tom. ii. p. 354-357,) and the second volume of the recent and
instructive Travels of M. de Volney. * Note: The religion of the Druses
has, within the present year, been fully developed from their own
writings, which have long lain neglected in the libraries of Paris and
Oxford, in the "Expose de la Religion des Druses, by M. Silvestre de
Sacy." Deux tomes, Paris, 1838. The learned author has prefixed a life
of Hakem Biamr-Allah, which enables us to correct several errors in the
account of Gibbon. These errors chiefly arose from his want of knowledge
or of attention to the chronology of Hakem's life. Hakem succeeded to
the throne of Egypt in the year of the Hegira 386. He did not assume
his divinity till 408. His life was indeed "a wild mixture of vice and
folly," to which may be added, of the most sanguinary cruelty. During
his reign, 18,000 persons were victims of his ferocity. Yet such is the
god, observes M. de Sacy, whom the Druses have worshipped for 800 years!
(See p. ccccxxix.) All his wildest and most extravagant actions were
interpreted by his followers as having a mystic and allegoric meaning,
alluding to the destruction of other religions and the propagation
of his own. It does not seem to have been the "vanity" of Hakem which
induced him to introduce a new religion. The curious point in the new
faith is that Hamza, the son of Ali, the real founder of the Unitarian
religion, (such is its boastful title,) was content to take a secondary
part. While Hakem was God, the one Supreme, the Imam Hamza was his
Intelligence. It was not in his "divine character" that Hakem "hated
the Jews and Christians," but in that of a Mahometan bigot, which he
displayed in the earlier years of his reign. His barbarous persecution,
and the burning of the church of the Resurrection at Jerusalem, belong
entirely to that period; and his assumption of divinity was followed
by an edict of toleration to Jews and Christians. The Mahometans, whose
religion he then treated with hostility and contempt, being far the most
numerous, were his most dangerous enemies, and therefore the objects of
his most inveterate hatred. It is another singular fact, that the
religion of Hakem was by no means confined to Egypt and Syria. M. de
Sacy quotes a letter addressed to the chief of the sect in India; and
there is likewise a letter to the Byzantine emperor Constantine, son of
Armanous, (Romanus,) and the clergy of the empire. (Constantine VIII.,
M. de Sacy supposes, but this is irreconcilable with chronology; it must
mean Constantine XI., Monomachus.) The assassination of Hakem is, of
course, disbelieved by his sectaries. M. de Sacy seems to consider the
fact obscure and doubtful. According to his followers he disappeared,
but is hereafter to return. At his return the resurrection is to take
place; the triumph of Unitarianism, and the final discomfiture of all
other religions. The temple of Mecca is especially devoted to
destruction. It is remarkable that one of the signs of this final
consummation, and of the reappearance of Hakem, is that Christianity
shall be gaining a manifest predominance over Mahometanism. As for the
religion of the Druses, I cannot agree with Gibbon that it does not
"deserve" to be better known; and am grateful to M. de Sacy,
notwithstanding the prolixity and occasional repetition in his two large
volumes, for the full examination of the most extraordinary religious
aberration which ever extensively affected the mind of man. The worship
of a mad tyrant is the basis of a subtle metaphysical creed, and of a
severe, and even ascetic, morality.--M.]

After the defeat of the Romans, the tranquillity of the Fatimite caliphs
was invaded by the Turks. [73] One of the lieutenants of Malek Shah,
Atsiz the Carizmian, marched into Syria at the head of a powerful army,
and reduced Damascus by famine and the sword. Hems, and the other cities
of the province, acknowledged the caliph of Bagdad and the sultan of
Persia; and the victorious emir advanced without resistance to the banks
of the Nile: the Fatimite was preparing to fly into the heart of
Africa; but the negroes of his guard and the inhabitants of Cairo made
a desperate sally, and repulsed the Turk from the confines of Egypt. In
his retreat he indulged the license of slaughter and rapine: the judge
and notaries of Jerusalem were invited to his camp; and their execution
was followed by the massacre of three thousand citizens. The cruelty or
the defeat of Atsiz was soon punished by the sultan Toucush, the brother
of Malek Shah, who, with a higher title and more formidable powers,
asserted the dominion of Syria and Palestine. The house of Seljuk
reigned about twenty years in Jerusalem; [74] but the hereditary command
of the holy city and territory was intrusted or abandoned to the emir
Ortok, the chief of a tribe of Turkmans, whose children, after their
expulsion from Palestine, formed two dynasties on the borders of
Armenia and Assyria. [75] The Oriental Christians and the Latin pilgrims
deplored a revolution, which, instead of the regular government and old
alliance of the caliphs, imposed on their necks the iron yoke of the
strangers of the North. [76] In his court and camp the great sultan had
adopted in some degree the arts and manners of Persia; but the body
of the Turkish nation, and more especially the pastoral tribes, still
breathed the fierceness of the desert. From Nice to Jerusalem,
the western countries of Asia were a scene of foreign and domestic
hostility; and the shepherds of Palestine, who held a precarious sway on
a doubtful frontier, had neither leisure nor capacity to await the slow
profits of commercial and religious freedom. The pilgrims, who, through
innumerable perils, had reached the gates of Jerusalem, were the
victims of private rapine or public oppression, and often sunk under the
pressure of famine and disease, before they were permitted to salute the
holy sepulchre. A spirit of native barbarism, or recent zeal, prompted
the Turkmans to insult the clergy of every sect: the patriarch was
dragged by the hair along the pavement, and cast into a dungeon, to
extort a ransom from the sympathy of his flock; and the divine worship
in the church of the Resurrection was often disturbed by the savage
rudeness of its masters. The pathetic tale excited the millions of the
West to march under the standard of the cross to the relief of the Holy
Land; and yet how trifling is the sum of these accumulated evils, if
compared with the single act of the sacrilege of Hakem, which had been
so patiently endured by the Latin Christians! A slighter provocation
inflamed the more irascible temper of their descendants: a new spirit
had arisen of religious chivalry and papal dominion; a nerve was touched
of exquisite feeling; and the sensation vibrated to the heart of Europe.

to the expulsion of the Ortokides, (A.D. 1096.) Yet William of Tyre (l.
i. c. 6, p. 633) asserts, that Jerusalem was thirty-eight years in the
hands of the Turks; and an Arabic chronicle, quoted by Pagi, (tom. iv.
p. 202) supposes that the city was reduced by a Carizmian general to
the obedience of the caliph of Bagdad, A. H. 463, A.D. 1070. These early
dates are not very compatible with the general history of Asia; and I am
sure, that as late as A.D. 1064, the regnum Babylonicum (of Cairo) still
prevailed in Palestine, (Baronius, A.D. 1064, No. 56.)]

magnify the Christian grievances. The Turks exacted an aureus from each
pilgrim! The caphar of the Franks now is fourteen dollars: and Europe
does not complain of this voluntary tax.]
