## Chapter XXXVIII: Reign Of Clovis.--Part III.

When justice inexorably requires the death of a murderer, each private
citizen is fortified by the assurance, that the laws, the magistrate,
and the whole community, are the guardians of his personal safety. But
in the loose society of the Germans, revenge was always honorable, and
often meritorious: the independent warrior chastised, or vindicated,
with his own hand, the injuries which he had offered or received; and he
had only to dread the resentment of the sons and kinsmen of the enemy,
whom he had sacrificed to his selfish or angry passions. The magistrate,
conscious of his weakness, interposed, not to punish, but to reconcile;
and he was satisfied if he could persuade or compel the contending
parties to pay and to accept the moderate fine which had been
ascertained as the price of blood. [72] The fierce spirit of the
Franks would have opposed a more rigorous sentence; the same fierceness
despised these ineffectual restraints; and, when their simple manners
had been corrupted by the wealth of Gaul, the public peace was
continually violated by acts of hasty or deliberate guilt. In every just
government the same penalty is inflicted, or at least is imposed,
for the murder of a peasant or a prince. But the national inequality
established by the Franks, in their criminal proceedings, was the last
insult and abuse of conquest. [73] In the calm moments of legislation,
they solemnly pronounced, that the life of a Roman was of smaller value
than that of a Barbarian. The Antrustion, [74] a name expressive of the
most illustrious birth or dignity among the Franks, was appreciated at
the sum of six hundred pieces of gold; while the noble provincial,
who was admitted to the king's table, might be legally murdered at the
expense of three hundred pieces.

Two hundred were deemed sufficient for a Frank of ordinary condition;
but the meaner Romans were exposed to disgrace and danger by a trifling
compensation of one hundred, or even fifty, pieces of gold. Had these
laws been regulated by any principle of equity or reason, the public
protection should have supplied, in just proportion, the want of
personal strength. But the legislator had weighed in the scale, not of
justice, but of policy, the loss of a soldier against that of a slave:
the head of an insolent and rapacious Barbarian was guarded by a
heavy fine; and the slightest aid was afforded to the most defenceless
subjects. Time insensibly abated the pride of the conquerors and the
patience of the vanquished; and the boldest citizen was taught, by
experience, that he might suffer more injuries than he could inflict.
As the manners of the Franks became less ferocious, their laws were
rendered more severe; and the Merovingian kings attempted to imitate the
impartial rigor of the Visigoths and Burgundians. [75] Under the empire
of Charlemagne, murder was universally punished with death; and the
use of capital punishments has been liberally multiplied in the
jurisprudence of modern Europe. [76]

[Footnote 72: In the heroic times of Greece, the guilt of murder was
expiated by a pecuniary satisfaction to the family of the deceased,
(Feithius Antiquitat. Homeric. l. ii. c. 8.) Heineccius, in his preface
to the Elements of Germanic Law, favorably suggests, that at Rome and
Athens homicide was only punished with exile. It is true: but exile was
a capital punishment for a citizen of Rome or Athens.]

[Footnote 73: This proportion is fixed by the Salic (tit. xliv. in tom.
iv. p. 147) and the Ripuarian (tit. vii. xi. xxxvi. in tom. iv. p. 237,
241) laws: but the latter does not distinguish any difference of Romans.
Yet the orders of the clergy are placed above the Franks themselves, and
the Burgundians and Alemanni between the Franks and the Romans.]

[Footnote 74: The Antrustiones, qui in truste Dominica sunt, leudi,
fideles, undoubtedly represent the first order of Franks; but it is
a question whether their rank was personal or hereditary. The Abbe de
Mably (tom. i. p. 334-347) is not displeased to mortify the pride
of birth (Esprit, l. xxx. c. 25) by dating the origin of the French
nobility from the reign Clotaire II. (A.D. 615.)]

[Footnote 75: See the Burgundian laws, (tit. ii. in tom. iv. p. 257,)
the code of the Visigoths, (l. vi. tit. v. in tom. p. 384,) and
the constitution of Childebert, not of Paris, but most evidently of
Austrasia, (in tom. iv. p. 112.) Their premature severity was sometimes
rash, and excessive. Childebert condemned not only murderers but
robbers; quomodo sine lege involavit, sine lege moriatur; and even
the negligent judge was involved in the same sentence. The Visigoths
abandoned an unsuccessful surgeon to the family of his deceased patient,
ut quod de eo facere voluerint habeant potestatem, (l. xi. tit. i. in
tom. iv. p. 435.)]

[Footnote 76: See, in the sixth volume of the works of Heineccius, the
Elementa Juris Germanici, l. ii. p. 2, No. 261, 262, 280-283. Yet some
vestiges of these pecuniary compositions for murder have been traced in
Germany as late as the sixteenth century.]

The civil and military professions, which had been separated by
Constantine, were again united by the Barbarians. The harsh sound of the
Teutonic appellations was mollified into the Latin titles of Duke,
of Count, or of Praefect; and the same officer assumed, within his
district, the command of the troops, and the administration of justice.
[77] But the fierce and illiterate chieftain was seldom qualified to
discharge the duties of a judge, which required all the faculties of a
philosophic mind, laboriously cultivated by experience and study; and
his rude ignorance was compelled to embrace some simple, and visible,
methods of ascertaining the cause of justice. In every religion, the
Deity has been invoked to confirm the truth, or to punish the falsehood
of human testimony; but this powerful instrument was misapplied and
abused by the simplicity of the German legislators. The party accused
might justify his innocence, by producing before their tribunal a number
of friendly witnesses, who solemnly declared their belief, or assurance,
that he was not guilty. According to the weight of the charge, this
legal number of compurgators was multiplied; seventy-two voices were
required to absolve an incendiary or assassin: and when the chastity
of a queen of France was suspected, three hundred gallant nobles swore,
without hesitation, that the infant prince had been actually begotten by
her deceased husband. [78] The sin and scandal of manifest and frequent
perjuries engaged the magistrates to remove these dangerous temptations;
and to supply the defects of human testimony by the famous experiments
of fire and water. These extraordinary trials were so capriciously
contrived, that, in some cases, guilt, and innocence in others, could
not be proved without the interposition of a miracle. Such miracles were
really provided by fraud and credulity; the most intricate causes
were determined by this easy and infallible method, and the turbulent
Barbarians, who might have disdained the sentence of the magistrate,
submissively acquiesced in the judgment of God. [79]

[Footnote 77: The whole subject of the Germanic judges, and their
jurisdiction, is copiously treated by Heineccius, (Element. Jur. Germ.
l. iii. No. 1-72.) I cannot find any proof that, under the Merovingian
race, the scabini, or assessors, were chosen by the people. * Note: The
question of the scabini is treated at considerable length by Savigny. He
questions the existence of the scabini anterior to Charlemagne. Before
this time the decision was by an open court of the freemen, the boni
Romische Recht, vol. i. p. 195. et seq.--M.]

[Footnote 78: Gregor. Turon. l. viii. c. 9, in tom. ii. p. 316.
Montesquieu observes, (Esprit des Loix. l. xxviii. c. 13,) that the
Salic law did not admit these negative proofs so universally established
in the Barbaric codes. Yet this obscure concubine (Fredegundis,) who
became the wife of the grandson of Clovis, must have followed the Salic
law.]

[Footnote 79: Muratori, in the Antiquities of Italy, has given two
Dissertations (xxxvii. xxxix.) on the judgments of God. It was expected
that fire would not burn the innocent; and that the pure element of
water would not allow the guilty to sink into its bosom.]

But the trials by single combat gradually obtained superior credit and
authority, among a warlike people, who could not believe that a brave
man deserved to suffer, or that a coward deserved to live. [80] Both
in civil and criminal proceedings, the plaintiff, or accuser, the
defendant, or even the witness, were exposed to mortal challenge from
the antagonist who was destitute of legal proofs; and it was incumbent
on them either to desert their cause, or publicly to maintain their
honor, in the lists of battle. They fought either on foot, or on
horseback, according to the custom of their nation; [81] and the
decision of the sword, or lance, was ratified by the sanction of Heaven,
of the judge, and of the people. This sanguinary law was introduced
into Gaul by the Burgundians; and their legislator Gundobald [82]
condescended to answer the complaints and objections of his subject
Avitus. "Is it not true," said the king of Burgundy to the bishop, "that
the event of national wars, and private combats, is directed by the
judgment of God; and that his providence awards the victory to the
juster cause?" By such prevailing arguments, the absurd and cruel
practice of judicial duels, which had been peculiar to some tribes of
Germany, was propagated and established in all the monarchies of Europe,
from Sicily to the Baltic. At the end of ten centuries, the reign
of legal violence was not totally extinguished; and the ineffectual
censures of saints, of popes, and of synods, may seem to prove, that
the influence of superstition is weakened by its unnatural alliance with
reason and humanity. The tribunals were stained with the blood, perhaps,
of innocent and respectable citizens; the law, which now favors the
rich, then yielded to the strong; and the old, the feeble, and the
infirm, were condemned, either to renounce their fairest claims and
possessions, to sustain the dangers of an unequal conflict, [83] or
to trust the doubtful aid of a mercenary champion. This oppressive
jurisprudence was imposed on the provincials of Gaul, who complained
of any injuries in their persons and property. Whatever might be the
strength, or courage, of individuals, the victorious Barbarians excelled
in the love and exercise of arms; and the vanquished Roman was unjustly
summoned to repeat, in his own person, the bloody contest which had been
already decided against his country. [84]

[Footnote 80: Montesquieu (Esprit des Loix, l. xxviii. c. 17) has
condescended to explain and excuse "la maniere de penser de nos peres,"
on the subject of judicial combats. He follows this strange institution
from the age of Gundobald to that of St. Lewis; and the philosopher is
some times lost in the legal antiquarian.]

[Footnote 81: In a memorable duel at Aix-la-Chapelle, (A.D. 820,) before
the emperor Lewis the Pious, his biographer observes, secundum legem
propriam, utpote quia uterque Gothus erat, equestri pugna est, (Vit.
Lud. Pii, c. 33, in tom. vi. p. 103.) Ermoldus Nigellus, (l. iii.
543-628, in tom. vi. p. 48-50,) who describes the duel, admires the ars
nova of fighting on horseback, which was unknown to the Franks.]

[Footnote 82: In his original edict, published at Lyons, (A.D. 501,)
establishes and justifies the use of judicial combat, (Les Burgund. tit.
xlv. in tom. ii. p. 267, 268.) Three hundred years afterwards, Agobard,
bishop of Lyons, solicited Lewis the Pious to abolish the law of an
Arian tyrant, (in tom. vi. p. 356-358.) He relates the conversation of
Gundobald and Avitus.]

[Footnote 83: "Accidit, (says Agobard,) ut non solum valentes viribus,
sed etiam infirmi et senes lacessantur ad pugnam, etiam pro vilissimis
rebus. Quibus foralibus certaminibus contingunt homicidia injusta; et
crudeles ac perversi eventus judiciorum." Like a prudent rhetorician, he
suppresses the legal privilege of hiring champions.]

[Footnote 84: Montesquieu, (Esprit des Loix, xxviii. c. 14,) who
understands why the judicial combat was admitted by the Burgundians,
Ripuarians, Alemanni, Bavarians, Lombards, Thuringians, Frisons, and
Saxons, is satisfied (and Agobard seems to countenance the assertion)
that it was not allowed by the Salic law. Yet the same custom, at least
in case of treason, is mentioned by Ermoldus, Nigellus (l. iii. 543, in
tom. vi. p. 48,) and the anonymous biographer of Lewis the Pious, (c.
46, in tom. vi. p. 112,) as the "mos antiquus Francorum, more Francis
solito," &c., expressions too general to exclude the noblest of their
tribes.]

A devouring host of one hundred and twenty thousand Germans had formerly
passed the Rhine under the command of Ariovistus. One third part of
the fertile lands of the Sequani was appropriated to their use; and the
conqueror soon repeated his oppressive demand of another third, for the
accommodation of a new colony of twenty-four thousand Barbarians, whom
he had invited to share the rich harvest of Gaul. [85] At the distance
of five hundred years, the Visigoths and Burgundians, who revenged the
defeat of Ariovistus, usurped the same unequal proportion of two thirds
of the subject lands. But this distribution, instead of spreading over
the province, may be reasonably confined to the peculiar districts where
the victorious people had been planted by their own choice, or by the
policy of their leader. In these districts, each Barbarian was connected
by the ties of hospitality with some Roman provincial. To this unwelcome
guest, the proprietor was compelled to abandon two thirds of his
patrimony, but the German, a shepherd and a hunter, might sometimes
content himself with a spacious range of wood and pasture, and resign
the smallest, though most valuable, portion, to the toil of the
industrious husbandman. [86] The silence of ancient and authentic
testimony has encouraged an opinion, that the rapine of the Franks was
not moderated, or disguised, by the forms of a legal division; that
they dispersed themselves over the provinces of Gaul, without order or
control; and that each victorious robber, according to his wants, his
avarice, and his strength, measured with his sword the extent of his new
inheritance. At a distance from their sovereign, the Barbarians might
indeed be tempted to exercise such arbitrary depredation; but the firm
and artful policy of Clovis must curb a licentious spirit, which would
aggravate the misery of the vanquished, whilst it corrupted the union
and discipline of the conquerors. [861] The memorable vase of Soissons
is a monument and a pledge of the regular distribution of the Gallic
spoils. It was the duty and the interest of Clovis to provide rewards
for a successful army, settlements for a numerous people; without
inflicting any wanton or superfluous injuries on the loyal Catholics of
Gaul. The ample fund, which he might lawfully acquire, of the Imperial
patrimony, vacant lands, and Gothic usurpations, would diminish the
cruel necessity of seizure and confiscation, and the humble provincials
would more patiently acquiesce in the equal and regular distribution of
their loss. [87]

[Footnote 85: Caesar de Bell. Gall. l. i. c. 31, in tom. i. p. 213.]

[Footnote 86: The obscure hints of a division of lands occasionally
scattered in the laws of the Burgundians, (tit. liv. No. 1, 2, in tom.
iv. p. 271, 272,) and Visigoths, (l. x. tit. i. No. 8, 9, 16, in
tom. iv. p. 428, 429, 430,) are skillfully explained by the president
Montesquieu, (Esprit des Loix, l. xxx. c. 7, 8, 9.) I shall only add,
that among the Goths, the division seems to have been ascertained by the
judgment of the neighborhood, that the Barbarians frequently usurped the
remaining third; and that the Romans might recover their right, unless
they were barred by a prescription of fifty years.]

[Footnote 861: Sismondi (Hist des Francais, vol. i. p. 197) observes,
they were not a conquering people, who had emigrated with their
families, like the Goths or Burgundians. The women, the children, the
old, had not followed Clovis: they remained in their ancient possessions
on the Waal and the Rhine. The adventurers alone had formed the invading
force, and they always considered themselves as an army, not as a
colony. Hence their laws retained no traces of the partition of the
Roman properties. It is curious to observe the recoil from the national
vanity of the French historians of the last century. M. Sismondi
compares the position of the Franks with regard to the conquered people
with that of the Dey of Algiers and his corsair troops to the peaceful
inhabitants of that province: M. Thierry (Lettres sur l'Histoire de
France, p. 117) with that of the Turks towards the Raias or Phanariotes,
the mass of the Greeks.--M.]

[Footnote 87: It is singular enough that the president de Montesquieu
(Esprit des Loix, l. xxx. c. 7) and the Abbe de Mably (Observations, tom
i. p. 21, 22) agree in this strange supposition of arbitrary and private
rapine. The Count de Boulainvilliers (Etat de la France, tom. i. p.
22, 23) shows a strong understanding through a cloud of ignorance and
prejudice. Note: Sismondi supposes that the Barbarians, if a farm were
conveniently situated, would show no great respect for the laws of
property; but in general there would have been vacant land enough for
the lots assigned to old or worn-out warriors, (Hist. des Francais, vol.
i. p. 196.)--M.]

The wealth of the Merovingian princes consisted in their extensive
domain. After the conquest of Gaul, they still delighted in the rustic
simplicity of their ancestors; the cities were abandoned to solitude
and decay; and their coins, their charters, and their synods, are still
inscribed with the names of the villas, or rural palaces, in which they
successively resided.

One hundred and sixty of these palaces, a title which need not excite
any unseasonable ideas of art or luxury, were scattered through the
provinces of their kingdom; and if some might claim the honors of a
fortress, the far greater part could be esteemed only in the light of
profitable farms. The mansion of the long-haired kings was surrounded
with convenient yards and stables, for the cattle and the poultry;
the garden was planted with useful vegetables; the various trades, the
labors of agriculture, and even the arts of hunting and fishing, were
exercised by servile hands for the emolument of the sovereign;
his magazines were filled with corn and wine, either for sale or
consumption; and the whole administration was conducted by the strictest
maxims of private economy. [88] This ample patrimony was appropriated to
supply the hospitable plenty of Clovis and his successors; and to reward
the fidelity of their brave companions who, both in peace and war,
were devoted to their persona service. Instead of a horse, or a suit of
armor, each companion, according to his rank, or merit, or favor, was
invested with a benefice, the primitive name, and most simple form, of
the feudal possessions. These gifts might be resumed at the pleasure of
the sovereign; and his feeble prerogative derived some support from
the influence of his liberality. [881] But this dependent tenure was
gradually abolished [89] by the independent and rapacious nobles
of France, who established the perpetual property, and hereditary
succession, of their benefices; a revolution salutary to the earth,
which had been injured, or neglected, by its precarious masters. [90]
Besides these royal and beneficiary estates, a large proportion had been
assigned, in the division of Gaul, of allodial and Salic lands: they
were exempt from tribute, and the Salic lands were equally shared among
the male descendants of the Franks. [91]

[Footnote 88: See the rustic edict, or rather code, of Charlemagne,
which contains seventy distinct and minute regulations of that great
monarch (in tom. v. p. 652-657.) He requires an account of the horns and
skins of the goats, allows his fish to be sold, and carefully directs,
that the larger villas (Capitaneoe) shall maintain one hundred hens and
thirty geese; and the smaller (Mansionales) fifty hens and twelve geese.
Mabillon (de Re Diplomatica) has investigated the names, the number, and
the situation of the Merovingian villas.]

[Footnote 881: The resumption of benefices at the pleasure of the
sovereign, (the general theory down to his time,) is ably contested by
Mr. Hallam; "for this resumption some delinquency must be imputed to the
vassal." Middle Ages, vol. i. p. 162. The reader will be interested by
the singular analogies with the beneficial and feudal system of Europe
in a remote part of the world, indicated by Col. Tod in his splendid
work on Raja'sthan, vol. ii p. 129, &c.--M.]

[Footnote 89: From a passage of the Burgundian law (tit. i. No. 4, in
tom. iv. p. 257) it is evident, that a deserving son might expect to
hold the lands which his father had received from the royal bounty of
Gundobald. The Burgundians would firmly maintain their privilege, and
their example might encourage the Beneficiaries of France.]

[Footnote 90: The revolutions of the benefices and fiefs are clearly
fixed by the Abbe de Mably. His accurate distinction of times gives him
a merit to which even Montesquieu is a stranger.]

[Footnote 91: See the Salic law, (tit. lxii. in tom. iv. p. 156.) The
origin and nature of these Salic lands, which, in times of ignorance,
were perfectly understood, now perplex our most learned and sagacious
critics. * Note: No solution seems more probable, than that the ancient
lawgivers of the Salic Franks prohibited females from inheriting
the lands assigned to the nation, upon its conquest of Gaul, both
in compliance with their ancient usages, and in order to secure the
military service of every proprietor. But lands subsequently acquired
by purchase or other means, though equally bound to the public defence,
were relieved from the severity of this rule, and presumed not to belong
to the class of Sallic. Hallam's Middle Ages, vol. i. p. 145. Compare
Sismondi, vol. i. p. 196.--M.]

In the bloody discord and silent decay of the Merovingian line, a new
order of tyrants arose in the provinces, who, under the appellation of
Seniors, or Lords, usurped a right to govern, and a license to oppress,
the subjects of their peculiar territory. Their ambition might be
checked by the hostile resistance of an equal: but the laws were
extinguished; and the sacrilegious Barbarians, who dared to provoke the
vengeance of a saint or bishop, [92] would seldom respect the landmarks
of a profane and defenceless neighbor. The common or public rights of
nature, such as they had always been deemed by the Roman jurisprudence,
[93] were severely restrained by the German conquerors, whose amusement,
or rather passion, was the exercise of hunting. The vague dominion which
Man has assumed over the wild inhabitants of the earth, the air, and the
waters, was confined to some fortunate individuals of the human species.
Gaul was again overspread with woods; and the animals, who were reserved
for the use or pleasure of the lord, might ravage with impunity the
fields of his industrious vassals. The chase was the sacred privilege
of the nobles and their domestic servants. Plebeian transgressors were
legally chastised with stripes and imprisonment; [94] but in an age
which admitted a slight composition for the life of a citizen, it was a
capital crime to destroy a stag or a wild bull within the precincts of
the royal forests. [95]

[Footnote 92: Many of the two hundred and six miracles of St. Martin
(Greg Turon. in Maxima Bibliotheca Patrum, tom. xi. p. 896-932) were
repeatedly performed to punish sacrilege. Audite haec omnes (exclaims
the bishop of Tours) protestatem habentes, after relating, how some
horses ran mad, that had been turned into a sacred meadow.]

king of Burgundy, was stoned to death, (Greg. Turon. l. x. c. 10, in
tom. ii. p. 369.) John of Salisbury (Policrat. l. i. c. 4) asserts the
rights of nature, and exposes the cruel practice of the twelfth century.
See Heineccius, Elem. Jur. Germ. l. ii. p. 1, No. 51-57.]

According to the maxims of ancient war, the conqueror became the
lawful master of the enemy whom he had subdued and spared: [96] and the
fruitful cause of personal slavery, which had been almost suppressed by
the peaceful sovereignty of Rome, was again revived and multiplied by
the perpetual hostilities of the independent Barbarians. The Goth, the
Burgundian, or the Frank, who returned from a successful expedition,
dragged after him a long train of sheep, of oxen, and of human captives,
whom he treated with the same brutal contempt. The youths of an elegant
form and an ingenuous aspect were set apart for the domestic service; a
doubtful situation, which alternately exposed them to the favorable or
cruel impulse of passion. The useful mechanics and servants (smiths,
carpenters, tailors, shoemakers, cooks, gardeners, dyers, and workmen
in gold and silver, &c.) employed their skill for the use, or profit,
of their master. But the Roman captives, who were destitute of art, but
capable of labor, were condemned, without regard to their former rank,
to tend the cattle and cultivate the lands of the Barbarians. The number
of the hereditary bondsmen, who were attached to the Gallic estates, was
continually increased by new supplies; and the servile people, according
to the situation and temper of their lords, was sometimes raised by
precarious indulgence, and more frequently depressed by capricious
despotism. [97] An absolute power of life and death was exercised by
these lords; and when they married their daughters, a train of useful
servants, chained on the wagons to prevent their escape, was sent as a
nuptial present into a distant country. [98] The majesty of the Roman
laws protected the liberty of each citizen, against the rash effects of
his own distress or despair. But the subjects of the Merovingian kings
might alienate their personal freedom; and this act of legal suicide,
which was familiarly practised, is expressed in terms most disgraceful
and afflicting to the dignity of human nature. [99] The example of the
poor, who purchased life by the sacrifice of all that can render life
desirable, was gradually imitated by the feeble and the devout, who, in
times of public disorder, pusillanimously crowded to shelter themselves
under the battlements of a powerful chief, and around the shrine of
a popular saint. Their submission was accepted by these temporal or
spiritual patrons; and the hasty transaction irrecoverably fixed their
own condition, and that of their latest posterity. From the reign of
Clovis, during five successive centuries, the laws and manners of Gaul
uniformly tended to promote the increase, and to confirm the duration,
of personal servitude. Time and violence almost obliterated the
intermediate ranks of society; and left an obscure and narrow interval
between the noble and the slave. This arbitrary and recent division has
been transformed by pride and prejudice into a national distinction,
universally established by the arms and the laws of the Merovingians.
The nobles, who claimed their genuine or fabulous descent from the
independent and victorious Franks, have asserted and abused the
indefeasible right of conquest over a prostrate crowd of slaves and
plebeians, to whom they imputed the imaginary disgrace of Gallic or
Roman extraction.

[Footnote 96: The custom of enslaving prisoners of war was totally
extinguished in the thirteenth century, by the prevailing influence of
Christianity; but it might be proved, from frequent passages of Gregory
of Tours, &c., that it was practised, without censure, under the
Merovingian race; and even Grotius himself, (de Jure Belli et Pacis
l. iii. c. 7,) as well as his commentator Barbeyrac, have labored to
reconcile it with the laws of nature and reason.]

[Footnote 97: The state, professions, &c., of the German, Italian, and
Gallic slaves, during the middle ages, are explained by Heineccius,
(Element Jur. Germ. l. i. No. 28-47,) Muratori, (Dissertat. xiv. xv.,)
Ducange, (Gloss. sub voce Servi,) and the Abbe de Mably, (Observations,
tom. ii. p. 3, &c., p. 237, &c.) Note: Compare Hallam, vol. i. p.
216.--M.]

[Footnote 98: Gregory of Tours (l. vi. c. 45, in tom. ii. p. 289)
relates a memorable example, in which Chilperic only abused the private
rights of a master. Many families which belonged to his domus fiscales
in the neighborhood of Paris, were forcibly sent away into Spain.]

disciplinam ponere; vel venumdare, aut quod vobis placuerit de me

Lindenbrogius, (p. 559,) and that of Anjou, (p. 565,) are to the same
effect Gregory of Tours (l. vii. c. 45, in tom. ii. p. 311) speak of
many person who sold themselves for bread, in a great famine.]

The general state and revolutions of France, a name which was imposed
by the conquerors, may be illustrated by the particular example of
a province, a diocese, or a senatorial family. Auvergne had formerly
maintained a just preeminence among the independent states and cities
of Gaul. The brave and numerous inhabitants displayed a singular trophy;
the sword of Caesar himself, which he had lost when he was repulsed
before the walls of Gergovia. [100] As the common offspring of Troy,
they claimed a fraternal alliance with the Romans; [101] and if each
province had imitated the courage and loyalty of Auvergne, the fall of
the Western empire might have been prevented or delayed. They firmly
maintained the fidelity which they had reluctantly sworn to the
Visigoths, out when their bravest nobles had fallen in the battle of
Poitiers, they accepted, without resistance, a victorious and Catholic
sovereign. This easy and valuable conquest was achieved and possessed
by Theodoric, the eldest son of Clovis: but the remote province was
separated from his Austrasian dominions, by the intermediate kingdoms of
Soissons, Paris, and Orleans, which formed, after their father's death,
the inheritance of his three brothers. The king of Paris, Childebert,
was tempted by the neighborhood and beauty of Auvergne. [102] The
Upper country, which rises towards the south into the mountains of the
Cevennes, presented a rich and various prospect of woods and pastures;
the sides of the hills were clothed with vines; and each eminence was
crowned with a villa or castle. In the Lower Auvergne, the River
Allier flows through the fair and spacious plain of Limagne; and the
inexhaustible fertility of the soil supplied, and still supplies,
without any interval of repose, the constant repetition of the same
harvests. [103] On the false report, that their lawful sovereign had
been slain in Germany, the city and diocese of Auvergne were betrayed
by the grandson of Sidonius Apollinaris. Childebert enjoyed this
clandestine victory; and the free subjects of Theodoric threatened to
desert his standard, if he indulged his private resentment, while the
nation was engaged in the Burgundian war. But the Franks of Austrasia
soon yielded to the persuasive eloquence of their king. "Follow me,"
said Theodoric, "into Auvergne; I will lead you into a province, where
you may acquire gold, silver, slaves, cattle, and precious apparel,
to the full extent of your wishes. I repeat my promise; I give you the
people and their wealth as your prey; and you may transport them at
pleasure into your own country." By the execution of this promise,
Theodoric justly forfeited the allegiance of a people whom he devoted
to destruction. His troops, reenforced by the fiercest Barbarians of
Germany, [104] spread desolation over the fruitful face of Auvergne;
and two places only, a strong castle and a holy shrine, were saved or
redeemed from their licentious fury. The castle of Meroliac [105] was
seated on a lofty rock, which rose a hundred feet above the surface of
the plain; and a large reservoir of fresh water was enclosed, with some
arable lands, within the circle of its fortifications. The Franks beheld
with envy and despair this impregnable fortress; but they surprised a
party of fifty stragglers; and, as they were oppressed by the number
of their captives, they fixed, at a trifling ransom, the alternative of
life or death for these wretched victims, whom the cruel Baroarians were
prepared to massacre on the refusal of the garrison. Another detachment
penetrated as far as Brivas, or Brioude, where the inhabitants, with
their valuable effects, had taken refuge in the sanctuary of St. Julian.
The doors of the church resisted the assault; but a daring soldier
entered through a window of the choir, and opened a passage to his
companions. The clergy and people, the sacred and the profane spoils,
were rudely torn from the altar; and the sacrilegious division was made
at a small distance from the town of Brioude. But this act of impiety
was severely chastised by the devout son of Clovis. He punished with
death the most atrocious offenders; left their secret accomplices to the
vengeance of St. Julian; released the captives; restored the plunder;
and extended the rights of sanctuary five miles round the sepulchre of
the holy martyr. [106]

[Footnote 100: When Caesar saw it, he laughed, (Plutarch. in Caesar. in
tom. i. p. 409:) yet he relates his unsuccessful siege of Gergovia with
less frankness than we might expect from a great man to whom victory was
familiar. He acknowledges, however, that in one attack he lost forty-six
centurions and seven hundred men, (de Bell. Gallico, l. vi. c. 44-53, in
tom. i. p. 270-272.)]

fabulous pedigree.]

Clovis, had given Berry to Childebert, (Greg. Turon. l. iii. c. 12,

jocunditatis gratia refulgere dicitur, oculis cernere, (l. iii. c. p.

king of Paris made his entry into Clermen.]

ravages which his troops committed in the neighborhood of Paris.]

[Footnote 105: From the name and situation, the Benedictine editors
of Gregory of Tours (in tom. ii. p. 192) have fixed this fortress at
a place named Castel Merliac, two miles from Mauriac, in the Upper
Auvergne. In this description, I translate infra as if I read intra; the
two are perpetually confounded by Gregory, or his transcribed and the
sense must always decide.]

frequently betrays his extraordinary attention to his native country.]
