## Chapter XXIII: Reign Of Julian.--Part II.

The inclination of Julian might prefer the gods of Homer, and of the
Scipios, to the new faith, which his uncle had established in the Roman
empire; and in which he himself had been sanctified by the sacrament of
baptism. But, as a philosopher, it was incumbent on him to justify his
dissent from Christianity, which was supported by the number of its
converts, by the chain of prophecy, the splendor of or miracles, and the
weight of evidence. The elaborate work, [30] which he composed amidst
the preparations of the Persian war, contained the substance of those
arguments which he had long revolved in his mind. Some fragments have
been transcribed and preserved, by his adversary, the vehement Cyril
of Alexandria; [31] and they exhibit a very singular mixture of wit and
learning, of sophistry and fanaticism. The elegance of the style and the
rank of the author, recommended his writings to the public attention;
[32] and in the impious list of the enemies of Christianity, the
celebrated name of Porphyry was effaced by the superior merit or
reputation of Julian. The minds of the faithful were either seduced,
or scandalized, or alarmed; and the pagans, who sometimes presumed to
engage in the unequal dispute, derived, from the popular work of their
Imperial missionary, an inexhaustible supply of fallacious objections.
But in the assiduous prosecution of these theological studies, the
emperor of the Romans imbibed the illiberal prejudices and passions of a
polemic divine. He contracted an irrevocable obligation to maintain and
propagate his religious opinions; and whilst he secretly applauded the
strength and dexterity with which he wielded the weapons of
controversy, he was tempted to distrust the sincerity, or to despise
the understandings, of his antagonists, who could obstinately resist the
force of reason and eloquence.

[Footnote 30: Fabricius (Biblioth. Graec. l. v. c. viii, p. 88-90)
and Lardner (Heathen Testimonies, vol. iv. p. 44-47) have accurately
compiled all that can now be discovered of Julian's work against the
Christians.]

[Footnote 31: About seventy years after the death of Julian, he executed
a task which had been feebly attempted by Philip of Side, a prolix and
contemptible writer. Even the work of Cyril has not entirely satisfied
the most favorable judges; and the Abbe de la Bleterie (Preface a
l'Hist. de Jovien, p. 30, 32) wishes that some theologien philosophe (a
strange centaur) would undertake the refutation of Julian.]

[Footnote 32: Libanius, (Orat. Parental. c. lxxxvii. p. 313,) who has
been suspected of assisting his friend, prefers this divine vindication
(Orat. ix in necem Julian. p. 255, edit. Morel.) to the writings of
Porphyry. His judgment may be arraigned, (Socrates, l. iii. c. 23,) but
Libanius cannot be accused of flattery to a dead prince.]

The Christians, who beheld with horror and indignation the apostasy of
Julian, had much more to fear from his power than from his arguments.
The pagans, who were conscious of his fervent zeal, expected, perhaps
with impatience, that the flames of persecution should be immediately
kindled against the enemies of the gods; and that the ingenious malice
of Julian would invent some cruel refinements of death and torture which
had been unknown to the rude and inexperienced fury of his predecessors.
But the hopes, as well as the fears, of the religious factions were
apparently disappointed, by the prudent humanity of a prince, [33] who
was careful of his own fame, of the public peace, and of the rights of
mankind. Instructed by history and reflection, Julian was persuaded,
that if the diseases of the body may sometimes be cured by salutary
violence, neither steel nor fire can eradicate the erroneous opinions of
the mind. The reluctant victim may be dragged to the foot of the altar;
but the heart still abhors and disclaims the sacrilegious act of the
hand. Religious obstinacy is hardened and exasperated by oppression;
and, as soon as the persecution subsides, those who have yielded are
restored as penitents, and those who have resisted are honored as saints
and martyrs. If Julian adopted the unsuccessful cruelty of Diocletian
and his colleagues, he was sensible that he should stain his memory with
the name of a tyrant, and add new glories to the Catholic church,
which had derived strength and increase from the severity of the pagan
magistrates. Actuated by these motives, and apprehensive of disturbing
the repose of an unsettled reign, Julian surprised the world by an
edict, which was not unworthy of a statesman, or a philosopher. He
extended to all the inhabitants of the Roman world the benefits of a
free and equal toleration; and the only hardship which he inflicted on
the Christians, was to deprive them of the power of tormenting their
fellow-subjects, whom they stigmatized with the odious titles of
idolaters and heretics. The pagans received a gracious permission, or
rather an express order, to open All their temples; [34] and they were
at once delivered from the oppressive laws, and arbitrary vexations,
which they had sustained under the reign of Constantine, and of his
sons. At the same time the bishops and clergy, who had been banished
by the Arian monarch, were recalled from exile, and restored to their
respective churches; the Donatists, the Novatians, the Macedonians, the
Eunomians, and those who, with a more prosperous fortune, adhered to
the doctrine of the Council of Nice. Julian, who understood and derided
their theological disputes, invited to the palace the leaders of the
hostile sects, that he might enjoy the agreeable spectacle of their
furious encounters. The clamor of controversy sometimes provoked
the emperor to exclaim, "Hear me! the Franks have heard me, and the
Alemanni;" but he soon discovered that he was now engaged with more
obstinate and implacable enemies; and though he exerted the powers of
oratory to persuade them to live in concord, or at least in peace, he
was perfectly satisfied, before he dismissed them from his presence,
that he had nothing to dread from the union of the Christians. The
impartial Ammianus has ascribed this affected clemency to the desire
of fomenting the intestine divisions of the church, and the insidious
design of undermining the foundations of Christianity, was inseparably
connected with the zeal which Julian professed, to restore the ancient
religion of the empire. [35]

[Footnote 33: Libanius (Orat. Parent. c. lviii. p. 283, 284) has
eloquently explained the tolerating principles and conduct of his
Imperial friend. In a very remarkable epistle to the people of Bostra,
Julian himself (Epist. lii.) professes his moderation, and betrays his
zeal, which is acknowledged by Ammianus, and exposed by Gregory (Orat.
iii. p.72)]

[Footnote 34: In Greece the temples of Minerva were opened by his
express command, before the death of Constantius, (Liban. Orat. Parent.
c. 55, p. 280;) and Julian declares himself a Pagan in his public
manifesto to the Athenians. This unquestionable evidence may correct the
hasty assertion of Ammianus, who seems to suppose Constantinople to be
the place where he discovered his attachment to the gods]

[Footnote 35: Ammianus, xxii. 5. Sozomen, l. v. c. 5. Bestia moritur,

As soon as he ascended the throne, he assumed, according to the custom
of his predecessors, the character of supreme pontiff; not only as
the most honorable title of Imperial greatness, but as a sacred and
important office; the duties of which he was resolved to execute with
pious diligence. As the business of the state prevented the emperor from
joining every day in the public devotion of his subjects, he dedicated
a domestic chapel to his tutelar deity the Sun; his gardens were filled
with statues and altars of the gods; and each apartment of the palace
displaced the appearance of a magnificent temple. Every morning he
saluted the parent of light with a sacrifice; the blood of another
victim was shed at the moment when the Sun sunk below the horizon;
and the Moon, the Stars, and the Genii of the night received their
respective and seasonable honors from the indefatigable devotion of
Julian. On solemn festivals, he regularly visited the temple of the god
or goddess to whom the day was peculiarly consecrated, and endeavored to
excite the religion of the magistrates and people by the example of
his own zeal. Instead of maintaining the lofty state of a monarch,
distinguished by the splendor of his purple, and encompassed by
the golden shields of his guards, Julian solicited, with respectful
eagerness, the meanest offices which contributed to the worship of the
gods. Amidst the sacred but licentious crowd of priests, of inferior
ministers, and of female dancers, who were dedicated to the service of
the temple, it was the business of the emperor to bring the wood,
to blow the fire, to handle the knife, to slaughter the victim, and,
thrusting his bloody hands into the bowels of the expiring animal, to
draw forth the heart or liver, and to read, with the consummate skill of
an haruspex, imaginary signs of future events. The wisest of the Pagans
censured this extravagant superstition, which affected to despise the
restraints of prudence and decency. Under the reign of a prince, who
practised the rigid maxims of economy, the expense of religious worship
consumed a very large portion of the revenue a constant supply of the
scarcest and most beautiful birds was transported from distant climates,
to bleed on the altars of the gods; a hundred oxen were frequently
sacrificed by Julian on one and the same day; and it soon became a
popular jest, that if he should return with conquest from the Persian
war, the breed of horned cattle must infallibly be extinguished. Yet
this expense may appear inconsiderable, when it is compared with the
splendid presents which were offered either by the hand, or by order,
of the emperor, to all the celebrated places of devotion in the Roman
world; and with the sums allotted to repair and decorate the ancient
temples, which had suffered the silent decay of time, or the
recent injuries of Christian rapine. Encouraged by the example, the
exhortations, the liberality, of their pious sovereign, the cities and
families resumed the practice of their neglected ceremonies. "Every part
of the world," exclaims Libanius, with devout transport, "displayed
the triumph of religion; and the grateful prospect of flaming altars,
bleeding victims, the smoke of incense, and a solemn train of priests
and prophets, without fear and without danger. The sound of prayer and
of music was heard on the tops of the highest mountains; and the same
ox afforded a sacrifice for the gods, and a supper for their joyous
votaries." [36]

[Footnote 36: The restoration of the Pagan worship is described by
Julian, (Misopogon, p. 346,) Libanius, (Orat. Parent. c. 60, p.
286, 287, and Orat. Consular. ad Julian. p. 245, 246, edit. Morel.,)
Ammianus, (xxii. 12,) and Gregory Nazianzen, (Orat. iv. p. 121.)
These writers agree in the essential, and even minute, facts; but the
different lights in which they view the extreme devotion of Julian, are
expressive of the gradations of self-applause, passionate admiration,
mild reproof, and partial invective.]

But the genius and power of Julian were unequal to the enterprise of
restoring a religion which was destitute of theological principles, of
moral precepts, and of ecclesiastical discipline; which rapidly hastened
to decay and dissolution, and was not susceptible of any solid or
consistent reformation. The jurisdiction of the supreme pontiff, more
especially after that office had been united with the Imperial dignity,
comprehended the whole extent of the Roman empire. Julian named for his
vicars, in the several provinces, the priests and philosophers whom he
esteemed the best qualified to cooperate in the execution of his great
design; and his pastoral letters, [37] if we may use that name, still
represent a very curious sketch of his wishes and intentions. He
directs, that in every city the sacerdotal order should be composed,
without any distinction of birth and fortune, of those persons who were
the most conspicuous for the love of the gods, and of men. "If they
are guilty," continues he, "of any scandalous offence, they should be
censured or degraded by the superior pontiff; but as long as they retain
their rank, they are entitled to the respect of the magistrates and
people. Their humility may be shown in the plainness of their domestic
garb; their dignity, in the pomp of holy vestments. When they are
summoned in their turn to officiate before the altar, they ought not,
during the appointed number of days, to depart from the precincts of
the temple; nor should a single day be suffered to elapse, without
the prayers and the sacrifice, which they are obliged to offer for
the prosperity of the state, and of individuals. The exercise of their
sacred functions requires an immaculate purity, both of mind and body;
and even when they are dismissed from the temple to the occupations of
common life, it is incumbent on them to excel in decency and virtue the
rest of their fellow-citizens. The priest of the gods should never be
seen in theatres or taverns. His conversation should be chaste, his
diet temperate, his friends of honorable reputation; and if he sometimes
visits the Forum or the Palace, he should appear only as the advocate
of those who have vainly solicited either justice or mercy. His studies
should be suited to the sanctity of his profession. Licentious tales,
or comedies, or satires, must be banished from his library, which ought
solely to consist of historical or philosophical writings; of history,
which is founded in truth, and of philosophy, which is connected with
religion. The impious opinions of the Epicureans and sceptics deserve
his abhorrence and contempt; [38] but he should diligently study the
systems of Pythagoras, of Plato, and of the Stoics, which unanimously
teach that there are gods; that the world is governed by their
providence; that their goodness is the source of every temporal
blessing; and that they have prepared for the human soul a future state
of reward or punishment." The Imperial pontiff inculcates, in the most
persuasive language, the duties of benevolence and hospitality; exhorts
his inferior clergy to recommend the universal practice of those
virtues; promises to assist their indigence from the public treasury;
and declares his resolution of establishing hospitals in every city,
where the poor should be received without any invidious distinction
of country or of religion. Julian beheld with envy the wise and humane
regulations of the church; and he very frankly confesses his intention
to deprive the Christians of the applause, as well as advantage, which
they had acquired by the exclusive practice of charity and beneficence.
[39] The same spirit of imitation might dispose the emperor to adopt
several ecclesiastical institutions, the use and importance of which
were approved by the success of his enemies. But if these imaginary
plans of reformation had been realized, the forced and imperfect
copy would have been less beneficial to Paganism, than honorable to
Christianity. [40] The Gentiles, who peaceably followed the customs
of their ancestors, were rather surprised than pleased with the
introduction of foreign manners; and in the short period of his reign,
Julian had frequent occasions to complain of the want of fervor of his
own party. [41]

[Footnote 37: See Julian. Epistol. xlix. lxii. lxiii., and a long and
curious fragment, without beginning or end, (p. 288-305.) The supreme
pontiff derides the Mosaic history and the Christian discipline, prefers
the Greek poets to the Hebrew prophets, and palliates, with the skill of
a Jesuit the relative worship of images.]

[Footnote 38: The exultation of Julian (p. 301) that these impious sects
and even their writings, are extinguished, may be consistent enough with
the sacerdotal character; but it is unworthy of a philosopher to wish
that any opinions and arguments the most repugnant to his own should be
concealed from the knowledge of mankind.]

[Footnote 39: Yet he insinuates, that the Christians, under the pretence
of charity, inveigled children from their religion and parents, conveyed
them on shipboard, and devoted those victims to a life of poverty or
pervitude in a remote country, (p. 305.) Had the charge been proved it
was his duty, not to complain, but to punish.]

[Footnote 40: Gregory Nazianzen is facetious, ingenious, and
argumentative, (Orat. iii. p. 101, 102, &c.) He ridicules the folly of
such vain imitation; and amuses himself with inquiring, what lessons,
moral or theological, could be extracted from the Grecian fables.]

[Footnote 41: He accuses one of his pontiffs of a secret confederacy
with the Christian bishops and presbyters, (Epist. lxii.) &c. Epist.
lxiii.]

The enthusiasm of Julian prompted him to embrace the friends of Jupiter
as his personal friends and brethren; and though he partially overlooked
the merit of Christian constancy, he admired and rewarded the noble
perseverance of those Gentiles who had preferred the favor of the gods
to that of the emperor. [42] If they cultivated the literature, as well
as the religion, of the Greeks, they acquired an additional claim to the
friendship of Julian, who ranked the Muses in the number of his tutelar
deities. In the religion which he had adopted, piety and learning were
almost synonymous; [43] and a crowd of poets, of rhetoricians, and
of philosophers, hastened to the Imperial court, to occupy the vacant
places of the bishops, who had seduced the credulity of Constantius. His
successor esteemed the ties of common initiation as far more sacred than
those of consanguinity; he chose his favorites among the sages, who were
deeply skilled in the occult sciences of magic and divination; and every
impostor, who pretended to reveal the secrets of futurity, was assured
of enjoying the present hour in honor and affluence. [44] Among the
philosophers, Maximus obtained the most eminent rank in the friendship
of his royal disciple, who communicated, with unreserved confidence, his
actions, his sentiments, and his religious designs, during the anxious
suspense of the civil war. [45] As soon as Julian had taken possession
of the palace of Constantinople, he despatched an honorable and pressing
invitation to Maximus, who then resided at Sardes in Lydia, with
Chrysanthius, the associate of his art and studies. The prudent and
superstitious Chrysanthius refused to undertake a journey which showed
itself, according to the rules of divination, with the most threatening
and malignant aspect: but his companion, whose fanaticism was of a
bolder cast, persisted in his interrogations, till he had extorted from
the gods a seeming consent to his own wishes, and those of the emperor.
The journey of Maximus through the cities of Asia displayed the triumph
of philosophic vanity; and the magistrates vied with each other in
the honorable reception which they prepared for the friend of their
sovereign. Julian was pronouncing an oration before the senate, when
he was informed of the arrival of Maximus. The emperor immediately
interrupted his discourse, advanced to meet him, and after a tender
embrace, conducted him by the hand into the midst of the assembly; where
he publicly acknowledged the benefits which he had derived from the
instructions of the philosopher. Maximus, [46] who soon acquired the
confidence, and influenced the councils of Julian, was insensibly
corrupted by the temptations of a court. His dress became more splendid,
his demeanor more lofty, and he was exposed, under a succeeding reign,
to a disgraceful inquiry into the means by which the disciple of Plato
had accumulated, in the short duration of his favor, a very scandalous
proportion of wealth. Of the other philosophers and sophists, who were
invited to the Imperial residence by the choice of Julian, or by the
success of Maximus, few were able to preserve their innocence or
their reputation. The liberal gifts of money, lands, and houses, were
insufficient to satiate their rapacious avarice; and the indignation of
the people was justly excited by the remembrance of their abject poverty
and disinterested professions. The penetration of Julian could not
always be deceived: but he was unwilling to despise the characters of
those men whose talents deserved his esteem: he desired to escape the
double reproach of imprudence and inconstancy; and he was apprehensive
of degrading, in the eyes of the profane, the honor of letters and of
religion. [48]

[Footnote 42: He praises the fidelity of Callixene, priestess of Ceres,
who had been twice as constant as Penelope, and rewards her with the
priesthood of the Phrygian goddess at Pessinus, (Julian. Epist. xxi.) He
applauds the firmness of Sopater of Hierapolis, who had been repeatedly
pressed by Constantius and Gallus to apostatize, (Epist. xxvii p. 401.)]

[Footnote 43: Orat. Parent. c. 77, p. 202. The same sentiment is
frequently inculcated by Julian, Libanius, and the rest of their party.]

[Footnote 44: The curiosity and credulity of the emperor, who tried
every mode of divination, are fairly exposed by Ammianus, xxii. 12.]

[Footnote 45: Julian. Epist. xxxviii. Three other epistles, (xv. xvi.
xxxix.,) in the same style of friendship and confidence, are addressed
to the philosopher Maximus.]

[Footnote 46: Eunapius (in Maximo, p. 77, 78, 79, and in Chrysanthio, p.
147, 148) has minutely related these anecdotes, which he conceives to
be the most important events of the age. Yet he fairly confesses the
frailty of Maximus. His reception at Constantinople is described by
Libanius (Orat. Parent. c. 86, p. 301) and Ammianus, (xxii. 7.) * Note:
Eunapius wrote a continuation of the History of Dexippus. Some valuable
fragments of this work have been recovered by M. Mai, and reprinted in
Niebuhr's edition of the Byzantine Historians.--M.]

[Footnote 47: Chrysanthius, who had refused to quit Lydia, was created
high priest of the province. His cautious and temperate use of power
secured him after the revolution; and he lived in peace, while Maximus,
Priscus, &c., were persecuted by the Christian ministers. See the
adventures of those fanatic sophists, collected by Brucker, tom ii. p.
281-293.]

[Footnote 48: Sec Libanius (Orat. Parent. c. 101, 102, p. 324, 325,
326) and Eunapius, (Vit. Sophist. in Proaeresio, p. 126.) Some students,
whose expectations perhaps were groundless, or extravagant, retired in
disgust, (Greg. Naz. Orat. iv. p. 120.) It is strange that we should not
be able to contradict the title of one of Tillemont's chapters, (Hist.
des Empereurs, tom. iv. p. 960,) "La Cour de Julien est pleine de
philosphes et de gens perdus."]

The favor of Julian was almost equally divided between the Pagans,
who had firmly adhered to the worship of their ancestors, and the
Christians, who prudently embraced the religion of their sovereign. The
acquisition of new proselytes [49] gratified the ruling passions of his
soul, superstition and vanity; and he was heard to declare, with the
enthusiasm of a missionary, that if he could render each individual
richer than Midas, and every city greater than Babylon, he should not
esteem himself the benefactor of mankind, unless, at the same time,
he could reclaim his subjects from their impious revolt against the
immortal gods. [50] A prince who had studied human nature, and who
possessed the treasures of the Roman empire, could adapt his arguments,
his promises, and his rewards, to every order of Christians; [51] and
the merit of a seasonable conversion was allowed to supply the defects
of a candidate, or even to expiate the guilt of a criminal. As the army
is the most forcible engine of absolute power, Julian applied himself,
with peculiar diligence, to corrupt the religion of his troops,
without whose hearty concurrence every measure must be dangerous and
unsuccessful; and the natural temper of soldiers made this conquest as
easy as it was important. The legions of Gaul devoted themselves to the
faith, as well as to the fortunes, of their victorious leader; and even
before the death of Constantius, he had the satisfaction of announcing
to his friends, that they assisted with fervent devotion, and voracious
appetite, at the sacrifices, which were repeatedly offered in his camp,
of whole hecatombs of fat oxen. [52] The armies of the East, which
had been trained under the standard of the cross, and of Constantius,
required a more artful and expensive mode of persuasion. On the days
of solemn and public festivals, the emperor received the homage, and
rewarded the merit, of the troops. His throne of state was encircled
with the military ensigns of Rome and the republic; the holy name of
Christ was erased from the Labarum; and the symbols of war, of majesty,
and of pagan superstition, were so dexterously blended, that the
faithful subject incurred the guilt of idolatry, when he respectfully
saluted the person or image of his sovereign. The soldiers passed
successively in review; and each of them, before he received from
the hand of Julian a liberal donative, proportioned to his rank and
services, was required to cast a few grains of incense into the flame
which burnt upon the altar. Some Christian confessors might resist, and
others might repent; but the far greater number, allured by the prospect
of gold, and awed by the presence of the emperor, contracted the
criminal engagement; and their future perseverance in the worship of the
gods was enforced by every consideration of duty and of interest.

By the frequent repetition of these arts, and at the expense of sums
which would have purchased the service of half the nations of Scythia,
Julian gradually acquired for his troops the imaginary protection of
the gods, and for himself the firm and effectual support of the Roman
legions. [53] It is indeed more than probable, that the restoration and
encouragement of Paganism revealed a multitude of pretended Christians,
who, from motives of temporal advantage, had acquiesced in the religion
of the former reign; and who afterwards returned, with the same
flexibility of conscience, to the faith which was professed by the
successors of Julian.

[Footnote 49: Under the reign of Lewis XIV. his subjects of every rank
aspired to the glorious title of Convertisseur, expressive of their
zea and success in making proselytes. The word and the idea are growing
obsolete in France may they never be introduced into England.]

[Footnote 50: See the strong expressions of Libanius, which were
probably those of Julian himself, (Orat. Parent. c. 59, p. 285.)]

[Footnote 51: When Gregory Nazianzen (Orat. x. p. 167) is desirous to
magnify the Christian firmness of his brother Caesarius, physician to
the Imperial court, he owns that Caesarius disputed with a formidable
adversary. In his invectives he scarcely allows any share of wit or
courage to the apostate.]

[Footnote 52: Julian, Epist. xxxviii. Ammianus, xxii. 12. Adeo ut
in dies paene singulos milites carnis distentiore sagina victitantes
incultius, potusque aviditate correpti, humeris impositi transeuntium
per plateas, ex publicis aedibus..... ad sua diversoria portarentur. The
devout prince and the indignant historian describe the same scene;
and in Illyricum or Antioch, similar causes must have produced similar
effects.]

[Footnote 53: Gregory (Orat. iii. p. 74, 75, 83-86) and Libanius, (Orat.
Parent. c. lxxxi. lxxxii. p. 307, 308,). The sophist owns and justifies
the expense of these military conversions.]

While the devout monarch incessantly labored to restore and propagate
the religion of his ancestors, he embraced the extraordinary design
of rebuilding the temple of Jerusalem. In a public epistle [54] to the
nation or community of the Jews, dispersed through the provinces, he
pities their misfortunes, condemns their oppressors, praises their
constancy, declares himself their gracious protector, and expresses
a pious hope, that after his return from the Persian war, he may be
permitted to pay his grateful vows to the Almighty in his holy city
of Jerusalem. The blind superstition, and abject slavery, of those
unfortunate exiles, must excite the contempt of a philosophic emperor;
but they deserved the friendship of Julian, by their implacable hatred
of the Christian name. The barren synagogue abhorred and envied the
fecundity of the rebellious church; the power of the Jews was not equal
to their malice; but their gravest rabbis approved the private murder
of an apostate; [55] and their seditious clamors had often awakened the
indolence of the Pagan magistrates. Under the reign of Constantine,
the Jews became the subjects of their revolted children nor was it long
before they experienced the bitterness of domestic tyranny. The civil
immunities which had been granted, or confirmed, by Severus, were
gradually repealed by the Christian princes; and a rash tumult, excited
by the Jews of Palestine, [56] seemed to justify the lucrative modes of
oppression which were invented by the bishops and eunuchs of the
court of Constantius. The Jewish patriarch, who was still permitted to
exercise a precarious jurisdiction, held his residence at Tiberias; [57]
and the neighboring cities of Palestine were filled with the remains
of a people who fondly adhered to the promised land. But the edict of
Hadrian was renewed and enforced; and they viewed from afar the walls of
the holy city, which were profaned in their eyes by the triumph of the
cross and the devotion of the Christians. [58]

[Footnote 54: Julian's epistle (xxv.) is addressed to the community of
the Jews. Aldus (Venet. 1499) has branded it with an; but this stigma
is justly removed by the subsequent editors, Petavius and Spanheim. This
epistle is mentioned by Sozomen, (l. v. c. 22,) and the purport of it
is confirmed by Gregory, (Orat. iv. p. 111.) and by Julian himself
(Fragment. p. 295.)]

foundation. The judgment of zeal is explained by Marsham (Canon. Chron.
