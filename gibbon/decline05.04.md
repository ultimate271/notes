## Chapter XLIX: Conquest Of Italy By The Franks.--Part IV.

It was after the Nycene synod, and under the reign of the pious Irene,
that the popes consummated the separation of Rome and Italy, by the
translation of the empire to the less orthodox Charlemagne. They were
compelled to choose between the rival nations: religion was not the sole
motive of their choice; and while they dissembled the failings of
their friends, they beheld, with reluctance and suspicion, the Catholic
virtues of their foes. The difference of language and manners had
perpetuated the enmity of the two capitals; and they were alienated from
each other by the hostile opposition of seventy years. In that schism
the Romans had tasted of freedom, and the popes of sovereignty: their
submission would have exposed them to the revenge of a jealous tyrant;
and the revolution of Italy had betrayed the impotence, as well as the
tyranny, of the Byzantine court. The Greek emperors had restored the
images, but they had not restored the Calabrian estates [85] and the
Illyrian diocese, [86] which the Iconociasts had torn away from the
successors of St. Peter; and Pope Adrian threatens them with a sentence
of excommunication unless they speedily abjure this practical heresy.
[87] The Greeks were now orthodox; but their religion might be tainted
by the breath of the reigning monarch: the Franks were now contumacious;
but a discerning eye might discern their approaching conversion, from
the use, to the adoration, of images. The name of Charlemagne was
stained by the polemic acrimony of his scribes; but the conqueror
himself conformed, with the temper of a statesman, to the various
practice of France and Italy. In his four pilgrimages or visits to the
Vatican, he embraced the popes in the communion of friendship and
piety; knelt before the tomb, and consequently before the image, of the
apostle; and joined, without scruple, in all the prayers and processions
of the Roman liturgy. Would prudence or gratitude allow the pontiffs to
renounce their benefactor? Had they a right to alienate his gift of the
Exarchate? Had they power to abolish his government of Rome? The title
of patrician was below the merit and greatness of Charlemagne; and
it was only by reviving the Western empire that they could pay their
obligations or secure their establishment. By this decisive measure they
would finally eradicate the claims of the Greeks; from the debasement
of a provincial town, the majesty of Rome would be restored: the Latin
Christians would be united, under a supreme head, in their ancient
metropolis; and the conquerors of the West would receive their crown
from the successors of St. Peter. The Roman church would acquire
a zealous and respectable advocate; and, under the shadow of the
Carlovingian power, the bishop might exercise, with honor and safety,
the government of the city. [88]

[Footnote 85: Theophanes (p. 343) specifies those of Sicily and
Calabria, which yielded an annual rent of three talents and a half of
gold, (perhaps 7000 L. sterling.) Liutprand more pompously enumerates the
patrimonies of the Roman church in Greece, Judaea, Persia, Mesopotamia
Babylonia, Egypt, and Libya, which were detained by the injustice of the
Greek emperor, (Legat. ad Nicephorum, in Script. Rerum Italica rum, tom.
ii. pars i. p. 481.)]

[Footnote 86: The great diocese of the Eastern Illyricum, with Apulia,
Calabria, and Sicily, (Thomassin, Discipline de l'Eglise, tom. i. p.
145: ) by the confession of the Greeks, the patriarch of Constantinople
had detached from Rome the metropolitans of Thessalonica, Athens
Corinth, Nicopolis, and Patrae, (Luc. Holsten. Geograph. Sacra, p. 22)
and his spiritual conquests extended to Naples and Amalphi (Istoria
Civile di Napoli, tom. i. p. 517-524, Pagi, A. D 780, No. 11.)]

[Footnote 87: In hoc ostenditur, quia ex uno capitulo ab errore
reversis, in aliis duobus, in eodem (was it the same?) permaneant
errore.... de diocessi S. R. E. seu de patrimoniis iterum increpantes
commonemus, ut si ea restituere noluerit hereticum eum pro hujusmodi
errore perseverantia decernemus, (Epist. Hadrian. Papae ad Carolum
Magnum, in Concil. tom. viii. p. 1598;) to which he adds a reason, most
directly opposite to his conduct, that he preferred the salvation of
souls and rule of faith to the goods of this transitory world.]

[Footnote 88: Fontanini considers the emperors as no more than the
advocates of the church, (advocatus et defensor S. R. E. See Ducange,
Gloss Lat. tom. i. p. 297.) His antagonist Muratori reduces the popes to
be no more than the exarchs of the emperor. In the more equitable view
of Mosheim, (Institut. Hist. Eccles. p. 264, 265,) they held Rome under
the empire as the most honorable species of fief or benefice--premuntur
nocte caliginosa!]

Before the ruin of Paganism in Rome, the competition for a wealthy
bishopric had often been productive of tumult and bloodshed. The people
was less numerous, but the times were more savage, the prize more
important, and the chair of St. Peter was fiercely disputed by the
leading ecclesiastics who aspired to the rank of sovereign. The reign of
Adrian the First [89] surpasses the measure of past or succeeding ages;
[90] the walls of Rome, the sacred patrimony, the ruin of the Lombards,
and the friendship of Charlemagne, were the trophies of his fame: he
secretly edified the throne of his successors, and displayed in a narrow
space the virtues of a great prince. His memory was revered; but in the
next election, a priest of the Lateran, Leo the Third, was preferred to
the nephew and the favorite of Adrian, whom he had promoted to the first
dignities of the church. Their acquiescence or repentance disguised,
above four years, the blackest intention of revenge, till the day of a
procession, when a furious band of conspirators dispersed the unarmed
multitude, and assaulted with blows and wounds the sacred person of
the pope. But their enterprise on his life or liberty was disappointed,
perhaps by their own confusion and remorse. Leo was left for dead on the
ground: on his revival from the swoon, the effect of his loss of blood,
he recovered his speech and sight; and this natural event was improved
to the miraculous restoration of his eyes and tongue, of which he had
been deprived, twice deprived, by the knife of the assassins. [91] From
his prison he escaped to the Vatican: the duke of Spoleto hastened to
his rescue, Charlemagne sympathized in his injury, and in his camp of
Paderborn in Westphalia accepted, or solicited, a visit from the Roman
pontiff. Leo repassed the Alps with a commission of counts and bishops,
the guards of his safety and the judges of his innocence; and it was not
without reluctance, that the conqueror of the Saxons delayed till the
ensuing year the personal discharge of this pious office. In his fourth
and last pilgrimage, he was received at Rome with the due honors of king
and patrician: Leo was permitted to purge himself by oath of the crimes
imputed to his charge: his enemies were silenced, and the sacrilegious
attempt against his life was punished by the mild and insufficient
penalty of exile. On the festival of Christmas, the last year of the
eighth century, Charlemagne appeared in the church of St. Peter; and,
to gratify the vanity of Rome, he had exchanged the simple dress of his
country for the habit of a patrician. [92] After the celebration of the
holy mysteries, Leo suddenly placed a precious crown on his head, [93]
and the dome resounded with the acclamations of the people, "Long life
and victory to Charles, the most pious Augustus, crowned by God
the great and pacific emperor of the Romans!" The head and body of
Charlemagne were consecrated by the royal unction: after the example
of the Caesars, he was saluted or adored by the pontiff: his coronation
oath represents a promise to maintain the faith and privileges of the
church; and the first-fruits were paid in his rich offerings to the
shrine of his apostle. In his familiar conversation, the emperor
protested the ignorance of the intentions of Leo, which he would have
disappointed by his absence on that memorable day. But the preparations
of the ceremony must have disclosed the secret; and the journey of
Charlemagne reveals his knowledge and expectation: he had acknowledged
that the Imperial title was the object of his ambition, and a Roman
synod had pronounced, that it was the only adequate reward of his merit
and services. [94]

[Footnote 89: His merits and hopes are summed up in an epitaph of
thirty-eight-verses, of which Charlemagne declares himself the author,
(Concil. tom. viii. p. 520.) Post patrem lacrymans Carolus haec carmina
scripsi. Tu mihi dulcis amor, te modo plango pater... Nomina jungo simul
titulis, clarissime, nostra Adrianus, Carolus, rex ego, tuque pater. The
poetry might be supplied by Alcuin; but the tears, the most glorious
tribute, can only belong to Charlemagne.]

[Footnote 90: Every new pope is admonished--"Sancte Pater, non videbis
annos Petri," twenty-five years. On the whole series the average is
about eight years--a short hope for an ambitious cardinal.]

[Footnote 91: The assurance of Anastasius (tom. iii. pars i. p. 197,
198) is supported by the credulity of some French annalists; but
Eginhard, and other writers of the same age, are more natural and
sincere. "Unus ei oculus paullulum est laesus," says John the deacon of
Naples, (Vit. Episcop. Napol. in Scriptores Muratori, tom. i. pars ii.
p. 312.) Theodolphus, a contemporary bishop of Orleans, observes with
prudence (l. iii. carm. 3.)

     Reddita sunt? mirum est: mirum est auferre nequtsse.
     Est tamen in dubio, hinc mirer an inde magis.]

[Footnote 92: Twice, at the request of Hadrian and Leo, he appeared at
Rome,--longa tunica et chlamyde amictus, et calceamentis quoque
Romano more formatis. Eginhard (c. xxiii. p. 109-113) describes, like
Suetonius the simplicity of his dress, so popular in the nation,
that when Charles the Bald returned to France in a foreign habit, the
patriotic dogs barked at the apostate, (Gaillard, Vie de Charlemagne,
tom. iv. p. 109.)]

[Footnote 93: See Anastasius (p. 199) and Eginhard, (c.xxviii. p.
124-128.) The unction is mentioned by Theophanes, (p. 399,) the oath
by Sigonius, (from the Ordo Romanus,) and the Pope's adoration more
antiquorum principum, by the Annales Bertiniani, (Script. Murator. tom.
ii. pars ii. p. 505.)]

[Footnote 94: This great event of the translation or restoration of
the empire is related and discussed by Natalis Alexander, (secul. ix.
dissert. i. p. 390-397,) Pagi, (tom. iii. p. 418,) Muratori, (Annali
d'Italia, tom. vi. p. 339-352,) Sigonius, (de Regno Italiae, l. iv.
Opp. tom. ii. p. 247-251,) Spanheim, (de ficta Translatione Imperii,)
Giannone, (tom. i. p. 395-405,) St. Marc, (Abrege Chronologique, tom.
i. p. 438-450,) Gaillard, (Hist. de Charlemagne, tom. ii. p. 386-446.)
Almost all these moderns have some religious or national bias.]

The appellation of great has been often bestowed, and sometimes
deserved; but Charlemagne is the only prince in whose favor the title
has been indissolubly blended with the name. That name, with the
addition of saint, is inserted in the Roman calendar; and the saint,
by a rare felicity, is crowned with the praises of the historians and
philosophers of an enlightened age. [95] His real merit is doubtless
enhanced by the barbarism of the nation and the times from which he
emerged: but the apparent magnitude of an object is likewise enlarged by
an unequal comparison; and the ruins of Palmyra derive a casual splendor
from the nakedness of the surrounding desert. Without injustice to his
fame, I may discern some blemishes in the sanctity and greatness of the
restorer of the Western empire. Of his moral virtues, chastity is
not the most conspicuous: [96] but the public happiness could not
be materially injured by his nine wives or concubines, the various
indulgence of meaner or more transient amours, the multitude of his
bastards whom he bestowed on the church, and the long celibacy and
licentious manners of his daughters, [97] whom the father was suspected
of loving with too fond a passion. [971] I shall be scarcely
permitted to accuse the ambition of a conqueror; but in a day of equal
retribution, the sons of his brother Carloman, the Merovingian princes
of Aquitain, and the four thousand five hundred Saxons who were beheaded
on the same spot, would have something to allege against the justice and
humanity of Charlemagne. His treatment of the vanquished Saxons [98]
was an abuse of the right of conquest; his laws were not less sanguinary
than his arms, and in the discussion of his motives, whatever is
subtracted from bigotry must be imputed to temper. The sedentary reader
is amazed by his incessant activity of mind and body; and his subjects
and enemies were not less astonished at his sudden presence, at the
moment when they believed him at the most distant extremity of the
empire; neither peace nor war, nor summer nor winter, were a season of
repose; and our fancy cannot easily reconcile the annals of his reign
with the geography of his expeditions. [981] But this activity was a
national, rather than a personal, virtue; the vagrant life of a Frank
was spent in the chase, in pilgrimage, in military adventures; and the
journeys of Charlemagne were distinguished only by a more numerous train
and a more important purpose. His military renown must be tried by
the scrutiny of his troops, his enemies, and his actions. Alexander
conquered with the arms of Philip, but the two heroes who preceded
Charlemagne bequeathed him their name, their examples, and the
companions of their victories. At the head of his veteran and superior
armies, he oppressed the savage or degenerate nations, who were
incapable of confederating for their common safety: nor did he ever
encounter an equal antagonist in numbers, in discipline, or in arms The
science of war has been lost and revived with the arts of peace; but
his campaigns are not illustrated by any siege or battle of singular
difficulty and success; and he might behold, with envy, the Saracen
trophies of his grandfather. After the Spanish expedition, his
rear-guard was defeated in the Pyrenaean mountains; and the soldiers,
whose situation was irretrievable, and whose valor was useless, might
accuse, with their last breath, the want of skill or caution of their
general. [99] I touch with reverence the laws of Charlemagne, so highly
applauded by a respectable judge. They compose not a system, but a
series, of occasional and minute edicts, for the correction of abuses,
the reformation of manners, the economy of his farms, the care of his
poultry, and even the sale of his eggs. He wished to improve the laws
and the character of the Franks; and his attempts, however feeble and
imperfect, are deserving of praise: the inveterate evils of the
times were suspended or mollified by his government; [100] but in his
institutions I can seldom discover the general views and the immortal
spirit of a legislator, who survives himself for the benefit of
posterity. The union and stability of his empire depended on the life
of a single man: he imitated the dangerous practice of dividing his
kingdoms among his sons; and after his numerous diets, the whole
constitution was left to fluctuate between the disorders of anarchy and
despotism. His esteem for the piety and knowledge of the clergy tempted
him to intrust that aspiring order with temporal dominion and civil
jurisdiction; and his son Lewis, when he was stripped and degraded
by the bishops, might accuse, in some measure, the imprudence of his
father. His laws enforced the imposition of tithes, because the daemons
had proclaimed in the air that the default of payment had been the
cause of the last scarcity. [101] The literary merits of Charlemagne
are attested by the foundation of schools, the introduction of arts, the
works which were published in his name, and his familiar connection with
the subjects and strangers whom he invited to his court to educate
both the prince and people. His own studies were tardy, laborious,
and imperfect; if he spoke Latin, and understood Greek, he derived the
rudiments of knowledge from conversation, rather than from books;
and, in his mature age, the emperor strove to acquire the practice
of writing, which every peasant now learns in his infancy. [102] The
grammar and logic, the music and astronomy, of the times, were only
cultivated as the handmaids of superstition; but the curiosity of
the human mind must ultimately tend to its improvement, and the
encouragement of learning reflects the purest and most pleasing lustre
on the character of Charlemagne. [103] The dignity of his person, [104]
the length of his reign, the prosperity of his arms, the vigor of his
government, and the reverence of distant nations, distinguish him from
the royal crowd; and Europe dates a new aera from his restoration of the
Western empire.

tom. ii. p. 317-360.)]

[Footnote 97: The marriage of Eginhard with Imma, daughter of
Charlemagne, is, in my opinion, sufficiently refuted by the probum and
suspicio that sullied these fair damsels, without excepting his own
wife, (c. xix. p. 98-100, cum Notis Schmincke.) The husband must have
been too strong for the historian.]

The murder of a priest or bishop. 5. Human sacrifices. 6. Eating meat
in Lent. But every crime might be expiated by baptism or penance,
(Gaillard, tom. ii. p. 241-247;) and the Christian Saxons became the
friends and equals of the Franks, (Struv. Corpus Hist. Germanicae,
p.133.)]

was slain--cum compluribus aliis. See the truth in Eginhard, (c. 9, p.
51-56,) and the fable in an ingenious Supplement of M. Gaillard, (tom.
iii. p. 474.) The Spaniards are too proud of a victory, which history
ascribes to the Gascons, and romance to the Saracens. * Note: In
fact, it was a sudden onset of the Gascons, assisted by the Beaure
mountaineers, and possibly a few Navarrese.--M.]

interior disorders and oppression of his reign, (Hist. des Allemands,

[Footnote 101: Omnis homo ex sua proprietate legitimam decimam ad
ecclesiam conferat. Experimento enim didicimus, in anno, quo illa valida
fames irrepsit, ebullire vacuas annonas a daemonibus devoratas, et voces
exprobationis auditas. Such is the decree and assertion of the great
Council of Frankfort, (canon xxv. tom. ix. p. 105.) Both Selden (Hist.
of Tithes; Works, vol. iii. part ii. p. 1146) and Montesquieu (Esprit
des Loix, l. xxxi. c. 12) represent Charlemagne as the first legal
author of tithes. Such obligations have country gentlemen to his
memory!]

[Footnote 102: Eginhard (c. 25, p. 119) clearly affirms, tentabat et
scribere... sed parum prospere successit labor praeposterus et sero
inchoatus. The moderns have perverted and corrected this obvious
meaning, and the title of M. Gaillard's dissertation (tom. iii. p.
247-260) betrays his partiality. * Note: This point has been contested;
but Mr. Hallam and Monsieur Sismondl concur with Gibbon. See Middle
Ages, iii. 330, Histoire de Francais, tom. ii. p. 318. The sensible
observations of the latter are quoted in the Quarterly Review, vol.
xlviii. p. 451. Fleury, I may add, quotes from Mabillon a remarkable
evidence that Charlemagne "had a mark to himself like an honest,
plain-dealing man." Ibid.--M.]

ii. p. 121-129.]

[Footnote 104: M. Gaillard (tom. iii. p. 372) fixes the true stature of
Charlemagne (see a Dissertation of Marquard Freher ad calcem Eginhart,
p. 220, &c.) at five feet nine inches of French, about six feet one inch
and a fourth English, measure. The romance writers have increased it
to eight feet, and the giant was endowed with matchless strength and
appetite: at a single stroke of his good sword Joyeuse, he cut asunder
a horseman and his horse; at a single repast, he devoured a goose, two
fowls, a quarter of mutton, &c.]

That empire was not unworthy of its title; [105] and some of the fairest
kingdoms of Europe were the patrimony or conquest of a prince, who
reigned at the same time in France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Hungary.
[106] I. The Roman province of Gaul had been transformed into the name
and monarchy of France; but, in the decay of the Merovingian line, its
limits were contracted by the independence of the Britons and the revolt
of Aquitain. Charlemagne pursued, and confined, the Britons on the
shores of the ocean; and that ferocious tribe, whose origin and language
are so different from the French, was chastised by the imposition of
tribute, hostages, and peace. After a long and evasive contest, the
rebellion of the dukes of Aquitain was punished by the forfeiture of
their province, their liberty, and their lives.

Harsh and rigorous would have been such treatment of ambitious
governors, who had too faithfully copied the mayors of the palace. But
a recent discovery [107] has proved that these unhappy princes were the
last and lawful heirs of the blood and sceptre of Clovis, and younger
branch, from the brother of Dagobert, of the Merovingian house. Their
ancient kingdom was reduced to the duchy of Gascogne, to the counties
of Fesenzac and Armagnac, at the foot of the Pyrenees: their race
was propagated till the beginning of the sixteenth century; and after
surviving their Carlovingian tyrants, they were reserved to feel
the injustice, or the favors, of a third dynasty. By the reunion of
Aquitain, France was enlarged to its present boundaries, with the
additions of the Netherlands and Spain, as far as the Rhine. II.

The Saracens had been expelled from France by the grandfather and father
of Charlemagne; but they still possessed the greatest part of Spain,
from the rock of Gibraltar to the Pyrenees. Amidst their civil
divisions, an Arabian emir of Saragossa implored his protection in the
diet of Paderborn. Charlemagne undertook the expedition, restored
the emir, and, without distinction of faith, impartially crushed the
resistance of the Christians, and rewarded the obedience and services
of the Mahometans. In his absence he instituted the Spanish march, [108]
which extended from the Pyrenees to the River Ebro: Barcelona was the
residence of the French governor: he possessed the counties of Rousillon
and Catalonia; and the infant kingdoms of Navarre and Arragon were
subject to his jurisdiction. III. As king of the Lombards, and patrician
of Rome, he reigned over the greatest part of Italy, [109] a tract of
a thousand miles from the Alps to the borders of Calabria. The duchy of
Beneventum, a Lombard fief, had spread, at the expense of the Greeks,
over the modern kingdom of Naples. But Arrechis, the reigning duke,
refused to be included in the slavery of his country; assumed the
independent title of prince; and opposed his sword to the Carlovingian
monarchy. His defence was firm, his submission was not inglorious, and
the emperor was content with an easy tribute, the demolition of his
fortresses, and the acknowledgement, on his coins, of a supreme lord.
The artful flattery of his son Grimoald added the appellation of father,
but he asserted his dignity with prudence, and Benventum insensibly
escaped from the French yoke. [110] IV. Charlemagne was the first who
united Germany under the same sceptre. The name of Oriental France
is preserved in the circle of Franconia; and the people of Hesse and
Thuringia were recently incorporated with the victors, by the conformity
of religion and government. The Alemanni, so formidable to the Romans,
were the faithful vassals and confederates of the Franks; and their
country was inscribed within the modern limits of Alsace, Swabia, and
Switzerland. The Bavarians, with a similar indulgence of their laws and
manners, were less patient of a master: the repeated treasons of Tasillo
justified the abolition of their hereditary dukes; and their power was
shared among the counts, who judged and guarded that important frontier.
But the north of Germany, from the Rhine and beyond the Elbe, was still
hostile and Pagan; nor was it till after a war of thirty-three years
that the Saxons bowed under the yoke of Christ and of Charlemagne.
The idols and their votaries were extirpated: the foundation of eight
bishoprics, of Munster, Osnaburgh, Paderborn, and Minden, of Bremen,
Verden, Hildesheim, and Halberstadt, define, on either side of the
Weser, the bounds of ancient Saxony these episcopal seats were the first
schools and cities of that savage land; and the religion and humanity
of the children atoned, in some degree, for the massacre of the parents.
Beyond the Elbe, the Slavi, or Sclavonians, of similar manners and
various denominations, overspread the modern dominions of Prussia,
Poland, and Bohemia, and some transient marks of obedience have tempted
the French historian to extend the empire to the Baltic and the Vistula.
The conquest or conversion of those countries is of a more recent age;
but the first union of Bohemia with the Germanic body may be justly
ascribed to the arms of Charlemagne. V. He retaliated on the Avars, or
Huns of Pannonia, the same calamities which they had inflicted on the
nations. Their rings, the wooden fortifications which encircled their
districts and villages, were broken down by the triple effort of a
French army, that was poured into their country by land and water,
through the Carpathian mountains and along the plain of the Danube.
After a bloody conflict of eight years, the loss of some French generals
was avenged by the slaughter of the most noble Huns: the relics of the
nation submitted the royal residence of the chagan was left desolate and
unknown; and the treasures, the rapine of two hundred and fifty years,
enriched the victorious troops, or decorated the churches of Italy and
Gaul. [111] After the reduction of Pannonia, the empire of Charlemagne
was bounded only by the conflux of the Danube with the Teyss and the
Save: the provinces of Istria, Liburnia, and Dalmatia, were an easy,
though unprofitable, accession; and it was an effect of his moderation,
that he left the maritime cities under the real or nominal sovereignty
of the Greeks. But these distant possessions added more to the
reputation than to the power of the Latin emperor; nor did he risk any
ecclesiastical foundations to reclaim the Barbarians from their vagrant
life and idolatrous worship. Some canals of communication between the
rivers, the Saone and the Meuse, the Rhine and the Danube, were faintly
attempted. [112] Their execution would have vivified the empire; and
more cost and labor were often wasted in the structure of a cathedral.

Rousillon contains 188,900 subjects, and annually pays 2,600,000 livres,
(Necker, Administration des Finances, tom. i. p. 278, 279;) more people,
perhaps, and doubtless more money than the march of Charlemagne.]

Muratori.]

[Footnote 111: Quot praelia in eo gesta! quantum sanguinis effusum sit!
Testatur vacua omni habitatione Pannonia, et locus in quo regia Cagani
fuit ita desertus, ut ne vestigium quidem humanae habitationis appareat.
Tota in hoc bello Hunnorum nobilitas periit, tota gloria decidit, omnis
pecunia et congesti ex longo tempore thesauri direpti sunt. Eginhard,
cxiii.]

[Footnote 112: The junction of the Rhine and Danube was undertaken only
for the service of the Pannonian war, (Gaillard, Vie de Charlemagne,
tom. ii. p. 312-315.) The canal, which would have been only two leagues
in length, and of which some traces are still extant in Swabia, was
interrupted by excessive rains, military avocations, and superstitious
fears, (Schaepflin, Hist. de l'Academie des Inscriptions, tom. xviii. p.
256. Molimina fluviorum, &c., jungendorum, p. 59-62.)]

[Footnote 1121: I should doubt this in the time of Charlemagne, even if
the term "expended" were substituted for "wasted."--M.]
