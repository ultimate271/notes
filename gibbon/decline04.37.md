After the extinction of paganism, the Christians in peace and piety
might have enjoyed their solitary triumph. But the principle of discord
was alive in their bosom, and they were more solicitous to explore the
nature, than to practice the laws, of their founder. I have already
observed, that the disputes of the Trinity were succeeded by those of
the Incarnation; alike scandalous to the church, alike pernicious to the
state, still more minute in their origin, still more durable in their
effects.

It is my design to comprise in the present chapter a religious war
of two hundred and fifty years, to represent the ecclesiastical and
political schism of the Oriental sects, and to introduce their clamorous
or sanguinary contests, by a modest inquiry into the doctrines of the
primitive church. [1]

[Footnote 1: By what means shall I authenticate this previous inquiry,
which I have studied to circumscribe and compress?--If I persist in
supporting each fact or reflection by its proper and special evidence,
every line would demand a string of testimonies, and every note would
swell to a critical dissertation. But the numberless passages of
antiquity which I have seen with my own eyes, are compiled, digested and
illustrated by Petavius and Le Clerc, by Beausobre and Mosheim. I shall
be content to fortify my narrative by the names and characters of these
respectable guides; and in the contemplation of a minute or remote
object, I am not ashamed to borrow the aid of the strongest glasses: 1.
The Dogmata Theologica of Petavius are a work of incredible labor and
compass; the volumes which relate solely to the Incarnation (two folios,
vth and vith, of 837 pages) are divided into xvi. books--the first
of history, the remainder of controversy and doctrine. The Jesuit's
learning is copious and correct; his Latinity is pure, his method clear,
his argument profound and well connected; but he is the slave of the
fathers, the scourge of heretics, and the enemy of truth and candor,
as often as they are inimical to the Catholic cause. 2. The Arminian
Le Clerc, who has composed in a quarto volume (Amsterdam, 1716) the
ecclesiastical history of the two first centuries, was free both in his
temper and situation; his sense is clear, but his thoughts are narrow;
he reduces the reason or folly of ages to the standard of his private
judgment, and his impartiality is sometimes quickened, and sometimes
tainted by his opposition to the fathers. See the heretics (Cerinthians,
lxxx. Ebionites, ciii. Carpocratians, cxx. Valentiniins, cxxi.
Basilidians, cxxiii. Marcionites, cxli., &c.) under their proper dates.
3. The Histoire Critique du Manicheisme (Amsterdam, 1734, 1739, in
two vols. in 4to., with a posthumous dissertation sur les Nazarenes,
Lausanne, 1745) of M. de Beausobre is a treasure of ancient philosophy
and theology. The learned historian spins with incomparable art the
systematic thread of opinion, and transforms himself by turns into the
person of a saint, a sage, or a heretic. Yet his refinement is sometimes
excessive; he betrays an amiable partiality in favor of the weaker side,
and, while he guards against calumny, he does not allow sufficient scope
for superstition and fanaticism. A copious table of contents will direct
the reader to any point that he wishes to examine. 4. Less profound than
Petavius, less independent than Le Clerc, less ingenious than Beausobre,
the historian Mosheim is full, rational, correct, and moderate. In his
learned work, De Rebus Christianis ante Constantinum (Helmstadt 1753,
in 4to.,) see the Nazarenes and Ebionites, p. 172--179, 328--332. The
Gnostics in general, p. 179, &c. Cerinthus, p. 196--202. Basilides, p.
352--361. Carpocrates, p. 363--367. Valentinus, p. 371--389 Marcion, p.
404--410. The Manichaeans, p. 829-837, &c.]

I. A laudable regard for the honor of the first proselyte has
countenanced the belief, the hope, the wish, that the Ebionites, or
at least the Nazarenes, were distinguished only by their obstinate
perseverance in the practice of the Mosaic rites.

Their churches have disappeared, their books are obliterated: their
obscure freedom might allow a latitude of faith, and the softness of
their infant creed would be variously moulded by the zeal or prudence of
three hundred years. Yet the most charitable criticism must refuse
these sectaries any knowledge of the pure and proper divinity of Christ.
Educated in the school of Jewish prophecy and prejudice, they had never
been taught to elevate their hopes above a human and temporal Messiah.
[2] If they had courage to hail their king when he appeared in a
plebeian garb, their grosser apprehensions were incapable of discerning
their God, who had studiously disguised his celestial character under
the name and person of a mortal. [3] The familiar companions of Jesus
of Nazareth conversed with their friend and countryman, who, in all the
actions of rational and animal life, appeared of the same species with
themselves. His progress from infancy to youth and manhood was marked by
a regular increase in stature and wisdom; and after a painful agony
of mind and body, he expired on the cross. He lived and died for the
service of mankind: but the life and death of Socrates had likewise been
devoted to the cause of religion and justice; and although the stoic
or the hero may disdain the humble virtues of Jesus, the tears which he
shed over his friend and country may be esteemed the purest evidence of
his humanity. The miracles of the gospel could not astonish a people who
held with intrepid faith the more splendid prodigies of the Mosaic
law. The prophets of ancient days had cured diseases, raised the dead,
divided the sea, stopped the sun, and ascended to heaven in a fiery
chariot. And the metaphorical style of the Hebrews might ascribe to a
saint and martyr the adoptive title of Son of God.

[Footnote 2: Jew Tryphon, (Justin. Dialog. p. 207) in the name of his
countrymen, and the modern Jews, the few who divert their thoughts from
money to religion, still hold the same language, and allege the literal
sense of the prophets. * Note: See on this passage Bp. Kaye, Justin
Martyr, p. 25.--M. Note: Most of the modern writers, who have closely
examined this subject, and who will not be suspected of any theological
bias, Rosenmuller on Isaiah ix. 5, and on Psalm xlv. 7, and Bertholdt,
Christologia Judaeorum, c. xx., rightly ascribe much higher notions
of the Messiah to the Jews. In fact, the dispute seems to rest on the
notion that there was a definite and authorized notion of the Messiah,
among the Jews, whereas it was probably so vague, as to admit every
shade of difference, from the vulgar expectation of a mere temporal
king, to the philosophic notion of an emanation from the Deity.--M.]

[Footnote 3: Chrysostom (Basnage, Hist. des Juifs, tom. v. c. 9, p. 183)
and Athanasius (Petav. Dogmat. Theolog. tom. v. l. i. c. 2, p. 3) are
obliged to confess that the Divinity of Christ is rarely mentioned by
himself or his apostles.]

Yet in the insufficient creed of the Nazarenes and the Ebionites, a
distinction is faintly noticed between the heretics, who confounded the
generation of Christ in the common order of nature, and the less guilty
schismatics, who revered the virginity of his mother, and excluded the
aid of an earthly father. The incredulity of the former was countenanced
by the visible circumstances of his birth, the legal marriage of the
reputed parents, Joseph and Mary, and his lineal claim to the kingdom of
David and the inheritance of Judah. But the secret and authentic history
has been recorded in several copies of the Gospel according to St.
Matthew, [4] which these sectaries long preserved in the original
Hebrew, [5] as the sole evidence of their faith. The natural suspicions
of the husband, conscious of his own chastity, were dispelled by the
assurance (in a dream) that his wife was pregnant of the Holy Ghost: and
as this distant and domestic prodigy could not fall under the personal
observation of the historian, he must have listened to the same voice
which dictated to Isaiah the future conception of a virgin. The son of
a virgin, generated by the ineffable operation of the Holy Spirit, was a
creature without example or resemblance, superior in every attribute
of mind and body to the children of Adam. Since the introduction of the
Greek or Chaldean philosophy, [6] the Jews [7] were persuaded of the
preexistence, transmigration, and immortality of souls; and providence
was justified by a supposition, that they were confined in their earthly
prisons to expiate the stains which they had contracted in a former
state. [8] But the degrees of purity and corruption are almost
immeasurable. It might be fairly presumed, that the most sublime and
virtuous of human spirits was infused into the offspring of Mary and
the Holy Ghost; [9] that his abasement was the result of his voluntary
choice; and that the object of his mission was, to purify, not his
own, but the sins of the world. On his return to his native skies, he
received the immense reward of his obedience; the everlasting kingdom of
the Messiah, which had been darkly foretold by the prophets, under the
carnal images of peace, of conquest, and of dominion. Omnipotence could
enlarge the human faculties of Christ to the extend of is celestial
office. In the language of antiquity, the title of God has not been
severely confined to the first parent, and his incomparable minister,
his only-begotten son, might claim, without presumption, the religious,
though secondary, worship of a subject of a subject world.

[Footnote 4: The two first chapters of St. Matthew did not exist in
the Ebionite copies, (Epiphan. Haeres. xxx. 13;) and the miraculous
conception is one of the last articles which Dr. Priestley has curtailed
from his scanty creed. * Note: The distinct allusion to the facts
related in the two first chapters of the Gospel, in a work evidently
written about the end of the reign of Nero, the Ascensio Isaiae, edited
by Archbishop Lawrence, seems convincing evidence that they are integral
parts of the authentic Christian history.--M.]

[Footnote 5: It is probable enough that the first of the Gospels for the
use of the Jewish converts was composed in the Hebrew or Syriac idiom:
the fact is attested by a chain of fathers--Papias, Irenaeus, Origen,
Jerom, &c. It is devoutly believed by the Catholics, and admitted by
Casaubon, Grotius, and Isaac Vossius, among the Protestant critics. But
this Hebrew Gospel of St. Matthew is most unaccountably lost; and we
may accuse the diligence or fidelity of the primitive churches, who have
preferred the unauthorized version of some nameless Greek. Erasmus
and his followers, who respect our Greek text as the original Gospel,
deprive themselves of the evidence which declares it to be the work
of an apostle. See Simon, Hist. Critique, &c., tom. iii. c. 5--9, p.
47--101, and the Prolegomena of Mill and Wetstein to the New Testament.
* Note: Surely the extinction of the Judaeo-Christian community related
from Mosheim by Gibbon himself (c. xv.) accounts both simply and
naturally for the loss of a composition, which had become of no
use--nor does it follow that the Greek Gospel of St. Matthew is
unauthorized.--M.]

[Footnote 6: The metaphysics of the soul are disengaged by Cicero
(Tusculan. l. i.) and Maximus of Tyre (Dissertat. xvi.) from the
intricacies of dialogue, which sometimes amuse, and often perplex, the
readers of the Phoedrus, the Phoedon, and the Laws of Plato.]

[Footnote 7: The disciples of Jesus were persuaded that a man might have
sinned before he was born, (John, ix. 2,) and the Pharisees held the
transmigration of virtuous souls, (Joseph. de Bell. Judaico, l. ii. c.
7;) and a modern Rabbi is modestly assured, that Hermes, Pythagoras,
Plato, &c., derived their metaphysics from his illustrious countrymen.]

[Footnote 8: Four different opinions have been entertained concerning
the origin of human souls: 1. That they are eternal and divine. 2. That
they were created in a separate state of existence, before their union
with the body. 3. That they have been propagated from the original stock
of Adam, who contained in himself the mental as well as the corporeal
seed of his posterity. 4. That each soul is occasionally created and
embodied in the moment of conception.--The last of these sentiments
appears to have prevailed among the moderns; and our spiritual history
is grown less sublime, without becoming more intelligible.]

[Footnote 9: It was one of the fifteen heresies imputed to Origen, and
denied by his apologist, (Photius, Bibliothec. cod. cxvii. p. 296.) Some
of the Rabbis attribute one and the same soul to the persons of Adam,
David, and the Messiah.]

II. The seeds of the faith, which had slowly arisen in the rocky and
ungrateful soil of Judea, were transplanted, in full maturity, to the
happier climes of the Gentiles; and the strangers of Rome or Asia, who
never beheld the manhood, were the more readily disposed to embrace the
divinity, of Christ. The polytheist and the philosopher, the Greek and
the Barbarian, were alike accustomed to conceive a long succession,
an infinite chain of angels or daemons, or deities, or aeons, or
emanations, issuing from the throne of light. Nor could it seem strange
or incredible, that the first of these aeons, the Logos, or Word of God,
of the same substance with the Father, should descend upon earth, to
deliver the human race from vice and error, and to conduct them in
the paths of life and immortality. But the prevailing doctrine of the
eternity and inherent pravity of matter infected the primitive churches
of the East. Many among the Gentile proselytes refused to believe that
a celestial spirit, an undivided portion of the first essence, had been
personally united with a mass of impure and contaminated flesh; and,
in their zeal for the divinity, they piously abjured the humanity, of
Christ. While his blood was still recent on Mount Calvary, [10]
the Docetes, a numerous and learned sect of Asiatics, invented the
phantastic system, which was afterwards propagated by the Marcionites,
the Manichaeans, and the various names of the Gnostic heresy. [11] They
denied the truth and authenticity of the Gospels, as far as they relate
the conception of Mary, the birth of Christ, and the thirty years that
preceded the exercise of his ministry. He first appeared on the banks of
the Jordan in the form of perfect manhood; but it was a form only, and
not a substance; a human figure created by the hand of Omnipotence to
imitate the faculties and actions of a man, and to impose a perpetual
illusion on the senses of his friends and enemies. Articulate sounds
vibrated on the ears of the disciples; but the image which was impressed
on their optic nerve eluded the more stubborn evidence of the touch; and
they enjoyed the spiritual, not the corporeal, presence of the Son of
God. The rage of the Jews was idly wasted against an impassive phantom;
and the mystic scenes of the passion and death, the resurrection and
ascension, of Christ were represented on the theatre of Jerusalem for
the benefit of mankind. If it were urged, that such ideal mimicry,
such incessant deception, was unworthy of the God of truth, the Docetes
agreed with too many of their orthodox brethren in the justification of
pious falsehood. In the system of the Gnostics, the Jehovah of Israel,
the Creator of this lower world, was a rebellious, or at least an
ignorant, spirit. The Son of God descended upon earth to abolish his
temple and his law; and, for the accomplishment of this salutary end, he
dexterously transferred to his own person the hope and prediction of a
temporal Messiah.

[Footnote 10: Apostolis adhuc in seculo superstitibus, apud Judaeam
Christi sanguine recente, Phantasma domini corpus asserebatur. Hieronym,
advers. Lucifer. c. 8. The epistle of Ignatius to the Smyrnaeans, and
even the Gospel according to St. John, are levelled against the growing
error of the Docetes, who had obtained too much credit in the world,
(1 John, iv. 1--5.)]

[Footnote 11: About the year 200 of the Christian aera, Irenaeus
and Hippolytus efuted the thirty-two sects, which had multiplied to
fourscore in the time of Epiphanius, (Phot. Biblioth. cod. cxx. cxxi.
cxxii.) The five books of Irenaeus exist only in barbarous Latin; but
the original might perhaps be found in some monastery of Greece.]

One of the most subtile disputants of the Manichaean school has pressed
the danger and indecency of supposing, that the God of the Christians,
in the state of a human foetus, emerged at the end of nine months from
a female womb. The pious horror of his antagonists provoked them to
disclaim all sensual circumstances of conception and delivery; to
maintain that the divinity passed through Mary like a sunbeam through a
plate of glass; and to assert, that the seal of her virginity remained
unbroken even at the moment when she became the mother of Christ. But
the rashness of these concessions has encouraged a milder sentiment of
those of the Docetes, who taught, not that Christ was a phantom, but
that he was clothed with an impassible and incorruptible body.
Such, indeed, in the more orthodox system, he has acquired since his
resurrection, and such he must have always possessed, if it were capable
of pervading, without resistance or injury, the density of intermediate
matter. Devoid of its most essential properties, it might be exempt
from the attributes and infirmities of the flesh. A foetus that could
increase from an invisible point to its full maturity; a child that
could attain the stature of perfect manhood without deriving any
nourishment from the ordinary sources, might continue to exist without
repairing a daily waste by a daily supply of external matter. Jesus
might share the repasts of his disciples without being subject to the
calls of thirst or hunger; and his virgin purity was never sullied
by the involuntary stains of sensual concupiscence. Of a body thus
singularly constituted, a question would arise, by what means, and of
what materials, it was originally framed; and our sounder theology is
startled by an answer which was not peculiar to the Gnostics, that both
the form and the substance proceeded from the divine essence. The idea
of pure and absolute spirit is a refinement of modern philosophy: the
incorporeal essence, ascribed by the ancients to human souls, celestial
beings, and even the Deity himself, does not exclude the notion of
extended space; and their imagination was satisfied with a subtile
nature of air, or fire, or aether, incomparably more perfect than
the grossness of the material world. If we define the place, we must
describe the figure, of the Deity. Our experience, perhaps our vanity,
represents the powers of reason and virtue under a human form. The
Anthropomorphites, who swarmed among the monks of Egypt and the
Catholics of Africa, could produce the express declaration of Scripture,
that man was made after the image of his Creator. [12] The venerable
Serapion, one of the saints of the Nitrian deserts, relinquished, with
many a tear, his darling prejudice; and bewailed, like an infant, his
unlucky conversion, which had stolen away his God, and left his mind
without any visible object of faith or devotion. [13]

[Footnote 12: The pilgrim Cassian, who visited Egypt in the beginning
of the vth century, observes and laments the reign of anthropomorphism
among the monks, who were not conscious that they embraced the system
of Epicurus, (Cicero, de Nat. Deorum, i. 18, 34.) Ab universo propemodum
genere monachorum, qui per totam provinciam Egyptum morabantur, pro
simplicitatis errore susceptum est, ut e contraric memoratum pontificem
(Theophilus) velut haeresi gravissima depravatum, pars maxima seniorum
ab universo fraternitatis corpore decerneret detestandum, (Cassian,
Collation. x. 2.) As long as St. Augustin remained a Manichaean, he was
scandalized by the anthropomorphism of the vulgar Catholics.]

[Footnote 13: Ita est in oratione senex mente confusus, eo quod illam
imaginem Deitatis, quam proponere sibi in oratione consueverat, aboleri
de suo corde sentiret, ut in amarissimos fletus, crebrosque singultus
repente prorumpens, in terram prostratus, cum ejulatu validissimo
proclamaret; "Heu me miserum! tulerunt a me Deum meum, et quem nunc
teneam non habeo, vel quem adorem, aut interpallam am nescio." Cassian,
Collat. x. 2.]

III. Such were the fleeting shadows of the Docetes. A more substantial,
though less simple, hypothesis, was contrived by Cerinthus of Asia, [14]
who dared to oppose the last of the apostles. Placed on the confines of
the Jewish and Gentile world, he labored to reconcile the Gnostic with
the Ebionite, by confessing in the same Messiah the supernatural union
of a man and a God; and this mystic doctrine was adopted with many
fanciful improvements by Carpocrates, Basilides, and Valentine, [15] the
heretics of the Egyptian school. In their eyes, Jesus of Nazareth was a
mere mortal, the legitimate son of Joseph and Mary: but he was the
best and wisest of the human race, selected as the worthy instrument to
restore upon earth the worship of the true and supreme Deity. When he
was baptized in the Jordan, the Christ, the first of the aeons, the Son
of God himself, descended on Jesus in the form of a dove, to inhabit his
mind, and direct his actions during the allotted period of his ministry.
When the Messiah was delivered into the hands of the Jews, the Christ,
an immortal and impassible being, forsook his earthly tabernacle, flew
back to the pleroma or world of spirits, and left the solitary Jesus to
suffer, to complain, and to expire. But the justice and generosity of
such a desertion are strongly questionable; and the fate of an innocent
martyr, at first impelled, and at length abandoned, by his divine
companion, might provoke the pity and indignation of the profane.
Their murmurs were variously silenced by the sectaries who espoused and
modified the double system of Cerinthus. It was alleged, that when Jesus
was nailed to the cross, he was endowed with a miraculous apathy of mind
and body, which rendered him insensible of his apparent sufferings.
It was affirmed, that these momentary, though real, pangs would be
abundantly repaid by the temporal reign of a thousand years reserved for
the Messiah in his kingdom of the new Jerusalem. It was insinuated,
that if he suffered, he deserved to suffer; that human nature is never
absolutely perfect; and that the cross and passion might serve to
expiate the venial transgressions of the son of Joseph, before his
mysterious union with the Son of God. [16]

[Footnote 14: St. John and Cerinthus (A.D. 80. Cleric. Hist. Eccles.
p. 493) accidentally met in the public bath of Ephesus; but the apostle
fled from the heretic, lest the building should tumble on their heads.
This foolish story, reprobated by Dr. Middleton, (Miscellaneous Works,
vol. ii.,) is related, however, by Irenaeus, (iii. 3,) on the evidence
of Polycarp, and was probably suited to the time and residence of
Cerinthus. The obsolete, yet probably the true, reading of 1 John, iv.
3 alludes to the double nature of that primitive heretic. * Note:
Griesbach asserts that all the Greek Mss., all the translators, and all
the Greek fathers, support the common reading.--Nov. Test. in loc.--M]

[Footnote 15: The Valentinians embraced a complex, and almost
incoherent, system. 1. Both Christ and Jesus were aeons, though of
different degrees; the one acting as the rational soul, the other as the
divine spirit of the Savior. 2. At the time of the passion, they both
retired, and left only a sensitive soul and a human body. 3. Even
that body was aethereal, and perhaps apparent.--Such are the laborious
conclusions of Mosheim. But I much doubt whether the Latin translator
understood Irenaeus, and whether Irenaeus and the Valetinians understood
themselves.]

[Footnote 16: The heretics abused the passionate exclamation of "My God,
my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" Rousseau, who has drawn an eloquent,
but indecent, parallel between Christ and Socrates, forgets that not
a word of impatience or despair escaped from the mouth of the dying
philosopher. In the Messiah, such sentiments could be only apparent; and
such ill-sounding words were properly explained as the application of a
psalm and prophecy.]

IV. All those who believe the immateriality of the soul, a specious
and noble tenet, must confess, from their present experience, the
incomprehensible union of mind and matter. A similar union is not
inconsistent with a much higher, or even with the highest, degree of
mental faculties; and the incarnation of an aeon or archangel, the most
perfect of created spirits, does not involve any positive contradiction
or absurdity. In the age of religious freedom, which was determined
by the council of Nice, the dignity of Christ was measured by private
judgment according to the indefinite rule of Scripture, or reason, or
tradition. But when his pure and proper divinity had been established on
the ruins of Arianism, the faith of the Catholics trembled on the edge
of a precipice where it was impossible to recede, dangerous to stand,
dreadful to fall and the manifold inconveniences of their creed were
aggravated by the sublime character of their theology. They hesitated
to pronounce; that God himself, the second person of an equal and
consubstantial trinity, was manifested in the flesh; [17] that a being
who pervades the universe, had been confined in the womb of Mary; that
his eternal duration had been marked by the days, and months, and years
of human existence; that the Almighty had been scourged and crucified;
that his impassible essence had felt pain and anguish; that his
omniscience was not exempt from ignorance; and that the source of life
and immortality expired on Mount Calvary. These alarming consequences
were affirmed with unblushing simplicity by Apollinaris, [18] bishop of
Laodicea, and one of the luminaries of the church. The son of a learned
grammarian, he was skilled in all the sciences of Greece; eloquence,
erudition, and philosophy, conspicuous in the volumes of Apollinaris,
were humbly devoted to the service of religion. The worthy friend of
Athanasius, the worthy antagonist of Julian, he bravely wrestled
with the Arians and Polytheists, and though he affected the rigor of
geometrical demonstration, his commentaries revealed the literal and
allegorical sense of the Scriptures. A mystery, which had long floated
in the looseness of popular belief, was defined by his perverse
diligence in a technical form; and he first proclaimed the memorable
words, "One incarnate nature of Christ," which are still reechoed with
hostile clamors in the churches of Asia, Egypt, and Aethiopia. He taught
that the Godhead was united or mingled with the body of a man; and
that the Logos, the eternal wisdom, supplied in the flesh the place and
office of a human soul. Yet as the profound doctor had been terrified at
his own rashness, Apollinaris was heard to mutter some faint accents
of excuse and explanation. He acquiesced in the old distinction of the
Greek philosophers between the rational and sensitive soul of man; that
he might reserve the Logos for intellectual functions, and employ the
subordinate human principle in the meaner actions of animal life.

With the moderate Docetes, he revered Mary as the spiritual, rather than
as the carnal, mother of Christ, whose body either came from heaven,
impassible and incorruptible, or was absorbed, and as it were
transformed, into the essence of the Deity. The system of Apollinaris
was strenuously encountered by the Asiatic and Syrian divines whose
schools are honored by the names of Basil, Gregory and Chrysostom, and
tainted by those of Diodorus, Theodore, and Nestorius. But the person
of the aged bishop of Laedicea, his character and dignity, remained
inviolate; and his rivals, since we may not suspect them of the weakness
of toleration, were astonished, perhaps, by the novelty of the argument,
and diffident of the final sentence of the Catholic church. Her judgment
at length inclined in their favor; the heresy of Apollinaris was
condemned, and the separate congregations of his disciples were
proscribed by the Imperial laws. But his principles were secretly
entertained in the monasteries of Egypt, and his enemies felt the
hatred of Theophilus and Cyril, the successive patriarchs of Alexandria.
[Footnote 17: This strong expression might be justified by the language
of St. Paul, (1 Tim. iii. 16;) but we are deceived by our modern Bibles.
The word which was altered to God at Constantinople in the beginning of
the vith century: the true reading, which is visible in the Latin and
Syriac versions, still exists in the reasoning of the Greek, as well as
of the Latin fathers; and this fraud, with that of the three witnesses
of St. John, is admirably detected by Sir Isaac Newton. (See his two
letters translated by M. de Missy, in the Journal Britannique, tom. xv.
p. 148--190, 351--390.) I have weighed the arguments, and may yield to
the authority of the first of philosophers, who was deeply skilled in
critical and theological studies. Note: It should be Griesbach in loc.
The weight of authority is so much against the common reading in
both these points, that they are no longer urged by prudent
controversialists. Would Gibbon's deference for the first of
philosophers have extended to all his theological conclusions?--M.]

[Footnote 18: For Apollinaris and his sect, see Socrates, l. ii. c. 46,
l. iii. c. 16 Sazomen, l. v. c. 18, 1. vi. c. 25, 27. Theodoret, l. v.

mentions the bishop of Laodicea as a friend and brother. The style
of the more recent historians is harsh and hostile: yet Philostorgius
compares him (l. viii. c. 11-15) to Basil and Gregory.]

V. The grovelling Ebionite, and the fantastic Docetes, were rejected and
forgotten: the recent zeal against the errors of Apollinaris reduced the
Catholics to a seeming agreement with the double nature of Cerinthus.
But instead of a temporary and occasional alliance, they established,
and we still embrace, the substantial, indissoluble, and everlasting
union of a perfect God with a perfect man, of the second person of the
trinity with a reasonable soul and human flesh. In the beginning of the
fifth century, the unity of the two natures was the prevailing doctrine
of the church. On all sides, it was confessed, that the mode of their
coexistence could neither be represented by our ideas, nor expressed by
our language. Yet a secret and incurable discord was cherished, between
those who were most apprehensive of confounding, and those who were
most fearful of separating, the divinity, and the humanity, of Christ.
Impelled by religious frenzy, they fled with adverse haste from
the error which they mutually deemed most destructive of truth and
salvation. On either hand they were anxious to guard, they were jealous
to defend, the union and the distinction of the two natures, and to
invent such forms of speech, such symbols of doctrine, as were least
susceptible of doubt or ambiguity. The poverty of ideas and language
tempted them to ransack art and nature for every possible comparison,
and each comparison mislead their fancy in the explanation of an
incomparable mystery. In the polemic microscope, an atom is enlarged
to a monster, and each party was skilful to exaggerate the absurd or
impious conclusions that might be extorted from the principles of their
adversaries. To escape from each other, they wandered through many
a dark and devious thicket, till they were astonished by the horrid
phantoms of Cerinthus and Apollinaris, who guarded the opposite issues
of the theological labyrinth. As soon as they beheld the twilight of
sense and heresy, they started, measured back their steps, and were
again involved in the gloom of impenetrable orthodoxy. To purge
themselves from the guilt or reproach of damnable error, they
disavowed their consequences, explained their principles, excused their
indiscretions, and unanimously pronounced the sounds of concord and
faith. Yet a latent and almost invisible spark still lurked among the
embers of controversy: by the breath of prejudice and passion, it was
quickly kindled to a mighty flame, and the verbal disputes [19] of the
Oriental sects have shaken the pillars of the church and state.

[Footnote 19: I appeal to the confession of two Oriental prelates,
Gregory Abulpharagius the Jacobite primate of the East, and Elias the
Nestorian metropolitan of Damascus, (see Asseman, Bibliothec. Oriental.
tom. ii. p. 291, tom. iii. p. 514, &c.,) that the Melchites, Jacobites,
Nestorians, &c., agree in the doctrine, and differ only in the
expression. Our most learned and rational divines--Basnage, Le Clerc,
Beausobre, La Croze, Mosheim, Jablonski--are inclined to favor this
charitable judgment; but the zeal of Petavius is loud and angry, and the
moderation of Dupin is conveyed in a whisper.]

The name of Cyril of Alexandria is famous in controversial story,
and the title of saint is a mark that his opinions and his party have
finally prevailed. In the house of his uncle, the archbishop Theophilus,
he imbibed the orthodox lessons of zeal and dominion, and five years of
his youth were profitably spent in the adjacent monasteries of
Nitria. Under the tuition of the abbot Serapion, he applied himself
to ecclesiastical studies, with such indefatigable ardor, that in the
course of one sleepless night, he has perused the four Gospels, the
Catholic Epistles, and the Epistle to the Romans. Origen he detested;
but the writings of Clemens and Dionysius, of Athanasius and Basil, were
continually in his hands: by the theory and practice of dispute, his
faith was confirmed and his wit was sharpened; he extended round his
cell the cobwebs of scholastic theology, and meditated the works of
allegory and metaphysics, whose remains, in seven verbose folios, now
peaceably slumber by the side of their rivals. [20] Cyril prayed and
fasted in the desert, but his thoughts (it is the reproach of a friend)
[21] were still fixed on the world; and the call of Theophilus, who
summoned him to the tumult of cities and synods, was too readily obeyed
by the aspiring hermit. With the approbation of his uncle, he assumed
the office, and acquired the fame, of a popular preacher. His comely
person adorned the pulpit; the harmony of his voice resounded in the
cathedral; his friends were stationed to lead or second the applause of
the congregation; [22] and the hasty notes of the scribes preserved
his discourses, which in their effect, though not in their composition,
might be compared with those of the Athenian orators. The death of
Theophilus expanded and realized the hopes of his nephew. The clergy
of Alexandria was divided; the soldiers and their general supported the
claims of the archdeacon; but a resistless multitude, with voices and
with hands, asserted the cause of their favorite; and after a period of
thirty-nine years, Cyril was seated on the throne of Athanasius. [23]

[Footnote 20: La Croze (Hist. du Christianisme des Indes, tom. i. p. 24)
avows his contempt for the genius and writings of Cyril. De tous les on
vrages des anciens, il y en a peu qu'on lise avec moins d'utilite: and
Dupin, (Bibliotheque Ecclesiastique, tom. iv. p. 42--52,) in words of
respect, teaches us to despise them.]

[Footnote 21: Of Isidore of Pelusium, (l. i. epist. 25, p. 8.) As the
letter is not of the most creditable sort, Tillemont, less sincere than
the Bollandists, affects a doubt whether this Cyril is the nephew of
Theophilus, (Mem. Eccles. tom. xiv. p. 268.)]

[Footnote 22: A grammarian is named by Socrates (l. vii. c. 13).]

[Footnote 23: See the youth and promotion of Cyril, in Socrates, (l.
vii. c. 7) and Renaudot, (Hist. Patriarchs. Alexandrin. p. 106, 108.)
The Abbe Renaudot drew his materials from the Arabic history of Severus,
bishop of Hermopolis Magma, or Ashmunein, in the xth century, who can
never be trusted, unless our assent is extorted by the internal evidence
of facts.]
