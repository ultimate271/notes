## Chapter XXVI: Progress of The Huns.--Part III.

After Valens had terminated the Gothic war with some appearance of glory
and success, he made a progress through his dominions of Asia, and at
length fixed his residence in the capital of Syria. The five years [63]
which he spent at Antioch was employed to watch, from a secure distance,
the hostile designs of the Persian monarch; to check the depredations of
the Saracens and Isaurians; [64] to enforce, by arguments more prevalent
than those of reason and eloquence, the belief of the Arian theology;
and to satisfy his anxious suspicions by the promiscuous execution of
the innocent and the guilty. But the attention of the emperor was most
seriously engaged, by the important intelligence which he received from
the civil and military officers who were intrusted with the defence of
the Danube. He was informed, that the North was agitated by a furious
tempest; that the irruption of the Huns, an unknown and monstrous race
of savages, had subverted the power of the Goths; and that the suppliant
multitudes of that warlike nation, whose pride was now humbled in the
dust, covered a space of many miles along the banks of the river. With
outstretched arms, and pathetic lamentations, they loudly deplored their
past misfortunes and their present danger; acknowledged that their only
hope of safety was in the clemency of the Roman government; and most
solemnly protested, that if the gracious liberality of the emperor would
permit them to cultivate the waste lands of Thrace, they should
ever hold themselves bound, by the strongest obligations of duty and
gratitude, to obey the laws, and to guard the limits, of the republic.
These assurances were confirmed by the ambassadors of the Goths, [64a]
who impatiently expected from the mouth of Valens an answer that must
finally determine the fate of their unhappy countrymen. The emperor of
the East was no longer guided by the wisdom and authority of his elder
brother, whose death happened towards the end of the preceding year;
and as the distressful situation of the Goths required an instant and
peremptory decision, he was deprived of the favorite resources of feeble
and timid minds, who consider the use of dilatory and ambiguous measures
as the most admirable efforts of consummate prudence. As long as the
same passions and interests subsist among mankind, the questions of war
and peace, of justice and policy, which were debated in the councils of
antiquity, will frequently present themselves as the subject of modern
deliberation. But the most experienced statesman of Europe has never
been summoned to consider the propriety, or the danger, of admitting,
or rejecting, an innumerable multitude of Barbarians, who are driven
by despair and hunger to solicit a settlement on the territories of
a civilized nation. When that important proposition, so essentially
connected with the public safety, was referred to the ministers of
Valens, they were perplexed and divided; but they soon acquiesced in the
flattering sentiment which seemed the most favorable to the pride, the
indolence, and the avarice of their sovereign. The slaves, who were
decorated with the titles of praefects and generals, dissembled or
disregarded the terrors of this national emigration; so extremely
different from the partial and accidental colonies, which had been
received on the extreme limits of the empire. But they applauded the
liberality of fortune, which had conducted, from the most distant
countries of the globe, a numerous and invincible army of strangers, to
defend the throne of Valens; who might now add to the royal treasures
the immense sums of gold supplied by the provincials to compensate their
annual proportion of recruits. The prayers of the Goths were granted,
and their service was accepted by the Imperial court: and orders were
immediately despatched to the civil and military governors of the
Thracian diocese, to make the necessary preparations for the passage and
subsistence of a great people, till a proper and sufficient territory
could be allotted for their future residence. The liberality of
the emperor was accompanied, however, with two harsh and rigorous
conditions, which prudence might justify on the side of the Romans; but
which distress alone could extort from the indignant Goths. Before they
passed the Danube, they were required to deliver their arms: and it was
insisted, that their children should be taken from them, and dispersed
through the provinces of Asia; where they might be civilized by the
arts of education, and serve as hostages to secure the fidelity of their
parents.

Tillemont has labored to clear and settle the annals of Valens.]

was one of these ambassadors.--M.]

During the suspense of a doubtful and distant negotiation, the impatient
Goths made some rash attempts to pass the Danube, without the permission
of the government, whose protection they had implored. Their motions
were strictly observed by the vigilance of the troops which were
stationed along the river and their foremost detachments were defeated
with considerable slaughter; yet such were the timid councils of the
reign of Valens, that the brave officers who had served their country
in the execution of their duty, were punished by the loss of their
employments, and narrowly escaped the loss of their heads. The Imperial
mandate was at length received for transporting over the Danube the
whole body of the Gothic nation; [65] but the execution of this order
was a task of labor and difficulty. The stream of the Danube, which in
those parts is above a mile broad, [66] had been swelled by incessant
rains; and in this tumultuous passage, many were swept away, and
drowned, by the rapid violence of the current. A large fleet of vessels,
of boats, and of canoes, was provided; many days and nights they passed
and repassed with indefatigable toil; and the most strenuous diligence
was exerted by the officers of Valens, that not a single Barbarian, of
those who were reserved to subvert the foundations of Rome, should be
left on the opposite shore. It was thought expedient that an accurate
account should be taken of their numbers; but the persons who were
employed soon desisted, with amazement and dismay, from the prosecution
of the endless and impracticable task: [67] and the principal historian
of the age most seriously affirms, that the prodigious armies of Darius
and Xerxes, which had so long been considered as the fables of vain and
credulous antiquity, were now justified, in the eyes of mankind, by
the evidence of fact and experience. A probable testimony has fixed the
number of the Gothic warriors at two hundred thousand men: and if we can
venture to add the just proportion of women, of children, and of slaves,
the whole mass of people which composed this formidable emigration, must
have amounted to near a million of persons, of both sexes, and of all
ages. The children of the Goths, those at least of a distinguished rank,
were separated from the multitude. They were conducted, without delay,
to the distant seats assigned for their residence and education; and as
the numerous train of hostages or captives passed through the cities,
their gay and splendid apparel, their robust and martial figure, excited
the surprise and envy of the Provincials. [67a] But the stipulation, the
most offensive to the Goths, and the most important to the Romans, was
shamefully eluded. The Barbarians, who considered their arms as the
ensigns of honor and the pledges of safety, were disposed to offer a
price, which the lust or avarice of the Imperial officers was easily
tempted to accept. To preserve their arms, the haughty warriors
consented, with some reluctance, to prostitute their wives or their
daughters; the charms of a beauteous maid, or a comely boy, secured the
connivance of the inspectors; who sometimes cast an eye of covetousness
on the fringed carpets and linen garments of their new allies, [68] or
who sacrificed their duty to the mean consideration of filling their
farms with cattle, and their houses with slaves. The Goths, with arms in
their hands, were permitted to enter the boats; and when their strength
was collected on the other side of the river, the immense camp which
was spread over the plains and the hills of the Lower Maesia, assumed
a threatening and even hostile aspect. The leaders of the Ostrogoths,
Alatheus and Saphrax, the guardians of their infant king, appeared
soon afterwards on the Northern banks of the Danube; and immediately
despatched their ambassadors to the court of Antioch, to solicit, with
the same professions of allegiance and gratitude, the same favor which
had been granted to the suppliant Visigoths. The absolute refusal of
Valens suspended their progress, and discovered the repentance, the
suspicions, and the fears, of the Imperial council.

[Footnote 65: The passage of the Danube is exposed by Ammianus, (xxxi.
3, 4,) Zosimus, (l. iv. p. 223, 224,) Eunapius in Excerpt. Legat. (p.
19, 20,) and Jornandes, (c. 25, 26.) Ammianus declares (c. 5) that he
means only, ispas rerum digerere summitates. But he often takes a
false measure of their importance; and his superfluous prolixity is
disagreeably balanced by his unseasonable brevity.]

[Footnote 66: Chishull, a curious traveller, has remarked the breadth of
the Danube, which he passed to the south of Bucharest near the conflux
of the Argish, (p. 77.) He admires the beauty and spontaneous plenty of
Maesia, or Bulgaria.]

[Footnote 67:

     Quem sci scire velit, Libyci velit aequoris idem
     Discere quam multae Zephyro turbentur harenae.

Ammianus has inserted, in his prose, these lines of Virgil, (Georgia l.
ii. 105,) originally designed by the poet to express the impossibility
of numbering the different sorts of vines. See Plin. Hist. Natur l.
xiv.]

[Footnote 67a: A very curious, but obscure, passage of Eunapius,
appears to me to have been misunderstood by M. Mai, to whom we owe its
discovery. The substance is as follows: "The Goths transported over
the river their native deities, with their priests of both sexes; but
concerning their rites they maintained a deep and 'adamantine silence.'
To the Romans they pretended to be generally Christians, and placed
certain persons to represent bishops in a conspicuous manner on their
wagons. There was even among them a sort of what are called monks,
persons whom it was not difficult to mimic; it was enough to wear
black raiment, to be wicked, and held in respect." (Eunapius hated the
"black-robed monks," as appears in another passage, with the cordial
detestation of a heathen philosopher.) "Thus, while they faithfully but
secretly adhered to their own religion, the Romans were weak enough to
suppose them perfect Christians." Mai, 277. Eunapius in Niebuhr, 82.--M]

[Footnote 68: Eunapius and Zosimus curiously specify these articles of
Gothic wealth and luxury. Yet it must be presumed, that they were the
manufactures of the provinces; which the Barbarians had acquired as the
spoils of war; or as the gifts, or merchandise, of peace.]

An undisciplined and unsettled nation of Barbarians required the firmest
temper, and the most dexterous management. The daily subsistence of near
a million of extraordinary subjects could be supplied only by constant
and skilful diligence, and might continually be interrupted by mistake
or accident. The insolence, or the indignation, of the Goths, if they
conceived themselves to be the objects either of fear or of contempt,
might urge them to the most desperate extremities; and the fortune of
the state seemed to depend on the prudence, as well as the integrity,
of the generals of Valens. At this important crisis, the military
government of Thrace was exercised by Lupicinus and Maximus, in whose
venal minds the slightest hope of private emolument outweighed every
consideration of public advantage; and whose guilt was only alleviated
by their incapacity of discerning the pernicious effects of their rash
and criminal administration.

Instead of obeying the orders of their sovereign, and satisfying, with
decent liberality, the demands of the Goths, they levied an ungenerous
and oppressive tax on the wants of the hungry Barbarians. The vilest
food was sold at an extravagant price; and, in the room of wholesome and
substantial provisions, the markets were filled with the flesh of dogs,
and of unclean animals, who had died of disease. To obtain the valuable
acquisition of a pound of bread, the Goths resigned the possession of an
expensive, though serviceable, slave; and a small quantity of meat was
greedily purchased with ten pounds of a precious, but useless metal,
[69] when their property was exhausted, they continued this necessary
traffic by the sale of their sons and daughters; and notwithstanding the
love of freedom, which animated every Gothic breast, they submitted
to the humiliating maxim, that it was better for their children to be
maintained in a servile condition, than to perish in a state of wretched
and helpless independence. The most lively resentment is excited by
the tyranny of pretended benefactors, who sternly exact the debt of
gratitude which they have cancelled by subsequent injuries: a spirit of
discontent insensibly arose in the camp of the Barbarians, who pleaded,
without success, the merit of their patient and dutiful behavior; and
loudly complained of the inhospitable treatment which they had received
from their new allies. They beheld around them the wealth and plenty of
a fertile province, in the midst of which they suffered the intolerable
hardships of artificial famine. But the means of relief, and even of
revenge, were in their hands; since the rapaciousness of their tyrants
had left to an injured people the possession and the use of arms. The
clamors of a multitude, untaught to disguise their sentiments, announced
the first symptoms of resistance, and alarmed the timid and guilty minds
of Lupicinus and Maximus. Those crafty ministers, who substituted the
cunning of temporary expedients to the wise and salutary counsels of
general policy, attempted to remove the Goths from their dangerous
station on the frontiers of the empire; and to disperse them, in
separate quarters of cantonment, through the interior provinces. As they
were conscious how ill they had deserved the respect, or confidence, of
the Barbarians, they diligently collected, from every side, a military
force, that might urge the tardy and reluctant march of a people, who
had not yet renounced the title, or the duties, of Roman subjects. But
the generals of Valens, while their attention was solely directed to
the discontented Visigoths, imprudently disarmed the ships and the
fortifications which constituted the defence of the Danube. The fatal
oversight was observed, and improved, by Alatheus and Saphrax, who
anxiously watched the favorable moment of escaping from the pursuit
of the Huns. By the help of such rafts and vessels as could be hastily
procured, the leaders of the Ostrogoths transported, without opposition,
their king and their army; and boldly fixed a hostile and independent
camp on the territories of the empire. [70]

[Footnote 69: Decem libras; the word silver must be understood.
Jornandes betrays the passions and prejudices of a Goth. The servile
Geeks, Eunapius and Zosimus, disguise the Roman oppression, and execrate
the perfidy of the Barbarians. Ammianus, a patriot historian, slightly,
and reluctantly, touches on the odious subject. Jerom, who wrote almost
on the spot, is fair, though concise. Per avaritaim aximi ducis, ad
rebellionem fame coacti sunt, (in Chron.) * Note: A new passage from
the history of Eunapius is nearer to the truth. 'It appeared to our
commanders a legitimate source of gain to be bribed by the Barbarians:

[Footnote 70: Ammianus, xxxi. 4, 5.]

Under the name of Judges, Alavivus and Fritigern were the leaders of the
Visigoths in peace and war; and the authority which they derived from
their birth was ratified by the free consent of the nation. In a season
of tranquility, their power might have been equal, as well as their
rank; but, as soon as their countrymen were exasperated by hunger and
oppression, the superior abilities of Fritigern assumed the military
command, which he was qualified to exercise for the public welfare. He
restrained the impatient spirit of the Visigoths till the injuries and
the insults of their tyrants should justify their resistance in the
opinion of mankind: but he was not disposed to sacrifice any solid
advantages for the empty praise of justice and moderation. Sensible
of the benefits which would result from the union of the Gothic powers
under the same standard, he secretly cultivated the friendship of the
Ostrogoths; and while he professed an implicit obedience to the
orders of the Roman generals, he proceeded by slow marches towards
Marcianopolis, the capital of the Lower Maesia, about seventy miles from
the banks of the Danube. On that fatal spot, the flames of discord and
mutual hatred burst forth into a dreadful conflagration. Lupicinus had
invited the Gothic chiefs to a splendid entertainment; and their martial
train remained under arms at the entrance of the palace. But the gates
of the city were strictly guarded, and the Barbarians were sternly
excluded from the use of a plentiful market, to which they asserted
their equal claim of subjects and allies. Their humble prayers were
rejected with insolence and derision; and as their patience was now
exhausted, the townsmen, the soldiers, and the Goths, were soon involved
in a conflict of passionate altercation and angry reproaches. A blow was
imprudently given; a sword was hastily drawn; and the first blood that
was spilt in this accidental quarrel, became the signal of a long
and destructive war. In the midst of noise and brutal intemperance,
Lupicinus was informed, by a secret messenger, that many of his soldiers
were slain, and despoiled of their arms; and as he was already inflamed
by wine, and oppressed by sleep he issued a rash command, that their
death should be revenged by the massacre of the guards of Fritigern and
Alavivus.

The clamorous shouts and dying groans apprised Fritigern of his extreme
danger; and, as he possessed the calm and intrepid spirit of a hero, he
saw that he was lost if he allowed a moment of deliberation to the man
who had so deeply injured him. "A trifling dispute," said the Gothic
leader, with a firm but gentle tone of voice, "appears to have arisen
between the two nations; but it may be productive of the most dangerous
consequences, unless the tumult is immediately pacified by the assurance
of our safety, and the authority of our presence." At these words,
Fritigern and his companions drew their swords, opened their passage
through the unresisting crowd, which filled the palace, the streets,
and the gates, of Marcianopolis, and, mounting their horses, hastily
vanished from the eyes of the astonished Romans. The generals of the
Goths were saluted by the fierce and joyful acclamations of the camp;
war was instantly resolved, and the resolution was executed without
delay: the banners of the nation were displayed according to the custom
of their ancestors; and the air resounded with the harsh and mournful
music of the Barbarian trumpet. [71] The weak and guilty Lupicinus,
who had dared to provoke, who had neglected to destroy, and who still
presumed to despise, his formidable enemy, marched against the Goths, at
the head of such a military force as could be collected on this sudden
emergency. The Barbarians expected his approach about nine miles from
Marcianopolis; and on this occasion the talents of the general were
found to be of more prevailing efficacy than the weapons and discipline
of the troops. The valor of the Goths was so ably directed by the genius
of Fritigern, that they broke, by a close and vigorous attack, the
ranks of the Roman legions. Lupicinus left his arms and standards, his
tribunes and his bravest soldiers, on the field of battle; and their
useless courage served only to protect the ignominious flight of
their leader. "That successful day put an end to the distress of the
Barbarians, and the security of the Romans: from that day, the Goths,
renouncing the precarious condition of strangers and exiles, assumed the
character of citizens and masters, claimed an absolute dominion over the
possessors of land, and held, in their own right, the northern provinces
of the empire, which are bounded by the Danube." Such are the words
of the Gothic historian, [72] who celebrates, with rude eloquence,
the glory of his countrymen. But the dominion of the Barbarians was
exercised only for the purposes of rapine and destruction. As they had
been deprived, by the ministers of the emperor, of the common benefits
of nature, and the fair intercourse of social life, they retaliated the
injustice on the subjects of the empire; and the crimes of Lupicinus
were expiated by the ruin of the peaceful husbandmen of Thrace, the
conflagration of their villages, and the massacre, or captivity, of
their innocent families. The report of the Gothic victory was soon
diffused over the adjacent country; and while it filled the minds of the
Romans with terror and dismay, their own hasty imprudence contributed
to increase the forces of Fritigern, and the calamities of the province.
Some time before the great emigration, a numerous body of Goths, under
the command of Suerid and Colias, had been received into the protection
and service of the empire. [73] They were encamped under the walls of
Hadrianople; but the ministers of Valens were anxious to remove them
beyond the Hellespont, at a distance from the dangerous temptation which
might so easily be communicated by the neighborhood, and the success, of
their countrymen. The respectful submission with which they yielded
to the order of their march, might be considered as a proof of their
fidelity; and their moderate request of a sufficient allowance of
provisions, and of a delay of only two days was expressed in the most
dutiful terms. But the first magistrate of Hadrianople, incensed by some
disorders which had been committed at his country-house, refused this
indulgence; and arming against them the inhabitants and manufacturers
of a populous city, he urged, with hostile threats, their instant
departure. The Barbarians stood silent and amazed, till they were
exasperated by the insulting clamors, and missile weapons, of the
populace: but when patience or contempt was fatigued, they crushed the
undisciplined multitude, inflicted many a shameful wound on the backs
of their flying enemies, and despoiled them of the splendid armor, [74]
which they were unworthy to bear. The resemblance of their sufferings
and their actions soon united this victorious detachment to the nation
of the Visigoths; the troops of Colias and Suerid expected the approach
of the great Fritigern, ranged themselves under his standard, and
signalized their ardor in the siege of Hadrianople. But the resistance
of the garrison informed the Barbarians, that in the attack of regular
fortifications, the efforts of unskillful courage are seldom effectual.
Their general acknowledged his error, raised the siege, declared that
"he was at peace with stone walls," [75] and revenged his disappointment
on the adjacent country. He accepted, with pleasure, the useful
reenforcement of hardy workmen, who labored in the gold mines of Thrace,
[76] for the emolument, and under the lash, of an unfeeling master: [77]
and these new associates conducted the Barbarians, through the secret
paths, to the most sequestered places, which had been chosen to secure
the inhabitants, the cattle, and the magazines of corn. With the
assistance of such guides, nothing could remain impervious or
inaccessible; resistance was fatal; flight was impracticable; and the
patient submission of helpless innocence seldom found mercy from the
Barbarian conqueror. In the course of these depredations, a great number
of the children of the Goths, who had been sold into captivity, were
restored to the embraces of their afflicted parents; but these tender
interviews, which might have revived and cherished in their minds some
sentiments of humanity, tended only to stimulate their native fierceness
by the desire of revenge. They listened, with eager attention, to the
complaints of their captive children, who had suffered the most cruel
indignities from the lustful or angry passions of their masters, and the
same cruelties, the same indignities, were severely retaliated on the
sons and daughters of the Romans. [78]

inroads of the Barbarians.]

The imprudence of Valens and his ministers had introduced into the heart
of the empire a nation of enemies; but the Visigoths might even yet have
been reconciled, by the manly confession of past errors, and the sincere
performance of former engagements. These healing and temperate measures
seemed to concur with the timorous disposition of the sovereign of
the East: but, on this occasion alone, Valens was brave; and his
unseasonable bravery was fatal to himself and to his subjects. He
declared his intention of marching from Antioch to Constantinople, to
subdue this dangerous rebellion; and, as he was not ignorant of the
difficulties of the enterprise, he solicited the assistance of his
nephew, the emperor Gratian, who commanded all the forces of the West.
The veteran troops were hastily recalled from the defence of Armenia;
that important frontier was abandoned to the discretion of Sapor;
and the immediate conduct of the Gothic war was intrusted, during
the absence of Valens, to his lieutenants Trajan and Profuturus, two
generals who indulged themselves in a very false and favorable opinion
of their own abilities. On their arrival in Thrace, they were joined by
Richomer, count of the domestics; and the auxiliaries of the West, that
marched under his banner, were composed of the Gallic legions, reduced
indeed, by a spirit of desertion, to the vain appearances of strength
and numbers. In a council of war, which was influenced by pride,
rather than by reason, it was resolved to seek, and to encounter, the
Barbarians, who lay encamped in the spacious and fertile meadows, near
the most southern of the six mouths of the Danube. [79] Their camp
was surrounded by the usual fortification of wagons; [80] and the
Barbarians, secure within the vast circle of the enclosure, enjoyed the
fruits of their valor, and the spoils of the province. In the midst of
riotous intemperance, the watchful Fritigern observed the motions, and
penetrated the designs, of the Romans. He perceived, that the numbers
of the enemy were continually increasing: and, as he understood their
intention of attacking his rear, as soon as the scarcity of forage
should oblige him to remove his camp, he recalled to their standard his
predatory detachments, which covered the adjacent country. As soon as
they descried the flaming beacons, [81] they obeyed, with incredible
speed, the signal of their leader: the camp was filled with the martial
crowd of Barbarians; their impatient clamors demanded the battle, and
their tumultuous zeal was approved and animated by the spirit of
their chiefs. The evening was already far advanced; and the two armies
prepared themselves for the approaching combat, which was deferred only
till the dawn of day.

While the trumpets sounded to arms, the undaunted courage of the Goths
was confirmed by the mutual obligation of a solemn oath; and as they
advanced to meet the enemy, the rude songs, which celebrated the glory
of their forefathers, were mingled with their fierce and dissonant
outcries, and opposed to the artificial harmony of the Roman shout. Some
military skill was displayed by Fritigern to gain the advantage of a
commanding eminence; but the bloody conflict, which began and ended with
the light, was maintained on either side, by the personal and obstinate
efforts of strength, valor, and agility. The legions of Armenia
supported their fame in arms; but they were oppressed by the
irresistible weight of the hostile multitude the left wing of the Romans
was thrown into disorder and the field was strewed with their mangled
carcasses. This partial defeat was balanced, however, by partial
success; and when the two armies, at a late hour of the evening,
retreated to their respective camps, neither of them could claim the
honors, or the effects, of a decisive victory. The real loss was more
severely felt by the Romans, in proportion to the smallness of their
numbers; but the Goths were so deeply confounded and dismayed by this
vigorous, and perhaps unexpected, resistance, that they remained seven
days within the circle of their fortifications. Such funeral rites, as
the circumstances of time and place would admit, were piously discharged
to some officers of distinguished rank; but the indiscriminate vulgar
was left unburied on the plain. Their flesh was greedily devoured by
the birds of prey, who in that age enjoyed very frequent and delicious
feasts; and several years afterwards the white and naked bones, which
covered the wide extent of the fields, presented to the eyes of Ammianus
a dreadful monument of the battle of Salices. [82]

[Footnote 79: The Itinerary of Antoninus (p. 226, 227, edit. Wesseling)
marks the situation of this place about sixty miles north of Tomi,
Ovid's exile; and the name of Salices (the willows) expresses the nature
of the soil.]

fortification of the Barbarians. (Vegetius de Re Militari, l. iii.

preserved by their descendants as late as the fifteenth century. The
Charroy, which surrounded the Ost, is a word familiar to the readers of
Froissard, or Comines.]

disfigure to style of Ammianus.]

as a traveller. But his modesty has suppressed the adventures of his own
life subsequent to the Persian wars of Constantius and Julian. We are
ignorant of the time when he quitted the service, and retired to Rome,
where he appears to have composed his History of his Own Times.]

The progress of the Goths had been checked by the doubtful event of
that bloody day; and the Imperial generals, whose army would have been
consumed by the repetition of such a contest, embraced the more rational
plan of destroying the Barbarians by the wants and pressure of their own
multitudes. They prepared to confine the Visigoths in the narrow angle
of land between the Danube, the desert of Scythia, and the mountains of
Haemus, till their strength and spirit should be insensibly wasted by
the inevitable operation of famine. The design was prosecuted with
some conduct and success: the Barbarians had almost exhausted their
own magazines, and the harvests of the country; and the diligence of
Saturninus, the master-general of the cavalry, was employed to improve
the strength, and to contract the extent, of the Roman fortifications.
His labors were interrupted by the alarming intelligence, that new
swarms of Barbarians had passed the unguarded Danube, either to
support the cause, or to imitate the example, of Fritigern. The just
apprehension, that he himself might be surrounded, and overwhelmed,
by the arms of hostile and unknown nations, compelled Saturninus to
relinquish the siege of the Gothic camp; and the indignant Visigoths,
breaking from their confinement, satiated their hunger and revenge by
the repeated devastation of the fruitful country, which extends above
three hundred miles from the banks of the Danube to the straits of the
Hellespont. [83] The sagacious Fritigern had successfully appealed to
the passions, as well as to the interest, of his Barbarian allies; and
the love of rapine, and the hatred of Rome, seconded, or even prevented,
the eloquence of his ambassadors. He cemented a strict and useful
alliance with the great body of his countrymen, who obeyed Alatheus and
Saphrax as the guardians of their infant king: the long animosity of
rival tribes was suspended by the sense of their common interest; the
independent part of the nation was associated under one standard; and
the chiefs of the Ostrogoths appear to have yielded to the superior
genius of the general of the Visigoths. He obtained the formidable aid
of the Taifalae, [83a] whose military renown was disgraced and polluted
by the public infamy of their domestic manners. Every youth, on his
entrance into the world, was united by the ties of honorable friendship,
and brutal love, to some warrior of the tribe; nor could he hope to
be released from this unnatural connection, till he had approved his
manhood by slaying, in single combat, a huge bear, or a wild boar of the
forest. [84] But the most powerful auxiliaries of the Goths were drawn
from the camp of those enemies who had expelled them from their native
seats. The loose subordination, and extensive possessions, of the Huns
and the Alani, delayed the conquests, and distracted the councils, of
that victorious people. Several of the hords were allured by the liberal
promises of Fritigern; and the rapid cavalry of Scythia added weight and
energy to the steady and strenuous efforts of the Gothic infantry.
The Sarmatians, who could never forgive the successor of Valentinian,
enjoyed and increased the general confusion; and a seasonable irruption
of the Alemanni, into the provinces of Gaul, engaged the attention, and
diverted the forces, of the emperor of the West. [85]

[Footnote 83a: The Taifalae, who at this period inhabited the country
which now forms the principality of Wallachia, were, in my opinion, the
last remains of the great and powerful nation of the Dacians, (Daci or
Dahae.) which has given its name to these regions, over which they had
ruled so long. The Taifalae passed with the Goths into the territory of
the empire. A great number of them entered the Roman service, and were
quartered in different provinces. They are mentioned in the Notitia
Imperii. There was a considerable body in the country of the Pictavi,
now Poithou. They long retained their manners and language, and caused
the name of the Theofalgicus pagus to be given to the district they
inhabited. Two places in the department of La Vendee, Tiffanges and La
Tiffardiere, still preserve evident traces of this denomination. St.
Martin, iv. 118.--M.]

Greeks, likewise, more especially among the Cretans, the holy bands of
friendship were confirmed, and sullied, by unnatural love.]
