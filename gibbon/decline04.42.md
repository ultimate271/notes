## Chapter XLVII: Ecclesiastical Discord.--Part VI.

A more important conquest still remained, of the patriarch, the oracle
and leader of the Egyptian church. Theodosius had resisted the
threats and promises of Justinian with the spirit of an apostle or
an enthusiast. "Such," replied the patriarch, "were the offers of the
tempter when he showed the kingdoms of the earth. But my soul is far
dearer to me than life or dominion. The churches are in the hands of a
prince who can kill the body; but my conscience is my own; and in exile,
poverty, or chains, I will steadfastly adhere to the faith of my holy
predecessors, Athanasius, Cyril, and Dioscorus. Anathema to the tome of
Leo and the synod of Chalcedon! Anathema to all who embrace their creed!
Anathema to them now and forevermore! Naked came I out of my mother's
womb, naked shall I descend into the grave. Let those who love God
follow me and seek their salvation." After comforting his brethren,
he embarked for Constantinople, and sustained, in six successive
interviews, the almost irresistible weight of the royal presence. His
opinions were favorably entertained in the palace and the city;
the influence of Theodora assured him a safe conduct and honorable
dismission; and he ended his days, though not on the throne, yet in
the bosom, of his native country. On the news of his death, Apollinaris
indecently feasted the nobles and the clergy; but his joy was checked by
the intelligence of a new election; and while he enjoyed the wealth of
Alexandria, his rivals reigned in the monasteries of Thebais, and
were maintained by the voluntary oblations of the people. A perpetual
succession of patriarchs arose from the ashes of Theodosius; and the
Monophysite churches of Syria and Egypt were united by the name of
Jacobites and the communion of the faith. But the same faith, which has
been confined to a narrow sect of the Syrians, was diffused over the
mass of the Egyptian or Coptic nation; who, almost unanimously, rejected
the decrees of the synod of Chalcedon. A thousand years were now elapsed
since Egypt had ceased to be a kingdom, since the conquerors of Asia and
Europe had trampled on the ready necks of a people, whose ancient wisdom
and power ascend beyond the records of history. The conflict of zeal
and persecution rekindled some sparks of their national spirit. They
abjured, with a foreign heresy, the manners and language of the Greeks:
every Melchite, in their eyes, was a stranger, every Jacobite a citizen;
the alliance of marriage, the offices of humanity, were condemned as a
deadly sin the natives renounced all allegiance to the emperor; and
his orders, at a distance from Alexandria, were obeyed only under the
pressure of military force. A generous effort might have edeemed the
religion and liberty of Egypt, and her six hundred monasteries might
have poured forth their myriads of holy warriors, for whom death should
have no terrors, since life had no comfort or delight. But experience
has proved the distinction of active and passive courage; the fanatic
who endures without a groan the torture of the rack or the stake, would
tremble and fly before the face of an armed enemy. The pusillanimous
temper of the Egyptians could only hope for a change of masters; the
arms of Chosroes depopulated the land, yet under his reign the Jacobites
enjoyed a short and precarious respite. The victory of Heraclius renewed
and aggravated the persecution, and the patriarch again escaped from
Alexandria to the desert. In his flight, Benjamin was encouraged by
a voice, which bade him expect, at the end of ten years, the aid of a
foreign nation, marked, like the Egyptians themselves, with the ancient
rite of circumcision. The character of these deliverers, and the nature
of the deliverance, will be hereafter explained; and I shall step over
the interval of eleven centuries to observe the present misery of the
Jacobites of Egypt. The populous city of Cairo affords a residence, or
rather a shelter, for their indigent patriarch, and a remnant of ten
bishops; forty monasteries have survived the inroads of the Arabs; and
the progress of servitude and apostasy has reduced the Coptic nation to
the despicable number of twenty-five or thirty thousand families; [148]
a race of illiterate beggars, whose only consolation is derived from
the superior wretchedness of the Greek patriarch and his diminutive
congregation. [149]

[Footnote 148: This number is taken from the curious Recherches sur
les Egyptiens et les Chinois, (tom. ii. p. 192, 193,) and appears more
probable than the 600,000 ancient, or 15,000 modern, Copts of Gemelli
Carreri Cyril Lucar, the Protestant patriarch of Constantinople, laments
that those heretics were ten times more numerous than his orthodox
Greeks, ingeniously applying Homer, (Iliad, ii. 128,) the most perfect
expression of contempt, (Fabric. Lux Evangelii, 740.)]

[Footnote 149: The history of the Copts, their religion, manners, &c.,
may be found in the Abbe Renaudot's motley work, neither a translation
nor an original; the Chronicon Orientale of Peter, a Jacobite; in
the two versions of Abraham Ecchellensis, Paris, 1651; and John Simon
Asseman, Venet. 1729. These annals descend no lower than the xiiith
century. The more recent accounts must be searched for in the travellers
into Egypt and the Nouveaux Memoires des Missions du Levant. In the last
century, Joseph Abudacnus, a native of Cairo, published at Oxford, in
thirty pages, a slight Historia Jacobitarum, 147, post p.150]

VI. The Coptic patriarch, a rebel to the Caesars, or a slave to the
khalifs, still gloried in the filial obedience of the kings of Nubia and
Aethiopia. He repaid their homage by magnifying their greatness; and
it was boldly asserted that they could bring into the field a hundred
thousand horse, with an equal number of camels; [150] that their hand
could pour out or restrain the waters of the Nile; [151] and the
peace and plenty of Egypt was obtained, even in this world, by the
intercession of the patriarch. In exile at Constantinople, Theodosius
recommended to his patroness the conversion of the black nations of
Nubia, from the tropic of Cancer to the confines of Abyssinia. [152]
Her design was suspected and emulated by the more orthodox emperor.
The rival missionaries, a Melchite and a Jacobite, embarked at the
same time; but the empress, from a motive of love or fear, was more
effectually obeyed; and the Catholic priest was detained by the
president of Thebais, while the king of Nubia and his court were hastily
baptized in the faith of Dioscorus. The tardy envoy of Justinian was
received and dismissed with honor: but when he accused the heresy and
treason of the Egyptians, the negro convert was instructed to reply
that he would never abandon his brethren, the true believers, to the
persecuting ministers of the synod of Chalcedon. [153] During several
ages, the bishops of Nubia were named and consecrated by the Jacobite
patriarch of Alexandria: as late as the twelfth century, Christianity
prevailed; and some rites, some ruins, are still visible in the savage
towns of Sennaar and Dongola. [154] But the Nubians at length executed
their threats of returning to the worship of idols; the climate required
the indulgence of polygamy, and they have finally preferred the triumph
of the Koran to the abasement of the Cross. A metaphysical religion may
appear too refined for the capacity of the negro race: yet a black or
a parrot might be taught to repeat the words of the Chalcedonian or
Monophysite creed.

[Footnote 150: About the year 737. See Renaudot, Hist. Patriarch. Alex
p. 221, 222. Elmacin, Hist. Saracen. p. 99.]

[Footnote 151: Ludolph. Hist. Aethiopic. et Comment. l. i. c. 8.
Renaudot Hist. Patriarch. Alex. p. 480, &c. This opinion, introduced
into Egypt and Europe by the artifice of the Copts, the pride of the
Abyssinians, the fear and ignorance of the Turks and Arabs, has not even
the semblance of truth. The rains of Aethiopia do not, in the increase
of the Nile, consult the will of the monarch. If the river approaches at
Napata within three days' journey of the Red Sea (see D'Anville's Maps,)
a canal that should divert its course would demand, and most probably
surpass, the power of the Caesars.]

[Footnote 152: The Abyssinians, who still preserve the features and
olive complexion of the Arabs, afford a proof that two thousand years
are not sufficient to change the color of the human race. The Nubians,
an African race, are pure negroes, as black as those of Senegal or
Congo, with flat noses, thick lips, and woolly hair, (Buffon, Hist.
Naturelle, tom. v. p. 117, 143, 144, 166, 219, edit. in 12mo., Paris,
1769.) The ancients beheld, without much attention, the extraordinary
phenomenon which has exercised the philosophers and theologians of
modern times]

[Footnote 153: Asseman. Bibliot. Orient. tom. i. p. 329.]

[Footnote 154: The Christianity of the Nubians (A.D. 1153) is attested
by the sheriff al Edrisi, falsely described under the name of the Nubian
geographer, (p. 18,) who represents them as a nation of Jacobites. The
rays of historical light that twinkle in the history of Ranaudot (p.
178, 220--224, 281--286, 405, 434, 451, 464) are all previous to this
aera. See the modern state in the Lettres Edifiantes (Recueil, iv.) and
Busching, (tom. ix. p. 152--139, par Berenger.)]

Christianity was more deeply rooted in the Abyssinian empire; and,
although the correspondence has been sometimes interrupted above seventy
or a hundred years, the mother-church of Alexandria retains her colony
in a state of perpetual pupilage. Seven bishops once composed the
Aethiopic synod: had their number amounted to ten, they might have
elected an independent primate; and one of their kings was ambitious of
promoting his brother to the ecclesiastical throne. But the event
was foreseen, the increase was denied: the episcopal office has been
gradually confined to the abuna, [155] the head and author of the
Abyssinian priesthood; the patriarch supplies each vacancy with an
Egyptian monk; and the character of a stranger appears more venerable in
the eyes of the people, less dangerous in those of the monarch. In the
sixth century, when the schism of Egypt was confirmed, the rival chiefs,
with their patrons, Justinian and Theodora, strove to outstrip each
other in the conquest of a remote and independent province. The
industry of the empress was again victorious, and the pious Theodora has
established in that sequestered church the faith and discipline of
the Jacobites. [156] Encompassed on all sides by the enemies of their
religion, the Aethiopians slept near a thousand years, forgetful of
the world, by whom they were forgotten. They were awakened by the
Portuguese, who, turning the southern promontory of Africa, appeared in
India and the Red Sea, as if they had descended through the air from a
distant planet. In the first moments of their interview, the subjects
of Rome and Alexandria observed the resemblance, rather than the
difference, of their faith; and each nation expected the most important
benefits from an alliance with their Christian brethren. In their lonely
situation, the Aethiopians had almost relapsed into the savage life.
Their vessels, which had traded to Ceylon, scarcely presumed to navigate
the rivers of Africa; the ruins of Axume were deserted, the nation was
scattered in villages, and the emperor, a pompous name, was content,
both in peace and war, with the immovable residence of a camp. Conscious
of their own indigence, the Abyssinians had formed the rational
project of importing the arts and ingenuity of Europe; [157] and their
ambassadors at Rome and Lisbon were instructed to solicit a colony of
smiths, carpenters, tilers, masons, printers, surgeons, and physicians,
for the use of their country. But the public danger soon called for the
instant and effectual aid of arms and soldiers, to defend an unwarlike
people from the Barbarians who ravaged the inland country and the Turks
and Arabs who advanced from the sea-coast in more formidable array.
Aethiopia was saved by four hundred and fifty Portuguese, who displayed
in the field the native valor of Europeans, and the artificial power of
the musket and cannon. In a moment of terror, the emperor had promised
to reconcile himself and his subjects to the Catholic faith; a Latin
patriarch represented the supremacy of the pope: [158] the empire,
enlarged in a tenfold proportion, was supposed to contain more gold than
the mines of America; and the wildest hopes of avarice and zeal were
built on the willing submission of the Christians of Africa.

[Footnote 155: The abuna is improperly dignified by the Latins with
the title of patriarch. The Abyssinians acknowledge only the four
patriarchs, and their chief is no more than a metropolitan or national
primate, (Ludolph. Hist. Aethiopic. et Comment. l. iii. c. 7.) The seven
bishops of Renaudot, (p. 511,) who existed A.D. 1131, are unknown to the
historian.]

[Footnote 156: I know not why Assemannus (Bibliot. Orient. tom. ii. p.
384) should call in question these probable missions of Theodora into
Nubia and Aethiopia. The slight notices of Abyssinia till the year 1500
are supplied by Renaudot (p. 336-341, 381, 382, 405, 443, &c., 452, 456,
463, 475, 480, 511, 525, 559--564) from the Coptic writers. The mind of
Ludolphus was a perfect blank.]

[Footnote 157: Ludolph. Hist. Aethiop. l. iv. c. 5. The most necessary
arts are now exercised by the Jews, and the foreign trade is in the
hands of the Armenians. What Gregory principally admired and envied was
the industry of Europe--artes et opificia.]

[Footnote 158: John Bermudez, whose relation, printed at Lisbon, 1569,
was translated into English by Purchas, (Pilgrims, l. vii. c. 7, p.
1149, &c.,) and from thence into French by La Croze, (Christianisme
d'Ethiopie, p. 92--265.) The piece is curious; but the author may be
suspected of deceiving Abyssinia, Rome, and Portugal. His title to the
rank of patriarch is dark and doubtful, (Ludolph. Comment. No. 101, p.
473.)]

But the vows which pain had extorted were forsworn on the return of
health. The Abyssinians still adhered with unshaken constancy to the
Monophysite faith; their languid belief was inflamed by the exercise
of dispute; they branded the Latins with the names of Arians and
Nestorians, and imputed the adoration of four gods to those who
separated the two natures of Christ. Fremona, a place of worship, or
rather of exile, was assigned to the Jesuit missionaries. Their skill
in the liberal and mechanic arts, their theological learning, and the
decency of their manners, inspired a barren esteem; but they were not
endowed with the gift of miracles, [159] and they vainly solicited a
reenforcement of European troops. The patience and dexterity of forty
years at length obtained a more favorable audience, and two emperors
of Abyssinia were persuaded that Rome could insure the temporal and
everlasting happiness of her votaries. The first of these royal converts
lost his crown and his life; and the rebel army was sanctified by the
abuna, who hurled an anathema at the apostate, and absolved his subjects
from their oath of fidelity. The fate of Zadenghel was revenged by the
courage and fortune of Susneus, who ascended the throne under the name
of Segued, and more vigorously prosecuted the pious enterprise of his
kinsman. After the amusement of some unequal combats between the Jesuits
and his illiterate priests, the emperor declared himself a proselyte
to the synod of Chalcedon, presuming that his clergy and people would
embrace without delay the religion of their prince. The liberty of
choice was succeeded by a law, which imposed, under pain of death, the
belief of the two natures of Christ: the Abyssinians were enjoined to
work and to play on the Sabbath; and Segued, in the face of Europe and
Africa, renounced his connection with the Alexandrian church. A Jesuit,
Alphonso Mendez, the Catholic patriarch of Aethiopia, accepted, in
the name of Urban VIII., the homage and abjuration of the penitent. "I
confess," said the emperor on his knees, "I confess that the pope is the
vicar of Christ, the successor of St. Peter, and the sovereign of the
world. To him I swear true obedience, and at his feet I offer my person
and kingdom." A similar oath was repeated by his son, his brother,
the clergy, the nobles, and even the ladies of the court: the Latin
patriarch was invested with honors and wealth; and his missionaries
erected their churches or citadels in the most convenient stations of
the empire. The Jesuits themselves deplore the fatal indiscretion of
their chief, who forgot the mildness of the gospel and the policy of
his order, to introduce with hasty violence the liturgy of Rome and
the inquisition of Portugal. He condemned the ancient practice of
circumcision, which health, rather than superstition, had first invented
in the climate of Aethiopia. [160] A new baptism, a new ordination, was
inflicted on the natives; and they trembled with horror when the most
holy of the dead were torn from their graves, when the most illustrious
of the living were excommunicated by a foreign priest. In the defense of
their religion and liberty, the Abyssinians rose in arms, with desperate
but unsuccessful zeal. Five rebellions were extinguished in the blood
of the insurgents: two abunas were slain in battle, whole legions were
slaughtered in the field, or suffocated in their caverns; and neither
merit, nor rank, nor sex, could save from an ignominious death the
enemies of Rome. But the victorious monarch was finally subdued by the
constancy of the nation, of his mother, of his son, and of his most
faithful friends. Segued listened to the voice of pity, of reason,
perhaps of fear: and his edict of liberty of conscience instantly
revealed the tyranny and weakness of the Jesuits. On the death of his
father, Basilides expelled the Latin patriarch, and restored to
the wishes of the nation the faith and the discipline of Egypt. The
Monophysite churches resounded with a song of triumph, "that the sheep
of Aethiopia were now delivered from the hyaenas of the West;" and the
gates of that solitary realm were forever shut against the arts, the
science, and the fanaticism of Europe. [161]

[Footnote 159: Religio Romana...nec precibus patrum nec miraculis ab
ipsis editis suffulciebatur, is the uncontradicted assurance of the
devout emperor Susneus to his patriarch Mendez, (Ludolph. Comment.
No. 126, p. 529;) and such assurances should be preciously kept, as an
antidote against any marvellous legends.]

[Footnote 160: I am aware how tender is the question of circumcision.
Yet I will affirm, 1. That the Aethiopians have a physical reason
for the circumcision of males, and even of females, (Recherches
Philosophiques sur les Americains, tom. ii.) 2. That it was practised
in Aethiopia long before the introduction of Judaism or Christianity,
(Herodot. l. ii. c. 104. Marsham, Canon. Chron. p. 72, 73.) "Infantes
circumcidunt ob consuetudinemn, non ob Judaismum," says Gregory the
Abyssinian priest, (apud Fabric. Lux Christiana, p. 720.) Yet in the
heat of dispute, the Portuguese were sometimes branded with the name of
uncircumcised, (La Croze, p. 90. Ludolph. Hist. and Comment. l. iii. c.
l.)]

[Footnote 161: The three Protestant historians, Ludolphus, (Hist.
Aethiopica, Francofurt. 1681; Commentarius, 1691; Relatio Nova, &c.,
1693, in folio,) Geddes, (Church History of Aethiopia, London, 1696, in
8vo..) and La Croze, (Hist. du Christianisme d'Ethiopie et d'Armenie,
La Haye, 1739, in 12mo.,) have drawn their principal materials from the
Jesuits, especially from the General History of Tellez, published in
Portuguese at Coimbra, 1660. We might be surprised at their frankness;
but their most flagitious vice, the spirit of persecution, was in their
eyes the most meritorious virtue. Ludolphus possessed some, though
a slight, advantage from the Aethiopic language, and the personal
conversation of Gregory, a free-spirited Abyssinian priest, whom
he invited from Rome to the court of Saxe-Gotha. See the Theologia
Aethiopica of Gregory, in (Fabric. Lux Evangelii, p. 716--734.) *
Note: The travels of Bruce, illustrated by those of Mr. Salt, and the
narrative of Nathaniel Pearce, have brought us again acquainted with
this remote region. Whatever may be their speculative opinions the
barbarous manners of the Ethiopians seem to be gaining more and more the
ascendency over the practice of Christianity.--M.]
