## Chapter XLV: State Of Italy Under The Lombards.--Part II.

The ambitious Rosamond aspired to reign in the name of her lover; the
city and palace of Verona were awed by her power; and a faithful band
of her native Gepidae was prepared to applaud the revenge, and to second
the wishes, of their sovereign. But the Lombard chiefs, who fled in the
first moments of consternation and disorder, had resumed their courage
and collected their powers; and the nation, instead of submitting to her
reign, demanded, with unanimous cries, that justice should be executed
on the guilty spouse and the murderers of their king. She sought a
refuge among the enemies of her country; and a criminal who deserved the
abhorrence of mankind was protected by the selfish policy of the exarch.
With her daughter, the heiress of the Lombard throne, her two lovers,
her trusty Gepidae, and the spoils of the palace of Verona, Rosamond
descended the Adige and the Po, and was transported by a Greek vessel to
the safe harbor of Ravenna. Longinus beheld with delight the charms and
the treasures of the widow of Alboin: her situation and her past conduct
might justify the most licentious proposals; and she readily listened to
the passion of a minister, who, even in the decline of the empire, was
respected as the equal of kings. The death of a jealous lover was an
easy and grateful sacrifice; and, as Helmichis issued from the bath, he
received the deadly potion from the hand of his mistress. The taste of
the liquor, its speedy operation, and his experience of the character of
Rosamond, convinced him that he was poisoned: he pointed his dagger to
her breast, compelled her to drain the remainder of the cup, and expired
in a few minutes, with the consolation that she could not survive to
enjoy the fruits of her wickedness. The daughter of Alboin and
Rosamond, with the richest spoils of the Lombards, was embarked for
Constantinople: the surprising strength of Peredeus amused and terrified
the Imperial court: [2111] his blindness and revenge exhibited an
imperfect copy of the adventures of Samson. By the free suffrage of the
nation, in the assembly of Pavia, Clepho, one of their noblest chiefs,
was elected as the successor of Alboin. Before the end of eighteen
months, the throne was polluted by a second murder: Clepho was stabbed
by the hand of a domestic; the regal office was suspended above ten
years during the minority of his son Autharis; and Italy was divided and
oppressed by a ducal aristocracy of thirty tyrants. [22]

[Footnote 2111: He killed a lion. His eyes were put out by the timid
Justin. Peredeus requesting an interview, Justin substituted two
patricians, whom the blinded Barbarian stabbed to the heart with two
concealed daggers. See Le Beau, vol. x. p. 99.--M.]

[Footnote 22: See the history of Paul, l. ii. c. 28--32. I have borrowed
some interesting circumstances from the Liber Pontificalis of Agnellus,
in Script. Rer. Ital. tom. ii. p. 124. Of all chronological guides,
Muratori is the safest.]

When the nephew of Justinian ascended the throne, he proclaimed a new
aera of happiness and glory. The annals of the second Justin [23] are
marked with disgrace abroad and misery at home. In the West, the Roman
empire was afflicted by the loss of Italy, the desolation of Africa, and
the conquests of the Persians. Injustice prevailed both in the capital
and the provinces: the rich trembled for their property, the poor for
their safety, the ordinary magistrates were ignorant or venal, the
occasional remedies appear to have been arbitrary and violent, and the
complaints of the people could no longer be silenced by the splendid
names of a legislator and a conqueror. The opinion which imputes to
the prince all the calamities of his times may be countenanced by the
historian as a serious truth or a salutary prejudice. Yet a candid
suspicion will arise, that the sentiments of Justin were pure and
benevolent, and that he might have filled his station without reproach,
if the faculties of his mind had not been impaired by disease, which
deprived the emperor of the use of his feet, and confined him to the
palace, a stranger to the complaints of the people and the vices of the
government. The tardy knowledge of his own impotence determined him
to lay down the weight of the diadem; and, in the choice of a worthy
substitute, he showed some symptoms of a discerning and even magnanimous
spirit. The only son of Justin and Sophia died in his infancy; their
daughter Arabia was the wife of Baduarius, [24] superintendent of the
palace, and afterwards commander of the Italian armies, who vainly
aspired to confirm the rights of marriage by those of adoption. While
the empire appeared an object of desire, Justin was accustomed to behold
with jealousy and hatred his brothers and cousins, the rivals of his
hopes; nor could he depend on the gratitude of those who would accept
the purple as a restitution, rather than a gift. Of these competitors,
one had been removed by exile, and afterwards by death; and the emperor
himself had inflicted such cruel insults on another, that he must either
dread his resentment or despise his patience. This domestic animosity
was refined into a generous resolution of seeking a successor, not
in his family, but in the republic; and the artful Sophia recommended
Tiberius, [25] his faithful captain of the guards, whose virtues and
fortune the emperor might cherish as the fruit of his judicious choice.
The ceremony of his elevation to the rank of Caesar, or Augustus, was
performed in the portico of the palace, in the presence of the patriarch
and the senate. Justin collected the remaining strength of his mind and
body; but the popular belief that his speech was inspired by the Deity
betrays a very humble opinion both of the man and of the times. [26]
"You behold," said the emperor, "the ensigns of supreme power. You are
about to receive them, not from my hand, but from the hand of God. Honor
them, and from them you will derive honor. Respect the empress your
mother: you are now her son; before, you were her servant. Delight not
in blood; abstain from revenge; avoid those actions by which I have
incurred the public hatred; and consult the experience, rather than the
example, of your predecessor. As a man, I have sinned; as a sinner, even
in this life, I have been severely punished: but these servants, (and we
pointed to his ministers,) who have abused my confidence, and inflamed
my passions, will appear with me before the tribunal of Christ. I have
been dazzled by the splendor of the diadem: be thou wise and modest;
remember what you have been, remember what you are. You see around
us your slaves, and your children: with the authority, assume the
tenderness, of a parent. Love your people like yourself; cultivate the
affections, maintain the discipline, of the army; protect the fortunes
of the rich, relieve the necessities of the poor." [27] The assembly, in
silence and in tears, applauded the counsels, and sympathized with the
repentance, of their prince the patriarch rehearsed the prayers of the
church; Tiberius received the diadem on his knees; and Justin, who in
his abdication appeared most worthy to reign, addressed the new monarch
in the following words: "If you consent, I live; if you command, I die:
may the God of heaven and earth infuse into your heart whatever I have
neglected or forgotten." The four last years of the emperor Justin were
passed in tranquil obscurity: his conscience was no longer tormented by
the remembrance of those duties which he was incapable of discharging;
and his choice was justified by the filial reverence and gratitude of
Tiberius.

as early as the ninth century; and, if their descent be admitted, no
kings in Europe can produce a pedigree so ancient and illustrious.

[Footnote 25: The praise bestowed on princes before their elevation is
the purest and most weighty. Corippus has celebrated Tiberius at the
time of the accession of Justin, (l. i. 212--222.) Yet even a captain of
the guards might attract the flattery of an African exile.]

[Footnote 26: Evagrius (l. v. c. 13) has added the reproach to his
ministers He applies this speech to the ceremony when Tiberius was
invested with the rank of Caesar. The loose expression, rather than
the positive error, of Theophanes, &c., has delayed it to his Augustan
investitura immediately before the death of Justin.]

[Footnote 27: Theophylact Simocatta (l. iii. c. 11) declares that he
shall give to posterity the speech of Justin as it was pronounced,
without attempting to correct the imperfections of language or rhetoric.
Perhaps the vain sophist would have been incapable of producing such
sentiments.]

Among the virtues of Tiberius, [28] his beauty (he was one of the
tallest and most comely of the Romans) might introduce him to the
favor of Sophia; and the widow of Justin was persuaded, that she should
preserve her station and influence under the reign of a second and more
youthful husband. But, if the ambitious candidate had been tempted
to flatter and dissemble, it was no longer in his power to fulfil
her expectations, or his own promise. The factions of the hippodrome
demanded, with some impatience, the name of their new empress: both the
people and Sophia were astonished by the proclamation of Anastasia,
the secret, though lawful, wife of the emperor Tiberius. Whatever could
alleviate the disappointment of Sophia, Imperial honors, a stately
palace, a numerous household, was liberally bestowed by the piety of her
adopted son; on solemn occasions he attended and consulted the widow
of his benefactor; but her ambition disdained the vain semblance of
royalty, and the respectful appellation of mother served to exasperate,
rather than appease, the rage of an injured woman. While she accepted,
and repaid with a courtly smile, the fair expressions of regard and
confidence, a secret alliance was concluded between the dowager empress
and her ancient enemies; and Justinian, the son of Germanus, was
employed as the instrument of her revenge. The pride of the reigning
house supported, with reluctance, the dominion of a stranger: the youth
was deservedly popular; his name, after the death of Justin, had been
mentioned by a tumultuous faction; and his own submissive offer of his
head with a treasure of sixty thousand pounds, might be interpreted as
an evidence of guilt, or at least of fear. Justinian received a free
pardon, and the command of the eastern army. The Persian monarch fled
before his arms; and the acclamations which accompanied his triumph
declared him worthy of the purple. His artful patroness had chosen
the month of the vintage, while the emperor, in a rural solitude, was
permitted to enjoy the pleasures of a subject. On the first intelligence
of her designs, he returned to Constantinople, and the conspiracy was
suppressed by his presence and firmness. From the pomp and honors which
she had abused, Sophia was reduced to a modest allowance: Tiberius
dismissed her train, intercepted her correspondence, and committed to a
faithful guard the custody of her person. But the services of Justinian
were not considered by that excellent prince as an aggravation of
his offences: after a mild reproof, his treason and ingratitude were
forgiven; and it was commonly believed, that the emperor entertained
some thoughts of contracting a double alliance with the rival of his
throne. The voice of an angel (such a fable was propagated) might reveal
to the emperor, that he should always triumph over his domestic
foes; but Tiberius derived a firmer assurance from the innocence and
generosity of his own mind.

With the odious name of Tiberius, he assumed the more popular
appellation of Constantine, and imitated the purer virtues of the
Antonines. After recording the vice or folly of so many Roman princes,
it is pleasing to repose, for a moment, on a character conspicuous
by the qualities of humanity, justice, temperance, and fortitude; to
contemplate a sovereign affable in his palace, pious in the church,
impartial on the seat of judgment, and victorious, at least by his
generals, in the Persian war. The most glorious trophy of his victory
consisted in a multitude of captives, whom Tiberius entertained,
redeemed, and dismissed to their native homes with the charitable spirit
of a Christian hero. The merit or misfortunes of his own subjects had a
dearer claim to his beneficence, and he measured his bounty not so
much by their expectations as by his own dignity. This maxim, however
dangerous in a trustee of the public wealth, was balanced by a principle
of humanity and justice, which taught him to abhor, as of the basest
alloy, the gold that was extracted from the tears of the people. For
their relief, as often as they had suffered by natural or hostile
calamities, he was impatient to remit the arrears of the past, or the
demands of future taxes: he sternly rejected the servile offerings of
his ministers, which were compensated by tenfold oppression; and the
wise and equitable laws of Tiberius excited the praise and regret
of succeeding times. Constantinople believed that the emperor had
discovered a treasure: but his genuine treasure consisted in the
practice of liberal economy, and the contempt of all vain and
superfluous expense. The Romans of the East would have been happy, if
the best gift of Heaven, a patriot king, had been confirmed as a proper
and permanent blessing. But in less than four years after the death of
Justin, his worthy successor sunk into a mortal disease, which left him
only sufficient time to restore the diadem, according to the tenure
by which he held it, to the most deserving of his fellow-citizens.
He selected Maurice from the crowd, a judgment more precious than the
purple itself: the patriarch and senate were summoned to the bed of
the dying prince: he bestowed his daughter and the empire; and his last
advice was solemnly delivered by the voice of the quaestor. Tiberius
expressed his hope that the virtues of his son and successor would erect
the noblest mausoleum to his memory. His memory was embalmed by the
public affliction; but the most sincere grief evaporates in the tumult
of a new reign, and the eyes and acclamations of mankind were speedily
directed to the rising sun. The emperor Maurice derived his origin from
ancient Rome; [29] but his immediate parents were settled at Arabissus
in Cappadocia, and their singular felicity preserved them alive to
behold and partake the fortune of their august son. The youth of Maurice
was spent in the profession of arms: Tiberius promoted him to the
command of a new and favorite legion of twelve thousand confederates;
his valor and conduct were signalized in the Persian war; and
he returned to Constantinople to accept, as his just reward, the
inheritance of the empire. Maurice ascended the throne at the mature age
of forty-three years; and he reigned above twenty years over the East
and over himself; [30] expelling from his mind the wild democracy
of passions, and establishing (according to the quaint expression of
Evagrius) a perfect aristocracy of reason and virtue. Some suspicion
will degrade the testimony of a subject, though he protests that his
secret praise should never reach the ear of his sovereign, [31] and some
failings seem to place the character of Maurice below the purer merit
of his predecessor. His cold and reserved demeanor might be imputed
to arrogance; his justice was not always exempt from cruelty, nor his
clemency from weakness; and his rigid economy too often exposed him to
the reproach of avarice. But the rational wishes of an absolute monarch
must tend to the happiness of his people. Maurice was endowed with
sense and courage to promote that happiness, and his administration was
directed by the principles and example of Tiberius. The pusillanimity of
the Greeks had introduced so complete a separation between the offices
of king and of general, that a private soldier, who had deserved and
obtained the purple, seldom or never appeared at the head of his armies.
Yet the emperor Maurice enjoyed the glory of restoring the Persian
monarch to his throne; his lieutenants waged a doubtful war against the
Avars of the Danube; and he cast an eye of pity, of ineffectual pity, on
the abject and distressful state of his Italian provinces.

[Footnote 29: It is therefore singular enough that Paul (l. iii. c. 15)
should distinguish him as the first Greek emperor--primus ex Graecorum
genere in Imperio constitutus. His immediate predecessors had in deed
been born in the Latin provinces of Europe: and a various reading, in
Graecorum Imperio, would apply the expression to the empire rather than
the prince.]

[Footnote 30: Consult, for the character and reign of Maurice, the fifth
and sixth books of Evagrius, particularly l. vi. c. l; the eight books
of his prolix and florid history by Theophylact Simocatta; Theophanes,
p. 213, &c.; Zonaras, tom. ii. l. xiv. p. 73; Cedrenus, p. 394.]

[Footnote 31: Evagrius composed his history in the twelfth year of
Maurice; and he had been so wisely indiscreet that the emperor know and
rewarded his favorable opinion, (l. vi. c. 24.)]

From Italy the emperors were incessantly tormented by tales of misery
and demands of succor, which extorted the humiliating confession of
their own weakness. The expiring dignity of Rome was only marked by the
freedom and energy of her complaints: "If you are incapable," she said,
"of delivering us from the sword of the Lombards, save us at least from
the calamity of famine." Tiberius forgave the reproach, and relieved the
distress: a supply of corn was transported from Egypt to the Tyber; and
the Roman people, invoking the name, not of Camillus, but of St. Peter
repulsed the Barbarians from their walls. But the relief was accidental,
the danger was perpetual and pressing; and the clergy and senate,
collecting the remains of their ancient opulence, a sum of three
thousand pounds of gold, despatched the patrician Pamphronius to lay
their gifts and their complaints at the foot of the Byzantine throne.
The attention of the court, and the forces of the East, were diverted by
the Persian war: but the justice of Tiberius applied the subsidy to
the defence of the city; and he dismissed the patrician with his best
advice, either to bribe the Lombard chiefs, or to purchase the aid of
the kings of France. Notwithstanding this weak invention, Italy was
still afflicted, Rome was again besieged, and the suburb of Classe, only
three miles from Ravenna, was pillaged and occupied by the troops of a
simple duke of Spoleto. Maurice gave audience to a second deputation
of priests and senators: the duties and the menaces of religion were
forcibly urged in the letters of the Roman pontiff; and his nuncio,
the deacon Gregory, was alike qualified to solicit the powers either of
heaven or of the earth.

The emperor adopted, with stronger effect, the measures of his
predecessor: some formidable chiefs were persuaded to embrace the
friendship of the Romans; and one of them, a mild and faithful
Barbarian, lived and died in the service of the exarchs: the passes of
the Alps were delivered to the Franks; and the pope encouraged them
to violate, without scruple, their oaths and engagements to the
misbelievers. Childebert, the great-grandson of Clovis, was persuaded
to invade Italy by the payment of fifty thousand pieces; but, as he had
viewed with delight some Byzantine coin of the weight of one pound of
gold, the king of Austrasia might stipulate, that the gift should be
rendered more worthy of his acceptance, by a proper mixture of these
respectable medals. The dukes of the Lombards had provoked by frequent
inroads their powerful neighbors of Gaul. As soon as they were
apprehensive of a just retaliation, they renounced their feeble and
disorderly independence: the advantages of real government, union,
secrecy, and vigor, were unanimously confessed; and Autharis, the son of
Clepho, had already attained the strength and reputation of a warrior.
Under the standard of their new king, the conquerors of Italy withstood
three successive invasions, one of which was led by Childebert himself,
the last of the Merovingian race who descended from the Alps. The first
expedition was defeated by the jealous animosity of the Franks and
Alemanni. In the second they were vanquished in a bloody battle, with
more loss and dishonor than they had sustained since the foundation of
their monarchy. Impatient for revenge, they returned a third time with
accumulated force, and Autharis yielded to the fury of the torrent.
The troops and treasures of the Lombards were distributed in the walled
towns between the Alps and the Apennine. A nation, less sensible of
danger than of fatigue and delay, soon murmured against the folly of
their twenty commanders; and the hot vapors of an Italian sun infected
with disease those tramontane bodies which had already suffered the
vicissitudes of intemperance and famine. The powers that were inadequate
to the conquest, were more than sufficient for the desolation, of the
country; nor could the trembling natives distinguish between their
enemies and their deliverers. If the junction of the Merovingian and
Imperial forces had been effected in the neighborhood of Milan, perhaps
they might have subverted the throne of the Lombards; but the Franks
expected six days the signal of a flaming village, and the arms of the
Greeks were idly employed in the reduction of Modena and Parma, which
were torn from them after the retreat of their transalpine allies. The
victorious Autharis asserted his claim to the dominion of Italy. At the
foot of the Rhaetian Alps, he subdued the resistance, and rifled the
hidden treasures, of a sequestered island in the Lake of Comum. At the
extreme point of the Calabria, he touched with his spear a column on the
sea-shore of Rhegium, [32] proclaiming that ancient landmark to stand
the immovable boundary of his kingdom. [33]

[Footnote 32: The Columna Rhegina, in the narrowest part of the Faro of
Messina, one hundred stadia from Rhegium itself, is frequently mentioned
in ancient geography. Cluver. Ital. Antiq. tom. ii. p. 1295. Lucas

[Footnote 33: The Greek historians afford some faint hints of the wars
of Italy (Menander, in Excerpt. Legat. p. 124, 126. Theophylact, l. iii.
c. 4.) The Latins are more satisfactory; and especially Paul Warnefrid,
(l iii. c. 13--34,) who had read the more ancient histories of Secundus
and Gregory of Tours. Baronius produces some letters of the popes, &c.;
and the times are measured by the accurate scale of Pagi and Muratori.]

During a period of two hundred years, Italy was unequally divided
between the kingdom of the Lombards and the exarchate of Ravenna.
The offices and professions, which the jealousy of Constantine had
separated, were united by the indulgence of Justinian; and eighteen
successive exarchs were invested, in the decline of the empire, with the
full remains of civil, of military, and even of ecclesiastical, power.
Their immediate jurisdiction, which was afterwards consecrated as the
patrimony of St. Peter, extended over the modern Romagna, the marshes or
valleys of Ferrara and Commachio, [34] five maritime cities from Rimini
to Ancona, and a second inland Pentapolis, between the Adriatic coast
and the hills of the Apennine. Three subordinate provinces, of Rome,
of Venice, and of Naples, which were divided by hostile lands from the
palace of Ravenna, acknowledged, both in peace and war, the supremacy
of the exarch. The duchy of Rome appears to have included the Tuscan,
Sabine, and Latin conquests, of the first four hundred years of the
city, and the limits may be distinctly traced along the coast, from
Civita Vecchia to Terracina, and with the course of the Tyber from
Ameria and Narni to the port of Ostia. The numerous islands from
Grado to Chiozza composed the infant dominion of Venice: but the more
accessible towns on the Continent were overthrown by the Lombards, who
beheld with impotent fury a new capital rising from the waves. The power
of the dukes of Naples was circumscribed by the bay and the adjacent
isles, by the hostile territory of Capua, and by the Roman colony
of Amalphi, [35] whose industrious citizens, by the invention of the
mariner's compass, have unveiled the face of the globe. The three
islands of Sardinia, Corsica, and Sicily, still adhered to the empire;
and the acquisition of the farther Calabria removed the landmark of
Autharis from the shore of Rhegium to the Isthmus of Consentia. In
Sardinia, the savage mountaineers preserved the liberty and religion of
their ancestors; and the husbandmen of Sicily were chained to their
rich and cultivated soil. Rome was oppressed by the iron sceptre of the
exarchs, and a Greek, perhaps a eunuch, insulted with impunity the ruins
of the Capitol. But Naples soon acquired the privilege of electing her
own dukes: [36] the independence of Amalphi was the fruit of commerce;
and the voluntary attachment of Venice was finally ennobled by an equal
alliance with the Eastern empire. On the map of Italy, the measure of
the exarchate occupies a very inadequate space, but it included an ample
proportion of wealth, industry, and population. The most faithful and
valuable subjects escaped from the Barbarian yoke; and the banners of
Pavia and Verona, of Milan and Padua, were displayed in their respective
quarters by the new inhabitants of Ravenna. The remainder of Italy was
possessed by the Lombards; and from Pavia, the royal seat, their
kingdom was extended to the east, the north, and the west, as far as the
confines of the Avars, the Bavarians, and the Franks of Austrasia and
Burgundy. In the language of modern geography, it is now represented by
the Terra Firma of the Venetian republic, Tyrol, the Milanese, Piedmont,
the coast of Genoa, Mantua, Parma, and Modena, the grand duchy of
Tuscany, and a large portion of the ecclesiastical state from Perugia
to the Adriatic. The dukes, and at length the princes, of Beneventum,
survived the monarchy, and propagated the name of the Lombards. From
Capua to Tarentum, they reigned near five hundred years over the
greatest part of the present kingdom of Naples. [37]

[Footnote 34: The papal advocates, Zacagni and Fontanini, might justly
claim the valley or morass of Commachio as a part of the exarchate.
But the ambition of including Modena, Reggio, Parma, and Placentia,
has darkened a geographical question somewhat doubtful and obscure
Even Muratori, as the servant of the house of Este, is not free from
partiality and prejudice.]

1--42, ad calcem Hist. Pandect. Florent.]

[Footnote 36: Gregor. Magn. l. iii. epist. 23, 25.]

[Footnote 37: I have described the state of Italy from the excellent
Dissertation of Beretti. Giannone (Istoria Civile, tom. i. p. 374--387)
has followed the learned Camillo Pellegrini in the geography of the
kingdom of Naples. After the loss of the true Calabria, the vanity of
the Greeks substituted that name instead of the more ignoble appellation
of Bruttium; and the change appears to have taken place before the time
of Charlemagne, (Eginard, p. 75.)]

In comparing the proportion of the victorious and the vanquished
people, the change of language will afford the most probably inference.
According to this standard, it will appear, that the Lombards of Italy,
and the Visigoths of Spain, were less numerous than the Franks or
Burgundians; and the conquerors of Gaul must yield, in their turn, to
the multitude of Saxons and Angles who almost eradicated the idioms of
Britain. The modern Italian has been insensibly formed by the mixture
of nations: the awkwardness of the Barbarians in the nice management
of declensions and conjugations reduced them to the use of articles
and auxiliary verbs; and many new ideas have been expressed by Teutonic
appellations. Yet the principal stock of technical and familiar words
is found to be of Latin derivation; [38] and, if we were sufficiently
conversant with the obsolete, the rustic, and the municipal dialects
of ancient Italy, we should trace the origin of many terms which might,
perhaps, be rejected by the classic purity of Rome. A numerous army
constitutes but a small nation, and the powers of the Lombards were
soon diminished by the retreat of twenty thousand Saxons, who scorned
a dependent situation, and returned, after many bold and perilous
adventures, to their native country. [39] The camp of Alboin was
of formidable extent, but the extent of a camp would be easily
circumscribed within the limits of a city; and its martial in habitants
must be thinly scattered over the face of a large country. When Alboin
descended from the Alps, he invested his nephew, the first duke of
Friuli, with the command of the province and the people: but the prudent
Gisulf would have declined the dangerous office, unless he had been
permitted to choose, among the nobles of the Lombards, a sufficient
number of families [40] to form a perpetual colony of soldiers and
subjects. In the progress of conquest, the same option could not be
granted to the dukes of Brescia or Bergamo, or Pavia or Turin, of
Spoleto or Beneventum; but each of these, and each of their colleagues,
settled in his appointed district with a band of followers who resorted
to his standard in war and his tribunal in peace. Their attachment was
free and honorable: resigning the gifts and benefits which they had
accepted, they might emigrate with their families into the jurisdiction
of another duke; but their absence from the kingdom was punished with
death, as a crime of military desertion. [41] The posterity of the first
conquerors struck a deeper root into the soil, which, by every motive
of interest and honor, they were bound to defend. A Lombard was born the
soldier of his king and his duke; and the civil assemblies of the nation
displayed the banners, and assumed the appellation, of a regular army.
Of this army, the pay and the rewards were drawn from the conquered
provinces; and the distribution, which was not effected till after the
death of Alboin, is disgraced by the foul marks of injustice and rapine.
Many of the most wealthy Italians were slain or banished; the remainder
were divided among the strangers, and a tributary obligation was imposed
(under the name of hospitality) of paying to the Lombards a third
part of the fruits of the earth. Within less than seventy years, this
artificial system was abolished by a more simple and solid tenure. [42]
Either the Roman landlord was expelled by his strong and insolent guest,
or the annual payment, a third of the produce, was exchanged by a more
equitable transaction for an adequate proportion of landed property.
Under these foreign masters, the business of agriculture, in the
cultivation of corn, wines, and olives, was exercised with degenerate
skill and industry by the labor of the slaves and natives. But the
occupations of a pastoral life were more pleasing to the idleness of the
Barbarian. In the rich meadows of Venetia, they restored and improved
the breed of horses, for which that province had once been illustrious;
[43] and the Italians beheld with astonishment a foreign race of oxen
or buffaloes. [44] The depopulation of Lombardy, and the increase of
forests, afforded an ample range for the pleasures of the chase. [45]
That marvellous art which teaches the birds of the air to acknowledge
the voice, and execute the commands, of their master, had been unknown
to the ingenuity of the Greeks and Romans. [46] Scandinavia and Scythia
produce the boldest and most tractable falcons: [47] they were tamed
and educated by the roving inhabitants, always on horseback and in the
field. This favorite amusement of our ancestors was introduced by the
Barbarians into the Roman provinces; and the laws of Italy esteemed the
sword and the hawk as of equal dignity and importance in the hands of a
noble Lombard. [48]

[Footnote 38: Maffei (Verona Illustrata, part i. p. 310--321) and
Muratori (Antichita Italiane, tom. ii. Dissertazione xxxii. xxxiii.
p. 71--365) have asserted the native claims of the Italian idiom; the
former with enthusiasm, the latter with discretion; both with learning,
ingenuity, and truth. Note: Compare the admirable sketch of the
degeneracy of the Latin language and the formation of the Italian in
Hallam, Middle Ages, vol. iii. p. 317 329.--M.]

[Footnote 39: Paul, de Gest. Langobard. l. iii. c. 5, 6, 7.]

[Footnote 40: Paul, l. ii. c. 9. He calls these families or generations
by the Teutonic name of Faras, which is likewise used in the Lombard
laws. The humble deacon was not insensible of the nobility of his own
race. See l. iv. c. 39.]

[Footnote 41: Compare No. 3 and 177 of the Laws of Rotharis.]

[Footnote 42: Paul, l. ii. c. 31, 32, l. iii. c. 16. The Laws of
Rotharis, promulgated A.D. 643, do not contain the smallest vestige of
this payment of thirds; but they preserve many curious circumstances of
the state of Italy and the manners of the Lombards.]

[Footnote 43: The studs of Dionysius of Syracuse, and his frequent
victories in the Olympic games, had diffused among the Greeks the fame
of the Venetian horses; but the breed was extinct in the time of Strabo,
(l. v. p. 325.) Gisulf obtained from his uncle generosarum equarum
greges. Paul, l. ii. c. 9. The Lombards afterwards introduced caballi
sylvatici--wild horses. Paul, l. iv. c. 11.]

[Footnote 44: Tunc (A.D. 596) primum, bubali in Italiam delati Italiae
populis miracula fuere, (Paul Warnefrid, l. iv. c. 11.) The buffaloes,
whose native climate appears to be Africa and India, are unknown
to Europe, except in Italy, where they are numerous and useful. The
ancients were ignorant of these animals, unless Aristotle (Hist. Anim.
l. ii. c. 1, p. 58, Paris, 1783) has described them as the wild oxen of
Arachosia. See Buffon, Hist. Naturelle, tom. xi. and Supplement, tom.
vi. Hist. Generale des Voyages, tom. i. p. 7, 481, ii. 105, iii. 291,
iv. 234, 461, v. 193, vi. 491, viii. 400, x. 666. Pennant's Quadrupedes,
p. 24. Dictionnaire d'Hist. Naturelle, par Valmont de Bomare, tom.
ii. p. 74. Yet I must not conceal the suspicion that Paul, by a vulgar
error, may have applied the name of bubalus to the aurochs, or wild
bull, of ancient Germany.]

[Footnote 45: Consult the xxist Dissertation of Muratori.]

[Footnote 46: Their ignorance is proved by the silence even of those
who professedly treat of the arts of hunting and the history of animals.
Aristotle, (Hist. Animal. l. ix. c. 36, tom. i. p. 586, and the Notes of
his last editor, M. Camus, tom. ii. p. 314,) Pliny, (Hist. Natur. l.
x. c. 10,) Aelian (de Natur. Animal. l. ii. c. 42,) and perhaps Homer,
(Odyss. xxii. 302-306,) describe with astonishment a tacit league and
common chase between the hawks and the Thracian fowlers.]

[Footnote 47: Particularly the gerfaut, or gyrfalcon, of the size of
a small eagle. See the animated description of M. de Buffon, Hist.
Naturelle, tom. xvi. p. 239, &c.]

[Footnote 48: Script. Rerum Italicarum, tom. i. part ii. p. 129. This is
the xvith law of the emperor Lewis the Pious. His father Charlemagne had
falconers in his household as well as huntsmen, (Memoires sur l'ancienne
Chevalerie, par M. de St. Palaye, tom. iii. p. 175.) I observe in the
laws of Rotharis a more early mention of the art of hawking, (No.
322;) and in Gaul, in the fifth century, it is celebrated by Sidonius
Apollinaris among the talents of Avitus, (202--207.) * Note: See
Beckman, Hist. of Inventions, vol. i. p. 319--M.]
