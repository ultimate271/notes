## Chapter L: Description Of Arabia And Its Inhabitants.--Part VI.

The choice of Jerusalem for the first kebla of prayer discovers the
early propensity of Mahomet in favor of the Jews; and happy would it
have been for their temporal interest, had they recognized, in the
Arabian prophet, the hope of Israel and the promised Messiah. Their
obstinacy converted his friendship into implacable hatred, with which he
pursued that unfortunate people to the last moment of his life; and in
the double character of an apostle and a conqueror, his persecution was
extended to both worlds. [135] The Kainoka dwelt at Medina under the
protection of the city; he seized the occasion of an accidental tumult,
and summoned them to embrace his religion, or contend with him in
battle. "Alas!" replied the trembling Jews, "we are ignorant of the use
of arms, but we persevere in the faith and worship of our fathers; why
wilt thou reduce us to the necessity of a just defence?" The unequal
conflict was terminated in fifteen days; and it was with extreme
reluctance that Mahomet yielded to the importunity of his allies, and
consented to spare the lives of the captives. But their riches were
confiscated, their arms became more effectual in the hands of the
Mussulmans; and a wretched colony of seven hundred exiles was driven,
with their wives and children, to implore a refuge on the confines
of Syria. The Nadhirites were more guilty, since they conspired, in
a friendly interview, to assassinate the prophet. He besieged their
castle, three miles from Medina; but their resolute defence obtained an
honorable capitulation; and the garrison, sounding their trumpets and
beating their drums, was permitted to depart with the honors of war. The
Jews had excited and joined the war of the Koreish: no sooner had the
nations retired from the ditch, than Mahomet, without laying aside his
armor, marched on the same day to extirpate the hostile race of the
children of Koraidha. After a resistance of twenty-five days, they
surrendered at discretion. They trusted to the intercession of their old
allies of Medina; they could not be ignorant that fanaticism obliterates
the feelings of humanity. A venerable elder, to whose judgment they
appealed, pronounced the sentence of their death; seven hundred Jews
were dragged in chains to the market-place of the city; they descended
alive into the grave prepared for their execution and burial; and the
apostle beheld with an inflexible eye the slaughter of his helpless
enemies. Their sheep and camels were inherited by the Mussulmans: three
hundred cuirasses, five hundred piles, a thousand lances, composed the
most useful portion of the spoil. Six days' journey to the north-east
of Medina, the ancient and wealthy town of Chaibar was the seat of the
Jewish power in Arabia: the territory, a fertile spot in the desert,
was covered with plantations and cattle, and protected by eight castles,
some of which were esteemed of impregnable strength. The forces of
Mahomet consisted of two hundred horse and fourteen hundred foot: in
the succession of eight regular and painful sieges they were exposed to
danger, and fatigue, and hunger; and the most undaunted chiefs despaired
of the event. The apostle revived their faith and courage by the example
of Ali, on whom he bestowed the surname of the Lion of God: perhaps we
may believe that a Hebrew champion of gigantic stature was cloven to the
chest by his irresistible cimeter; but we cannot praise the modesty of
romance, which represents him as tearing from its hinges the gate of
a fortress and wielding the ponderous buckler in his left hand. [136]
After the reduction of the castles, the town of Chaibar submitted to the
yoke. The chief of the tribe was tortured, in the presence of Mahomet,
to force a confession of his hidden treasure: the industry of the
shepherds and husbandmen was rewarded with a precarious toleration: they
were permitted, so long as it should please the conqueror, to improve
their patrimony, in equal shares, for his emolument and their own. Under
the reign of Omar, the Jews of Chaibar were transported to Syria; and
the caliph alleged the injunction of his dying master; that one and the
true religion should be professed in his native land of Arabia. [137]

[Footnote 135: The wars of Mahomet against the Jewish tribes of Kainoka,
the Nadhirites, Koraidha, and Chaibar, are related by Abulfeda (p. 61,
71, 77, 87, &c.) and Gagnier, (tom. ii. p. 61-65, 107-112, 139-148,
268-294.)]

[Footnote 136: Abu Rafe, the servant of Mahomet, is said to affirm that
he himself, and seven other men, afterwards tried, without success, to
move the same gate from the ground, (Abulfeda, p. 90.) Abu Rafe was an
eye-witness, but who will be witness for Abu Rafe?]

[Footnote 137: The banishment of the Jews is attested by Elmacin (Hist.
Saracen, p. 9) and the great Al Zabari, (Gagnier, tom. ii. p. 285.)
Yet Niebuhr (Description de l'Arabie, p. 324) believes that the Jewish
religion, and Karaite sect, are still professed by the tribe of Chaibar;
and that, in the plunder of the caravans, the disciples of Moses are the
confederates of those of Mahomet.]

Five times each day the eyes of Mahomet were turned towards Mecca, [138]
and he was urged by the most sacred and powerful motives to revisit, as
a conqueror, the city and the temple from whence he had been driven as
an exile. The Caaba was present to his waking and sleeping fancy: an
idle dream was translated into vision and prophecy; he unfurled the holy
banner; and a rash promise of success too hastily dropped from the lips
of the apostle. His march from Medina to Mecca displayed the peaceful
and solemn pomp of a pilgrimage: seventy camels, chosen and bedecked for
sacrifice, preceded the van; the sacred territory was respected; and
the captives were dismissed without ransom to proclaim his clemency and
devotion. But no sooner did Mahomet descend into the plain, within
a day's journey of the city, than he exclaimed, "They have clothed
themselves with the skins of tigers:" the numbers and resolution of the
Koreish opposed his progress; and the roving Arabs of the desert might
desert or betray a leader whom they had followed for the hopes of spoil.
The intrepid fanatic sunk into a cool and cautious politician: he waived
in the treaty his title of apostle of God; concluded with the Koreish
and their allies a truce of ten years; engaged to restore the fugitives
of Mecca who should embrace his religion; and stipulated only, for the
ensuing year, the humble privilege of entering the city as a friend,
and of remaining three days to accomplish the rites of the pilgrimage.
A cloud of shame and sorrow hung on the retreat of the Mussulmans, and
their disappointment might justly accuse the failure of a prophet who
had so often appealed to the evidence of success. The faith and hope of
the pilgrims were rekindled by the prospect of Mecca: their swords
were sheathed; [1381] seven times in the footsteps of the apostle
they encompassed the Caaba: the Koreish had retired to the hills, and
Mahomet, after the customary sacrifice, evacuated the city on the fourth
day. The people was edified by his devotion; the hostile chiefs were
awed, or divided, or seduced; and both Kaled and Amrou, the future
conquerors of Syria and Egypt, most seasonably deserted the sinking
cause of idolatry. The power of Mahomet was increased by the submission
of the Arabian tribes; ten thousand soldiers were assembled for the
conquest of Mecca; and the idolaters, the weaker party, were easily
convicted of violating the truce. Enthusiasm and discipline impelled
the march, and preserved the secret till the blaze of ten thousand fires
proclaimed to the astonished Koreish the design, the approach, and the
irresistible force of the enemy. The haughty Abu Sophian presented the
keys of the city, admired the variety of arms and ensigns that passed
before him in review; observed that the son of Abdallah had acquired a
mighty kingdom, and confessed, under the cimeter of Omar, that he was
the apostle of the true God. The return of Marius and Scylla was stained
with the blood of the Romans: the revenge of Mahomet was stimulated by
religious zeal, and his injured followers were eager to execute or to
prevent the order of a massacre. Instead of indulging their passions and
his own, [139] the victorious exile forgave the guilt, and united the
factions, of Mecca. His troops, in three divisions, marched into the
city: eight-and-twenty of the inhabitants were slain by the sword of
Caled; eleven men and six women were proscribed by the sentence of
Mahomet; but he blamed the cruelty of his lieutenant; and several of the
most obnoxious victims were indebted for their lives to his clemency or
contempt. The chiefs of the Koreish were prostrate at his feet. "What
mercy can you expect from the man whom you have wronged?" "We confide
in the generosity of our kinsman." "And you shall not confide in vain:
begone! you are safe, you are free" The people of Mecca deserved their
pardon by the profession of Islam; and after an exile of seven years,
the fugitive missionary was enthroned as the prince and prophet of his
native country. [140] But the three hundred and sixty idols of the Caaba
were ignominiously broken: the house of God was purified and adorned: as
an example to future times, the apostle again fulfilled the duties of a
pilgrim; and a perpetual law was enacted that no unbeliever should dare
to set his foot on the territory of the holy city. [141]

[Footnote 138: The successive steps of the reduction of Mecca are
related by Abulfeda (p. 84-87, 97-100, 102-111) and Gagnier, (tom.
ii. p. 202-245, 309-322, tom. iii. p. 1-58,) Elmacin, (Hist. Saracen.
p. 8, 9, 10,) Abulpharagius, (Dynast. p. 103.)]

[Footnote 1381: This peaceful entrance into Mecca took place, according
to the treaty the following year. Weil, p. 202--M. 1845.]

[Footnote 139: After the conquest of Mecca, the Mahomet of Voltaire
imagines and perpetuates the most horrid crimes. The poet confesses,
that he is not supported by the truth of history, and can only allege,
que celui qui fait la guerre a sa patrie au nom de Dieu, est capable
de tout, (Oeuvres de Voltaire, tom. xv. p. 282.) The maxim is neither
charitable nor philosophic; and some reverence is surely due to the
fame of heroes and the religion of nations. I am informed that a Turkish
ambassador at Paris was much scandalized at the representation of this
tragedy.]

[Footnote 140: The Mahometan doctors still dispute, whether Mecca was
reduced by force or consent, (Abulfeda, p. 107, et Gagnier ad locum;)
and this verbal controversy is of as much moment as our own about
William the Conqueror.]

[Footnote 141: In excluding the Christians from the peninsula of
Arabia, the province of Hejaz, or the navigation of the Red Sea, Chardin
(Voyages en Perse, tom. iv. p. 166) and Reland (Dissertat. Miscell.
tom. iii. p. 61) are more rigid than the Mussulmans themselves. The
Christians are received without scruple into the ports of Mocha, and
even of Gedda; and it is only the city and precincts of Mecca that are
inaccessible to the profane, (Niebuhr, Description de l'Arabie, p. 308,
309, Voyage en Arabie, tom. i. p. 205, 248, &c.)]

The conquest of Mecca determined the faith and obedience of the Arabian
tribes; [142] who, according to the vicissitudes of fortune, had obeyed,
or disregarded, the eloquence or the arms of the prophet. Indifference
for rites and opinions still marks the character of the Bedoweens; and
they might accept, as loosely as they hold, the doctrine of the Koran.
Yet an obstinate remnant still adhered to the religion and liberty of
their ancestors, and the war of Honain derived a proper appellation from
the idols, whom Mahomet had vowed to destroy, and whom the confederates
of Tayef had sworn to defend. [143] Four thousand Pagans advanced with
secrecy and speed to surprise the conqueror: they pitied and despised
the supine negligence of the Koreish, but they depended on the wishes,
and perhaps the aid, of a people who had so lately renounced their gods,
and bowed beneath the yoke of their enemy. The banners of Medina and
Mecca were displayed by the prophet; a crowd of Bedoweens increased
the strength or numbers of the army, and twelve thousand Mussulmans
entertained a rash and sinful presumption of their invincible strength.
They descended without precaution into the valley of Honain: the heights
had been occupied by the archers and slingers of the confederates; their
numbers were oppressed, their discipline was confounded, their courage
was appalled, and the Koreish smiled at their impending destruction. The
prophet, on his white mule, was encompassed by the enemies: he attempted
to rush against their spears in search of a glorious death: ten of his
faithful companions interposed their weapons and their breasts; three of
these fell dead at his feet: "O my brethren," he repeatedly cried, with
sorrow and indignation, "I am the son of Abdallah, I am the apostle of
truth! O man, stand fast in the faith! O God, send down thy succor!" His
uncle Abbas, who, like the heroes of Homer, excelled in the loudness
of his voice, made the valley resound with the recital of the gifts and
promises of God: the flying Moslems returned from all sides to the holy
standard; and Mahomet observed with pleasure that the furnace was again
rekindled: his conduct and example restored the battle, and he animated
his victorious troops to inflict a merciless revenge on the authors of
their shame. From the field of Honain, he marched without delay to the
siege of Tayef, sixty miles to the south-east of Mecca, a fortress of
strength, whose fertile lands produce the fruits of Syria in the midst
of the Arabian desert. A friendly tribe, instructed (I know not how)
in the art of sieges, supplied him with a train of battering-rams and
military engines, with a body of five hundred artificers. But it was in
vain that he offered freedom to the slaves of Tayef; that he violated
his own laws by the extirpation of the fruit-trees; that the ground was
opened by the miners; that the breach was assaulted by the troops. After
a siege of twenty-days, the prophet sounded a retreat; but he retreated
with a song of devout triumph, and affected to pray for the repentance
and safety of the unbelieving city. The spoils of this fortunate
expedition amounted to six thousand captives, twenty-four thousand
camels, forty thousand sheep, and four thousand ounces of silver: a
tribe who had fought at Hoinan redeemed their prisoners by the sacrifice
of their idols; but Mahomet compensated the loss, by resigning to the
soldiers his fifth of the plunder, and wished, for their sake, that he
possessed as many head of cattle as there were trees in the province
of Tehama. Instead of chastising the disaffection of the Koreish, he
endeavored to cut out their tongues, (his own expression,) and to secure
their attachment by a superior measure of liberality: Abu Sophian alone
was presented with three hundred camels and twenty ounces of silver; and
Mecca was sincerely converted to the profitable religion of the Koran.

[Footnote 142: Abulfeda, p. 112-115. Gagnier, tom. iii. p. 67-88.

[Footnote 143: The siege of Tayef, division of the spoil, &c., are
related by Abulfeda (p. 117-123) and Gagnier, (tom. iii. p. 88-111.)
It is Al Jannabi who mentions the engines and engineers of the tribe of
Daws. The fertile spot of Tayef was supposed to be a piece of the land
of Syria detached and dropped in the general deluge]

The fugitives and auxiliaries complained, that they who had borne the
burden were neglected in the season of victory "Alas!" replied their
artful leader, "suffer me to conciliate these recent enemies, these
doubtful proselytes, by the gift of some perishable goods. To your guard
I intrust my life and fortunes. You are the companions of my exile, of
my kingdom, of my paradise." He was followed by the deputies of Tayef,
who dreaded the repetition of a siege. "Grant us, O apostle of God! a
truce of three years, with the toleration of our ancient worship."
"Not a month, not an hour." "Excuse us at least from the obligation of
prayer." "Without prayer religion is of no avail." They submitted
in silence: their temples were demolished, and the same sentence of
destruction was executed on all the idols of Arabia. His lieutenants,
on the shores of the Red Sea, the Ocean, and the Gulf of Persia, were
saluted by the acclamations of a faithful people; and the ambassadors,
who knelt before the throne of Medina, were as numerous (says the
Arabian proverb) as the dates that fall from the maturity of a
palm-tree. The nation submitted to the God and the sceptre of Mahomet:
the opprobrious name of tribute was abolished: the spontaneous or
reluctant oblations of arms and tithes were applied to the service of
religion; and one hundred and fourteen thousand Moslems accompanied the
last pilgrimage of the apostle. [144]

[Footnote 144: The last conquests and pilgrimage of Mahomet are
contained in Abulfeda, (p. 121, 133,) Gagnier, (tom. iii. p. 119-219,)
Elmacin, (p. 10, 11,) Abulpharagius, (p. 103.) The ixth of the Hegira
was styled the Year of Embassies, (Gagnier, Not. ad Abulfed. p. 121.)]

When Heraclius returned in triumph from the Persian war, he entertained,
at Emesa, one of the ambassadors of Mahomet, who invited the princes and
nations of the earth to the profession of Islam. On this foundation the
zeal of the Arabians has supposed the secret conversion of the Christian
emperor: the vanity of the Greeks has feigned a personal visit of the
prince of Medina, who accepted from the royal bounty a rich domain, and
a secure retreat, in the province of Syria. [145] But the friendship
of Heraclius and Mahomet was of short continuance: the new religion had
inflamed rather than assuaged the rapacious spirit of the Saracens, and
the murder of an envoy afforded a decent pretence for invading, with
three thousand soldiers, the territory of Palestine, that extends to the
eastward of the Jordan. The holy banner was intrusted to Zeid; and such
was the discipline or enthusiasm of the rising sect, that the noblest
chiefs served without reluctance under the slave of the prophet. On the
event of his decease, Jaafar and Abdallah were successively substituted
to the command; and if the three should perish in the war, the troops
were authorized to elect their general. The three leaders were slain
in the battle of Muta, [146] the first military action, which tried the
valor of the Moslems against a foreign enemy. Zeid fell, like a soldier,
in the foremost ranks: the death of Jaafar was heroic and memorable: he
lost his right hand: he shifted the standard to his left: the left
was severed from his body: he embraced the standard with his bleeding
stumps, till he was transfixed to the ground with fifty honorable
wounds. [1461] "Advance," cried Abdallah, who stepped into the vacant
place, "advance with confidence: either victory or paradise is our own."
The lance of a Roman decided the alternative; but the falling standard
was rescued by Caled, the proselyte of Mecca: nine swords were broken in
his hand; and his valor withstood and repulsed the superior numbers of
the Christians. In the nocturnal council of the camp he was chosen to
command: his skilful evolutions of the ensuing day secured either the
victory or the retreat of the Saracens; and Caled is renowned among his
brethren and his enemies by the glorious appellation of the Sword of
God. In the pulpit, Mahomet described, with prophetic rapture, the
crowns of the blessed martyrs; but in private he betrayed the feelings
of human nature: he was surprised as he wept over the daughter of Zeid:
"What do I see?" said the astonished votary. "You see," replied the
apostle, "a friend who is deploring the loss of his most faithful
friend." After the conquest of Mecca, the sovereign of Arabia affected
to prevent the hostile preparations of Heraclius; and solemnly
proclaimed war against the Romans, without attempting to disguise
the hardships and dangers of the enterprise. [147] The Moslems were
discouraged: they alleged the want of money, or horses, or provisions;
the season of harvest, and the intolerable heat of the summer: "Hell is
much hotter," said the indignant prophet. He disdained to compel
their service: but on his return he admonished the most guilty, by an
excommunication of fifty days. Their desertion enhanced the merit of
Abubeker, Othman, and the faithful companions who devoted their lives
and fortunes; and Mahomet displayed his banner at the head of ten
thousand horse and twenty thousand foot. Painful indeed was the distress
of the march: lassitude and thirst were aggravated by the scorching and
pestilential winds of the desert: ten men rode by turns on one camel;
and they were reduced to the shameful necessity of drinking the water
from the belly of that useful animal. In the mid-way, ten days' journey
from Medina and Damascus, they reposed near the grove and fountain of
Tabuc. Beyond that place Mahomet declined the prosecution of the war:
he declared himself satisfied with the peaceful intentions, he was more
probably daunted by the martial array, of the emperor of the East. But
the active and intrepid Caled spread around the terror of his name; and
the prophet received the submission of the tribes and cities, from
the Euphrates to Ailah, at the head of the Red Sea. To his Christian
subjects, Mahomet readily granted the security of their persons, the
freedom of their trade, the property of their goods, and the toleration
of their worship. [148] The weakness of their Arabian brethren had
restrained them from opposing his ambition; the disciples of Jesus
were endeared to the enemy of the Jews; and it was the interest of a
conqueror to propose a fair capitulation to the most powerful religion
of the earth.

p. 232-255) with the no less bigoted Greeks, Theophanes, (p. 276-227,)
Zonaras (tom. ii. l. xiv. p. 86,) and Cedrenus, (p. 421.)]

Abulfeda (p 100-102) and Gagnier, (tom. ii. p. 327-343.).]

[Footnote 1461: To console the afflicted relatives of his kinsman
Jauffer, he (Mahomet) represented that, in Paradise, in exchange for
the arms which he had lost, he had been furnished with a pair of wings,
resplendent with the blushing glories of the ruby, and with which he
was become the inseparable companion of the archangal Gabriel, in
his volitations through the regions of eternal bliss. Hence, in the
catalogue of the martyrs, he has been denominated Jauffer teyaur, the
winged Jauffer. Price, Chronological Retrospect of Mohammedan History,
vol. i. p. 5.-M.]

[Footnote 147: The expedition of Tabuc is recorded by our ordinary
historians Abulfeda (Vit. Moham. p. 123-127) and Gagnier, (Vie de
Mahomet, tom. iii. p. 147-163: ) but we have the advantage of appealing
to the original evidence of the Koran, (c. 9, p. 154, 165,) with Sale's
learned and rational notes.]

[Footnote 148: The Diploma securitatis Ailensibus is attested by Ahmed
Ben Joseph, and the author Libri Splendorum, (Gagnier, Not. ad Abulfe
dam, p. 125;) but Abulfeda himself, as well as Elmacin, (Hist. Saracen.
p. 11,) though he owns Mahomet's regard for the Christians, (p 13,) only
mentions peace and tribute. In the year 1630, Sionita published at Paris
the text and version of Mahomet's patent in favor of the Christians;
which was admitted and reprobated by the opposite taste of Salmasius
and Grotius, (Bayle, Mahomet, Rem. Aa.) Hottinger doubts of its
authenticity, (Hist. Orient. p. 237;) Renaudot urges the consent of the
Mohametans, (Hist. Patriarch. Alex. p. 169;) but Mosheim (Hist. Eccles.
p. 244) shows the futility of their opinion and inclines to believe
it spurious. Yet Abulpharagius quotes the impostor's treaty with the
Nestorian patriarch, (Asseman. Bibliot. Orient. tom. ii. p. 418;) but
Abulpharagius was primate of the Jacobites.]

Till the age of sixty-three years, the strength of Mahomet was equal to
the temporal and spiritual fatigues of his mission. His epileptic fits,
an absurd calumny of the Greeks, would be an object of pity rather than
abhorrence; [149] but he seriously believed that he was poisoned at
Chaibar by the revenge of a Jewish female. [150] During four years,
the health of the prophet declined; his infirmities increased; but
his mortal disease was a fever of fourteen days, which deprived him
by intervals of the use of reason. As soon as he was conscious of
his danger, he edified his brethren by the humility of his virtue or
penitence. "If there be any man," said the apostle from the pulpit,
"whom I have unjustly scourged, I submit my own back to the lash of
retaliation. Have I aspersed the reputation of a Mussulman? let him
proclaim my thoughts in the face of the congregation. Has any one been
despoiled of his goods? the little that I possess shall compensate the
principal and the interest of the debt." "Yes," replied a voice from
the crowd, "I am entitled to three drams of silver." Mahomet heard the
complaint, satisfied the demand, and thanked his creditor for accusing
him in this world rather than at the day of judgment. He beheld with
temperate firmness the approach of death; enfranchised his slaves
(seventeen men, as they are named, and eleven women;) minutely directed
the order of his funeral, and moderated the lamentations of his weeping
friends, on whom he bestowed the benediction of peace. Till the third
day before his death, he regularly performed the function of public
prayer: the choice of Abubeker to supply his place, appeared to mark
that ancient and faithful friend as his successor in the sacerdotal
and regal office; but he prudently declined the risk and envy of a
more explicit nomination. At a moment when his faculties were visibly
impaired, he called for pen and ink to write, or, more properly,
to dictate, a divine book, the sum and accomplishment of all his
revelations: a dispute arose in the chamber, whether he should be
allowed to supersede the authority of the Koran; and the prophet was
forced to reprove the indecent vehemence of his disciples. If the
slightest credit may be afforded to the traditions of his wives and
companions, he maintained, in the bosom of his family, and to the last
moments of his life, the dignity [1501] of an apostle, and the faith of
an enthusiast; described the visits of Gabriel, who bade an everlasting
farewell to the earth, and expressed his lively confidence, not only
of the mercy, but of the favor, of the Supreme Being. In a familiar
discourse he had mentioned his special prerogative, that the angel of
death was not allowed to take his soul till he had respectfully asked
the permission of the prophet. The request was granted; and Mahomet
immediately fell into the agony of his dissolution: his head was
reclined on the lap of Ayesha, the best beloved of all his wives; he
fainted with the violence of pain; recovering his spirits, he raised his
eyes towards the roof of the house, and, with a steady look, though a
faltering voice, uttered the last broken, though articulate, words:
"O God!..... pardon my sins....... Yes, ...... I come,...... among my
fellow-citizens on high;" and thus peaceably expired on a carpet spread
upon the floor. An expedition for the conquest of Syria was stopped by
this mournful event; the army halted at the gates of Medina; the chiefs
were assembled round their dying master. The city, more especially
the house, of the prophet, was a scene of clamorous sorrow of silent
despair: fanaticism alone could suggest a ray of hope and consolation.
"How can he be dead, our witness, our intercessor, our mediator, with
God? By God he is not dead: like Moses and Jesus, he is wrapped in a
holy trance, and speedily will he return to his faithful people." The
evidence of sense was disregarded; and Omar, unsheathing his cimeter,
threatened to strike off the heads of the infidels, who should dare
to affirm that the prophet was no more. The tumult was appeased by the
weight and moderation of Abubeker. "Is it Mahomet," said he to Omar and
the multitude, "or the God of Mahomet, whom you worship? The God of
Mahomet liveth forever; but the apostle was a mortal like ourselves, and
according to his own prediction, he has experienced the common fate of
mortality." He was piously interred by the hands of his nearest kinsman,
on the same spot on which he expired: [151] Medina has been sanctified
by the death and burial of Mahomet; and the innumerable pilgrims of
Mecca often turn aside from the way, to bow, in voluntary devotion,
[152] before the simple tomb of the prophet. [153]

[Footnote 149: The epilepsy, or falling-sickness, of Mahomet is asserted
by Theophanes, Zonaras, and the rest of the Greeks; and is greedily
swallowed by the gross bigotry of Hottinger, (Hist. Orient. p. 10, 11,)
Prideaux, (Life of Mahomet, p. 12,) and Maracci, (tom. ii. Alcoran, p.
762, 763.) The titles (the wrapped-up, the covered) of two chapters of
the Koran, (73, 74) can hardly be strained to such an interpretation:
the silence, the ignorance of the Mahometan commentators, is more
conclusive than the most peremptory denial; and the charitable side is
espoused by Ockley, (Hist. of the Saracens, tom. i. p. 301,) Gagnier,
(ad Abulfedam, p. 9. Vie de Mahomet, tom. i. p. 118,) and Sale, (Koran,
p. 469-474.) * Note: Dr Weil believes in the epilepsy, and adduces
strong evidence for it; and surely it may be believed, in perfect
charity; and that the prophet's visions were connected, as they appear
to have been, with these fits. I have little doubt that he saw and
believed these visions, and visions they were. Weil, p. 43.--M. 1845.]

[Footnote 150: This poison (more ignominious since it was offered as
a test of his prophetic knowledge) is frankly confessed by his zealous
votaries, Abulfeda (p. 92) and Al Jannabi, (apud Gagnier, tom. ii. p.
286-288.)]

[Footnote 1501: Major Price, who writes with the authority of one widely
conversant with the original sources of Eastern knowledge, and in a very
candid tone, takes a very different view of the prophet's death. "In
tracing the circumstances of Mahommed's illness, we look in vain for
any proofs of that meek and heroic firmness which might be expected to
dignify and embellish the last moments of the apostle of God. On some
occasions he betrayed such want of fortitude, such marks of childish
impatience, as are in general to be found in men only of the most
ordinary stamp; and such as extorted from his wife Ayesha, in
particular, the sarcastic remark, that in herself, or any of her
family, a similar demeanor would long since have incurred his severe
displeasure. * * * He said that the acuteness and violence of his
sufferings were necessarily in the proportion of those honors with which
it had ever pleased the hand of Omnipotence to distinguish its peculiar
favorites." Price, vol. i. p. 13.--M]

[Footnote 151: The Greeks and Latins have invented and propagated the
vulgar and ridiculous story, that Mahomet's iron tomb is suspended in
the air at Mecca, (Laonicus Chalcondyles, de Rebus Turcicis, l. iii.
p. 66,) by the action of equal and potent loadstones, (Dictionnaire de
Bayle, Mahomet, Rem. Ee. Ff.) Without any philosophical inquiries, it
may suffice, that, 1. The prophet was not buried at Mecca; and, 2. That
his tomb at Medina, which has been visited by millions, is placed on the
ground, (Reland, de Relig. Moham. l. ii. c. 19, p. 209-211. Gagnier,
Vie de Mahomet, tom. iii. p. 263-268.) * Note: According to the
testimony of all the Eastern authors, Mahomet died on Monday the 12th
Reby 1st, in the year 11 of the Hegira, which answers in reality to the
8th June, 632, of J. C. We find in Ockley (Hist. of Saracens) that it
was on Monday the 6th June, 632. This is a mistake; for the 6th June of
that year was a Saturday, not a Monday; the 8th June, therefore, was a
Monday. It is easy to discover that the lunar year, in this calculation
has been confounded with the solar. St. Martin vol. xi. p. 186.--M.]

[Footnote 152: Al Jannabi enumerates (Vie de Mahomet, tom. iii. p.
372-391) the multifarious duties of a pilgrim who visits the tombs of
the prophet and his companions; and the learned casuist decides, that
this act of devotion is nearest in obligation and merit to a divine
precept. The doctors are divided which, of Mecca or Medina, be the most
excellent, (p. 391-394.)]

[Footnote 153: The last sickness, death, and burial of Mahomet, are
described by Abulfeda and Gagnier, (Vit. Moham. p. 133-142. --Vie
de Mahomet, tom. iii. p. 220-271.) The most private and interesting
circumstances were originally received from Ayesha, Ali, the sons of
Abbas, &c.; and as they dwelt at Medina, and survived the prophet many
years, they might repeat the pious tale to a second or third generation
of pilgrims.]

At the conclusion of the life of Mahomet, it may perhaps be expected,
that I should balance his faults and virtues, that I should decide
whether the title of enthusiast or impostor more properly belongs to
that extraordinary man. Had I been intimately conversant with the son of
Abdallah, the task would still be difficult, and the success uncertain:
at the distance of twelve centuries, I darkly contemplate his shade
through a cloud of religious incense; and could I truly delineate the
portrait of an hour, the fleeting resemblance would not equally apply
to the solitary of Mount Hera, to the preacher of Mecca, and to the
conqueror of Arabia. The author of a mighty revolution appears to have
been endowed with a pious and contemplative disposition: so soon as
marriage had raised him above the pressure of want, he avoided the
paths of ambition and avarice; and till the age of forty he lived with
innocence, and would have died without a name. The unity of God is an
idea most congenial to nature and reason; and a slight conversation
with the Jews and Christians would teach him to despise and detest the
idolatry of Mecca. It was the duty of a man and a citizen to impart the
doctrine of salvation, to rescue his country from the dominion of sin
and error. The energy of a mind incessantly bent on the same object,
would convert a general obligation into a particular call; the warm
suggestions of the understanding or the fancy would be felt as the
inspirations of Heaven; the labor of thought would expire in rapture
and vision; and the inward sensation, the invisible monitor, would be
described with the form and attributes of an angel of God. [154] From
enthusiasm to imposture, the step is perilous and slippery: the daemon
of Socrates [155] affords a memorable instance, how a wise man may
deceive himself, how a good man may deceive others, how the conscience
may slumber in a mixed and middle state between self-illusion and
voluntary fraud. Charity may believe that the original motives of
Mahomet were those of pure and genuine benevolence; but a human
missionary is incapable of cherishing the obstinate unbelievers who
reject his claims despise his arguments, and persecute his life; he
might forgive his personal adversaries, he may lawfully hate the enemies
of God; the stern passions of pride and revenge were kindled in the
bosom of Mahomet, and he sighed, like the prophet of Nineveh, for the
destruction of the rebels whom he had condemned. The injustice of Mecca
and the choice of Medina, transformed the citizen into a prince, the
humble preacher into the leader of armies; but his sword was consecrated
by the example of the saints; and the same God who afflicts a sinful
world with pestilence and earthquakes, might inspire for their
conversion or chastisement the valor of his servants. In the exercise
of political government, he was compelled to abate of the stern rigor of
fanaticism, to comply in some measure with the prejudices and passions
of his followers, and to employ even the vices of mankind as the
instruments of their salvation. The use of fraud and perfidy, of cruelty
and injustice, were often subservient to the propagation of the faith;
and Mahomet commanded or approved the assassination of the Jews and
idolaters who had escaped from the field of battle. By the repetition
of such acts, the character of Mahomet must have been gradually stained;
and the influence of such pernicious habits would be poorly compensated
by the practice of the personal and social virtues which are necessary
to maintain the reputation of a prophet among his sectaries and friends.
Of his last years, ambition was the ruling passion; and a politician
will suspect, that he secretly smiled (the victorious impostor!) at the
enthusiasm of his youth, and the credulity of his proselytes. [156] A
philosopher will observe, that their credulity and his success would
tend more strongly to fortify the assurance of his divine mission,
that his interest and religion were inseparably connected, and that
his conscience would be soothed by the persuasion, that he alone was
absolved by the Deity from the obligation of positive and moral laws. If
he retained any vestige of his native innocence, the sins of Mahomet may
be allowed as an evidence of his sincerity. In the support of truth, the
arts of fraud and fiction may be deemed less criminal; and he would have
started at the foulness of the means, had he not been satisfied of the
importance and justice of the end. Even in a conqueror or a priest, I
can surprise a word or action of unaffected humanity; and the decree
of Mahomet, that, in the sale of captives, the mothers should never be
separated from their children, may suspend, or moderate, the censure of
the historian. [157]

[Footnote 154: The Christians, rashly enough, have assigned to Mahomet a
tame pigeon, that seemed to descend from heaven and whisper in his ear.
As this pretended miracle is urged by Grotius, (de Veritate Religionis
Christianae,) his Arabic translator, the learned Pocock, inquired of him
the names of his authors; and Grotius confessed, that it is unknown to
the Mahometans themselves. Lest it should provoke their indignation and
laughter, the pious lie is suppressed in the Arabic version; but it has
maintained an edifying place in the numerous editions of the Latin
text, (Pocock, Specimen, Hist. Arabum, p. 186, 187. Reland, de Religion.
Moham. l. ii. c. 39, p. 259-262.)]

[Footnote 155: (Plato, in Apolog. Socrat. c. 19, p. 121, 122, edit.
Fischer.) The familiar examples, which Socrates urges in his Dialogue
with Theages, (Platon. Opera, tom. i. p. 128, 129, edit. Hen. Stephan.)
are beyond the reach of human foresight; and the divine inspiration of
the philosopher is clearly taught in the Memorabilia of Xenophon. The
ideas of the most rational Platonists are expressed by Cicero, (de
Divinat. i. 54,) and in the xivth and xvth Dissertations of Maximus of
Tyre, (p. 153-172, edit. Davis.)]

[Footnote 156: In some passage of his voluminous writings, Voltaire
compares the prophet, in his old age, to a fakir, "qui detache la chaine
de son cou pour en donner sur les oreilles a ses confreres."]

[Footnote 157: Gagnier relates, with the same impartial pen, this humane
law of the prophet, and the murders of Caab, and Sophian, which he
prompted and approved, (Vie de Mahomet, tom. ii. p. 69, 97, 208.)]
