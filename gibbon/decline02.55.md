In the second year of the reign of Valentinian and Valens, on the
morning of the twenty-first day of July, the greatest part of the Roman
world was shaken by a violent and destructive earthquake. The impression
was communicated to the waters; the shores of the Mediterranean were
left dry, by the sudden retreat of the sea; great quantities of fish
were caught with the hand; large vessels were stranded on the mud; and
a curious spectator [1] amused his eye, or rather his fancy, by
contemplating the various appearance of valleys and mountains, which had
never, since the formation of the globe, been exposed to the sun. But
the tide soon returned, with the weight of an immense and irresistible
deluge, which was severely felt on the coasts of Sicily, of Dalmatia,
of Greece, and of Egypt: large boats were transported, and lodged on
the roofs of houses, or at the distance of two miles from the shore; the
people, with their habitations, were swept away by the waters; and the
city of Alexandria annually commemorated the fatal day, on which fifty
thousand persons had lost their lives in the inundation. This calamity,
the report of which was magnified from one province to another,
astonished and terrified the subjects of Rome; and their affrighted
imagination enlarged the real extent of a momentary evil. They
recollected the preceding earthquakes, which had subverted the cities
of Palestine and Bithynia: they considered these alarming strokes as the
prelude only of still more dreadful calamities, and their fearful
vanity was disposed to confound the symptoms of a declining empire and
a sinking world. [2] It was the fashion of the times to attribute every
remarkable event to the particular will of the Deity; the alterations
of nature were connected, by an invisible chain, with the moral and
metaphysical opinions of the human mind; and the most sagacious
divines could distinguish, according to the color of their respective
prejudices, that the establishment of heresy tended to produce an
earthquake; or that a deluge was the inevitable consequence of the
progress of sin and error. Without presuming to discuss the truth or
propriety of these lofty speculations, the historian may content himself
with an observation, which seems to be justified by experience, that man
has much more to fear from the passions of his fellow-creatures, than
from the convulsions of the elements. [3] The mischievous effects of an
earthquake, or deluge, a hurricane, or the eruption of a volcano, bear
a very inconsiderable portion to the ordinary calamities of war, as they
are now moderated by the prudence or humanity of the princes of Europe,
who amuse their own leisure, and exercise the courage of their subjects,
in the practice of the military art. But the laws and manners of modern
nations protect the safety and freedom of the vanquished soldier; and
the peaceful citizen has seldom reason to complain, that his life,
or even his fortune, is exposed to the rage of war. In the disastrous
period of the fall of the Roman empire, which may justly be dated from
the reign of Valens, the happiness and security of each individual were
personally attacked; and the arts and labors of ages were rudely defaced
by the Barbarians of Scythia and Germany. The invasion of the Huns
precipitated on the provinces of the West the Gothic nation, which
advanced, in less than forty years, from the Danube to the Atlantic, and
opened a way, by the success of their arms, to the inroads of so many
hostile tribes, more savage than themselves. The original principle
of motion was concealed in the remote countries of the North; and
the curious observation of the pastoral life of the Scythians, [4]
or Tartars, [5] will illustrate the latent cause of these destructive
emigrations.

[Footnote 1: Such is the bad taste of Ammianus, (xxvi. 10,) that it is
not easy to distinguish his facts from his metaphors. Yet he positively
affirms, that he saw the rotten carcass of a ship, ad Modon, in
Peloponnesus.]

[Footnote 2: The earthquakes and inundations are variously described by
Libanius, (Orat. de ulciscenda Juliani nece, c. x., in Fabricius, Bibl.
Graec. tom. vii. p. 158, with a learned note of Olearius,) Zosimus, (l.
iv. p. 221,) Sozomen, (l. vi. c. 2,) Cedrenus, (p. 310, 314,) and Jerom,
(in Chron. p. 186, and tom. i. p. 250, in Vit. Hilarion.) Epidaurus must
have been overwhelmed, had not the prudent citizens placed St. Hilarion,
an Egyptian monk, on the beach. He made the sign of the Cross; the
mountain-wave stopped, bowed, and returned.]

[Footnote 3: Dicaearchus, the Peripatetic, composed a formal treatise,
to prove this obvious truth; which is not the most honorable to the
human species. (Cicero, de Officiis, ii. 5.)]

[Footnote 4: The original Scythians of Herodotus (l. iv. c. 47--57,
99--101) were confined, by the Danube and the Palus Maeotis, within
a square of 4000 stadia, (400 Roman miles.) See D'Anville (Mem. de
l'Academie, tom. xxxv. p. 573--591.) Diodorus Siculus (tom. i. l. ii.
p. 155, edit. Wesseling) has marked the gradual progress of the name and
nation.]

[Footnote 5: The Tatars, or Tartars, were a primitive tribe, the rivals,
and at length the subjects, of the Moguls. In the victorious armies of
Zingis Khan, and his successors, the Tartars formed the vanguard; and
the name, which first reached the ears of foreigners, was applied to the
whole nation, (Freret, in the Hist. de l'Academie, tom. xviii. p. 60.)
In speaking of all, or any of the northern shepherds of Europe, or Asia,
I indifferently use the appellations of Scythians or Tartars. * Note:
The Moguls, (Mongols,) according to M. Klaproth, are a tribe of the
Tartar nation. Tableaux Hist. de l'Asie, p. 154.--M.]

The different characters that mark the civilized nations of the globe,
may be ascribed to the use, and the abuse, of reason; which so variously
shapes, and so artificially composes, the manners and opinions of a
European, or a Chinese. But the operation of instinct is more sure and
simple than that of reason: it is much easier to ascertain the appetites
of a quadruped than the speculations of a philosopher; and the savage
tribes of mankind, as they approach nearer to the condition of animals,
preserve a stronger resemblance to themselves and to each other. The
uniform stability of their manners is the natural consequence of the
imperfection of their faculties. Reduced to a similar situation, their
wants, their desires, their enjoyments, still continue the same: and
the influence of food or climate, which, in a more improved state
of society, is suspended, or subdued, by so many moral causes, most
powerfully contributes to form, and to maintain, the national character
of Barbarians. In every age, the immense plains of Scythia, or Tartary,
have been inhabited by vagrant tribes of hunters and shepherds, whose
indolence refuses to cultivate the earth, and whose restless spirit
disdains the confinement of a sedentary life. In every age, the
Scythians, and Tartars, have been renowned for their invincible courage
and rapid conquests. The thrones of Asia have been repeatedly overturned
by the shepherds of the North; and their arms have spread terror and
devastation over the most fertile and warlike countries of Europe. [6]
On this occasion, as well as on many others, the sober historian is
forcibly awakened from a pleasing vision; and is compelled, with some
reluctance, to confess, that the pastoral manners, which have been
adorned with the fairest attributes of peace and innocence, are much
better adapted to the fierce and cruel habits of a military life. To
illustrate this observation, I shall now proceed to consider a nation of
shepherds and of warriors, in the three important articles of, I. Their
diet; II. Their habitations; and, III. Their exercises. The narratives
of antiquity are justified by the experience of modern times; [7] and
the banks of the Borysthenes, of the Volga, or of the Selinga, will
indifferently present the same uniform spectacle of similar and native
manners. [8]

[Footnote 6: Imperium Asiae ter quaesivere: ipsi perpetuo ab alieno
imperio, aut intacti aut invicti, mansere. Since the time of Justin,
(ii. 2,) they have multiplied this account. Voltaire, in a few words,
(tom. x. p. 64, Hist. Generale, c. 156,) has abridged the Tartar
conquests. Oft o'er the trembling nations from afar, Has Scythia
breathed the living cloud of war. Note *: Gray.--M.]

[Footnote 7: The fourth book of Herodotus affords a curious though
imperfect, portrait of the Scythians. Among the moderns, who describe
the uniform scene, the Khan of Khowaresm, Abulghazi Bahadur, expresses
his native feelings; and his genealogical history of the Tartars has
been copiously illustrated by the French and English editors. Carpin,
Ascelin, and Rubruquis (in the Hist. des Voyages, tom. vii.) represent
the Moguls of the fourteenth century. To these guides I have added
Gerbillon, and the other Jesuits, (Description de la China par du Halde,
tom. iv.,) who accurately surveyed the Chinese Tartary; and that honest
and intelligent traveller, Bell, of Antermony, (two volumes in 4to.
Glasgow, 1763.) * Note: Of the various works published since the time of
Gibbon, which throw fight on the nomadic population of Central Asia, may
be particularly remarked the Travels and Dissertations of Pallas; and
above all, the very curious work of Bergman, Nomadische Streifereyen.

[Footnote 8: The Uzbecks are the most altered from their primitive
manners; 1. By the profession of the Mahometan religion; and 2. By the
possession of the cities and harvests of the great Bucharia.]

I. The corn, or even the rice, which constitutes the ordinary and
wholesome food of a civilized people, can be obtained only by the
patient toil of the husbandman. Some of the happy savages, who dwell
between the tropics, are plentifully nourished by the liberality of
nature; but in the climates of the North, a nation of shepherds is
reduced to their flocks and herds. The skilful practitioners of the
medical art will determine (if they are able to determine) how far the
temper of the human mind may be affected by the use of animal, or of
vegetable, food; and whether the common association of carniverous
and cruel deserves to be considered in any other light than that of an
innocent, perhaps a salutary, prejudice of humanity. [9] Yet, if it be
true, that the sentiment of compassion is imperceptibly weakened by the
sight and practice of domestic cruelty, we may observe, that the horrid
objects which are disguised by the arts of European refinement, are
exhibited in their naked and most disgusting simplicity in the tent of
a Tartarian shepherd. The ox, or the sheep, are slaughtered by the same
hand from which they were accustomed to receive their daily food; and
the bleeding limbs are served, with very little preparation, on the
table of their unfeeling murderer. In the military profession, and
especially in the conduct of a numerous army, the exclusive use of
animal food appears to be productive of the most solid advantages. Corn
is a bulky and perishable commodity; and the large magazines, which
are indispensably necessary for the subsistence of our troops, must be
slowly transported by the labor of men or horses. But the flocks and
herds, which accompany the march of the Tartars, afford a sure and
increasing supply of flesh and milk: in the far greater part of the
uncultivated waste, the vegetation of the grass is quick and luxuriant;
and there are few places so extremely barren, that the hardy cattle of
the North cannot find some tolerable pasture.

The supply is multiplied and prolonged by the undistinguishing appetite,
and patient abstinence, of the Tartars. They indifferently feed on the
flesh of those animals that have been killed for the table, or have
died of disease. Horseflesh, which in every age and country has been
proscribed by the civilized nations of Europe and Asia, they devour with
peculiar greediness; and this singular taste facilitates the success
of their military operations. The active cavalry of Scythia is always
followed, in their most distant and rapid incursions, by an adequate
number of spare horses, who may be occasionally used, either to redouble
the speed, or to satisfy the hunger, of the Barbarians. Many are the
resources of courage and poverty. When the forage round a camp of
Tartars is almost consumed, they slaughter the greatest part of their
cattle, and preserve the flesh, either smoked, or dried in the sun. On
the sudden emergency of a hasty march, they provide themselves with a
sufficient quantity of little balls of cheese, or rather of hard curd,
which they occasionally dissolve in water; and this unsubstantial diet
will support, for many days, the life, and even the spirits, of the
patient warrior. But this extraordinary abstinence, which the Stoic
would approve, and the hermit might envy, is commonly succeeded by the
most voracious indulgence of appetite. The wines of a happier climate
are the most grateful present, or the most valuable commodity, that can
be offered to the Tartars; and the only example of their industry seems
to consist in the art of extracting from mare's milk a fermented liquor,
which possesses a very strong power of intoxication. Like the animals
of prey, the savages, both of the old and new world, experience the
alternate vicissitudes of famine and plenty; and their stomach is inured
to sustain, without much inconvenience, the opposite extremes of hunger
and of intemperance.

[Footnote 9: Il est certain que les grands mangeurs de viande sont en
general cruels et feroces plus que les autres hommes. Cette observation
est de tous les lieux, et de tous les temps: la barbarie Angloise est
connue, &c. Emile de Rousseau, tom. i. p. 274. Whatever we may think
of the general observation, we shall not easily allow the truth of
his example. The good-natured complaints of Plutarch, and the pathetic
lamentations of Ovid, seduce our reason, by exciting our sensibility.]

II. In the ages of rustic and martial simplicity, a people of soldiers
and husbandmen are dispersed over the face of an extensive and
cultivated country; and some time must elapse before the warlike youth
of Greece or Italy could be assembled under the same standard, either to
defend their own confines, or to invade the territories of the adjacent
tribes. The progress of manufactures and commerce insensibly collects
a large multitude within the walls of a city: but these citizens are no
longer soldiers; and the arts which adorn and improve the state of civil
society, corrupt the habits of the military life. The pastoral manners
of the Scythians seem to unite the different advantages of simplicity
and refinement. The individuals of the same tribe are constantly
assembled, but they are assembled in a camp; and the native spirit of
these dauntless shepherds is animated by mutual support and emulation.
The houses of the Tartars are no more than small tents, of an oval form,
which afford a cold and dirty habitation, for the promiscuous youth of
both sexes. The palaces of the rich consist of wooden huts, of such a
size that they may be conveniently fixed on large wagons, and drawn by
a team perhaps of twenty or thirty oxen. The flocks and herds, after
grazing all day in the adjacent pastures, retire, on the approach of
night, within the protection of the camp. The necessity of preventing
the most mischievous confusion, in such a perpetual concourse of men and
animals, must gradually introduce, in the distribution, the order, and
the guard, of the encampment, the rudiments of the military art. As soon
as the forage of a certain district is consumed, the tribe, or rather
army, of shepherds, makes a regular march to some fresh pastures; and
thus acquires, in the ordinary occupations of the pastoral life,
the practical knowledge of one of the most important and difficult
operations of war. The choice of stations is regulated by the difference
of the seasons: in the summer, the Tartars advance towards the North,
and pitch their tents on the banks of a river, or, at least, in the
neighborhood of a running stream. But in the winter, they return to the
South, and shelter their camp, behind some convenient eminence, against
the winds, which are chilled in their passage over the bleak and icy
regions of Siberia. These manners are admirably adapted to diffuse,
among the wandering tribes, the spirit of emigration and conquest.
The connection between the people and their territory is of so frail a
texture, that it may be broken by the slightest accident. The camp, and
not the soil, is the native country of the genuine Tartar. Within the
precincts of that camp, his family, his companions, his property,
are always included; and, in the most distant marches, he is still
surrounded by the objects which are dear, or valuable, or familiar in
his eyes. The thirst of rapine, the fear, or the resentment of injury,
the impatience of servitude, have, in every age, been sufficient causes
to urge the tribes of Scythia boldly to advance into some unknown
countries, where they might hope to find a more plentiful subsistence
or a less formidable enemy. The revolutions of the North have frequently
determined the fate of the South; and in the conflict of hostile
nations, the victor and the vanquished have alternately drove, and been
driven, from the confines of China to those of Germany. [10] These great
emigrations, which have been sometimes executed with almost incredible
diligence, were rendered more easy by the peculiar nature of the
climate. It is well known that the cold of Tartary is much more severe
than in the midst of the temperate zone might reasonably be expected;
this uncommon rigor is attributed to the height of the plains, which
rise, especially towards the East, more than half a mile above the level
of the sea; and to the quantity of saltpetre with which the soil is
deeply impregnated. [11] In the winter season, the broad and rapid
rivers, that discharge their waters into the Euxine, the Caspian, or the
Icy Sea, are strongly frozen; the fields are covered with a bed of snow;
and the fugitive, or victorious, tribes may securely traverse, with
their families, their wagons, and their cattle, the smooth and hard
surface of an immense plain.

[Footnote 10: These Tartar emigrations have been discovered by M.
de Guignes (Histoire des Huns, tom. i. ii.) a skilful and laborious
interpreter of the Chinese language; who has thus laid open new and
important scenes in the history of mankind.]

[Footnote 11: A plain in the Chinese Tartary, only eighty leagues from
the great wall, was found by the missionaries to be three thousand
geometrical paces above the level of the sea. Montesquieu, who has used,
and abused, the relations of travellers, deduces the revolutions of
Asia from this important circumstance, that heat and cold, weakness and
strength, touch each other without any temperate zone, (Esprit des Loix,
l. xvii. c. 3.)]

III. The pastoral life, compared with the labors of agriculture and
manufactures, is undoubtedly a life of idleness; and as the most
honorable shepherds of the Tartar race devolve on their captives the
domestic management of the cattle, their own leisure is seldom disturbed
by any servile and assiduous cares. But this leisure, instead of being
devoted to the soft enjoyments of love and harmony, is use fully spent
in the violent and sanguinary exercise of the chase. The plains of
Tartary are filled with a strong and serviceable breed of horses, which
are easily trained for the purposes of war and hunting. The Scythians of
every age have been celebrated as bold and skilful riders; and constant
practice had seated them so firmly on horseback, that they were supposed
by strangers to perform the ordinary duties of civil life, to eat, to
drink, and even to sleep, without dismounting from their steeds. They
excel in the dexterous management of the lance; the long Tartar bow
is drawn with a nervous arm; and the weighty arrow is directed to its
object with unerring aim and irresistible force. These arrows are often
pointed against the harmless animals of the desert, which increase and
multiply in the absence of their most formidable enemy; the hare, the
goat, the roebuck, the fallow-deer, the stag, the elk, and the antelope.
The vigor and patience, both of the men and horses, are continually
exercised by the fatigues of the chase; and the plentiful supply of game
contributes to the subsistence, and even luxury, of a Tartar camp.
But the exploits of the hunters of Scythia are not confined to the
destruction of timid or innoxious beasts; they boldly encounter the
angry wild boar, when he turns against his pursuers, excite the sluggish
courage of the bear, and provoke the fury of the tiger, as he slumbers
in the thicket. Where there is danger, there may be glory; and the mode
of hunting, which opens the fairest field to the exertions of valor,
may justly be considered as the image, and as the school, of war. The
general hunting matches, the pride and delight of the Tartar princes,
compose an instructive exercise for their numerous cavalry. A circle
is drawn, of many miles in circumference, to encompass the game of
an extensive district; and the troops that form the circle regularly
advance towards a common centre; where the captive animals, surrounded
on every side, are abandoned to the darts of the hunters. In this march,
which frequently continues many days, the cavalry are obliged to climb
the hills, to swim the rivers, and to wind through the valleys, without
interrupting the prescribed order of their gradual progress. They
acquire the habit of directing their eye, and their steps, to a remote
object; of preserving their intervals of suspending or accelerating
their pace, according to the motions of the troops on their right and
left; and of watching and repeating the signals of their leaders. Their
leaders study, in this practical school, the most important lesson
of the military art; the prompt and accurate judgment of ground, of
distance, and of time. To employ against a human enemy the same patience
and valor, the same skill and discipline, is the only alteration which
is required in real war; and the amusements of the chase serve as a
prelude to the conquest of an empire. [12]

[Footnote 12: Petit de la Croix (Vie de Gengiscan, l. iii. c. 6)
represents the full glory and extent of the Mogul chase. The Jesuits
Gerbillon and Verbiest followed the emperor Khamhi when he hunted in
Tartary, Duhalde, (Description de la Chine, tom. iv. p. 81, 290, &c.,
folio edit.) His grandson, Kienlong, who unites the Tartar discipline
with the laws and learning of China, describes (Eloge de Moukden,
p. 273--285) as a poet the pleasures which he had often enjoyed as a
sportsman.]

The political society of the ancient Germans has the appearance of
a voluntary alliance of independent warriors. The tribes of Scythia,
distinguished by the modern appellation of Hords, assume the form of
a numerous and increasing family; which, in the course of successive
generations, has been propagated from the same original stock. The
meanest, and most ignorant, of the Tartars, preserve, with conscious
pride, the inestimable treasure of their genealogy; and whatever
distinctions of rank may have been introduced, by the unequal
distribution of pastoral wealth, they mutually respect themselves, and
each other, as the descendants of the first founder of the tribe. The
custom, which still prevails, of adopting the bravest and most faithful
of the captives, may countenance the very probable suspicion, that this
extensive consanguinity is, in a great measure, legal and fictitious.
But the useful prejudice, which has obtained the sanction of time and
opinion, produces the effects of truth; the haughty Barbarians yield a
cheerful and voluntary obedience to the head of their blood; and their
chief, or mursa, as the representative of their great father, exercises
the authority of a judge in peace, and of a leader in war. In the
original state of the pastoral world, each of the mursas (if we may
continue to use a modern appellation) acted as the independent chief
of a large and separate family; and the limits of their peculiar
territories were gradually fixed by superior force, or mutual consent.
But the constant operation of various and permanent causes contributed
to unite the vagrant Hords into national communities, under the command
of a supreme head. The weak were desirous of support, and the strong
were ambitious of dominion; the power, which is the result of union,
oppressed and collected the divided force of the adjacent tribes;
and, as the vanquished were freely admitted to share the advantages of
victory, the most valiant chiefs hastened to range themselves and their
followers under the formidable standard of a confederate nation. The
most successful of the Tartar princes assumed the military command, to
which he was entitled by the superiority, either of merit or of power.
He was raised to the throne by the acclamations of his equals; and the
title of Khan expresses, in the language of the North of Asia, the full
extent of the regal dignity. The right of hereditary succession was long
confined to the blood of the founder of the monarchy; and at this moment
all the Khans, who reign from Crimea to the wall of China, are the
lineal descendants of the renowned Zingis. [13] But, as it is the
indispensable duty of a Tartar sovereign to lead his warlike subjects
into the field, the claims of an infant are often disregarded; and some
royal kinsman, distinguished by his age and valor, is intrusted with the
sword and sceptre of his predecessor. Two distinct and regular taxes are
levied on the tribes, to support the dignity of the national monarch,
and of their peculiar chief; and each of those contributions amounts
to the tithe, both of their property, and of their spoil. A Tartar
sovereign enjoys the tenth part of the wealth of his people; and as
his own domestic riches of flocks and herds increase in a much larger
proportion, he is able plentifully to maintain the rustic splendor of
his court, to reward the most deserving, or the most favored of his
followers, and to obtain, from the gentle influence of corruption, the
obedience which might be sometimes refused to the stern mandates of
authority. The manners of his subjects, accustomed, like himself, to
blood and rapine, might excuse, in their eyes, such partial acts of
tyranny, as would excite the horror of a civilized people; but the power
of a despot has never been acknowledged in the deserts of Scythia. The
immediate jurisdiction of the khan is confined within the limits of his
own tribe; and the exercise of his royal prerogative has been moderated
by the ancient institution of a national council. The Coroulai, [14] or
Diet, of the Tartars, was regularly held in the spring and autumn, in
the midst of a plain; where the princes of the reigning family, and the
mursas of the respective tribes, may conveniently assemble on horseback,
with their martial and numerous trains; and the ambitious monarch, who
reviewed the strength, must consult the inclination of an armed
people. The rudiments of a feudal government may be discovered in
the constitution of the Scythian or Tartar nations; but the perpetual
conflict of those hostile nations has sometimes terminated in the
establishment of a powerful and despotic empire. The victor, enriched
by the tribute, and fortified by the arms of dependent kings, has spread
his conquests over Europe or Asia: the successful shepherds of the North
have submitted to the confinement of arts, of laws, and of cities; and
the introduction of luxury, after destroying the freedom of the people,
has undermined the foundations of the throne. [15]

[Footnote 13: See the second volume of the Genealogical History of the
Tartars; and the list of the Khans, at the end of the life of Geng's, or
Zingis. Under the reign of Timur, or Tamerlane, one of his subjects, a
descendant of Zingis, still bore the regal appellation of Khan and the
conqueror of Asia contented himself with the title of Emir or Sultan.

[Footnote 14: See the Diets of the ancient Huns, (De Guignes, tom. ii.
p. 26,) and a curious description of those of Zingis, (Vie de Gengiscan,
l. i. c. 6, l. iv. c. 11.) Such assemblies are frequently mentioned in
the Persian history of Timur; though they served only to countenance the
resolutions of their master.]

[Footnote 15: Montesquieu labors to explain a difference, which has not
existed, between the liberty of the Arabs, and the perpetual slavery of
the Tartars. (Esprit des Loix, l. xvii. c. 5, l. xviii. c. 19, &c.)]

The memory of past events cannot long be preserved in the frequent and
remote emigrations of illiterate Barbarians. The modern Tartars are
ignorant of the conquests of their ancestors; [16] and our knowledge of
the history of the Scythians is derived from their intercourse with the
learned and civilized nations of the South, the Greeks, the Persians,
and the Chinese. The Greeks, who navigated the Euxine, and planted their
colonies along the sea-coast, made the gradual and imperfect discovery
of Scythia; from the Danube, and the confines of Thrace, as far as the
frozen Maeotis, the seat of eternal winter, and Mount Caucasus, which,
in the language of poetry, was described as the utmost boundary of
the earth. They celebrated, with simple credulity, the virtues of the
pastoral life: [17] they entertained a more rational apprehension of the
strength and numbers of the warlike Barbarians, [18] who contemptuously
baffled the immense armament of Darius, the son of Hystaspes. [19] The
Persian monarchs had extended their western conquests to the banks of
the Danube, and the limits of European Scythia. The eastern provinces of
their empire were exposed to the Scythians of Asia; the wild inhabitants
of the plains beyond the Oxus and the Jaxartes, two mighty rivers, which
direct their course towards the Caspian Sea. The long and memorable
quarrel of Iran and Touran is still the theme of history or romance: the
famous, perhaps the fabulous, valor of the Persian heroes, Rustan and
Asfendiar, was signalized, in the defence of their country, against
the Afrasiabs of the North; [20] and the invincible spirit of the same
Barbarians resisted, on the same ground, the victorious arms of Cyrus
and Alexander. [21] In the eyes of the Greeks and Persians, the real
geography of Scythia was bounded, on the East, by the mountains
of Imaus, or Caf; and their distant prospect of the extreme and
inaccessible parts of Asia was clouded by ignorance, or perplexed by
fiction. But those inaccessible regions are the ancient residence of
a powerful and civilized nation, [22] which ascends, by a probable
tradition, above forty centuries; [23] and which is able to verify
a series of near two thousand years, by the perpetual testimony of
accurate and contemporary historians. [24] The annals of China [25]
illustrate the state and revolutions of the pastoral tribes, which
may still be distinguished by the vague appellation of Scythians, or
Tartars; the vassals, the enemies, and sometimes the conquerors, of a
great empire; whose policy has uniformly opposed the blind and impetuous
valor of the Barbarians of the North. From the mouth of the Danube to
the Sea of Japan, the whole longitude of Scythia is about one hundred
and ten degrees, which, in that parallel, are equal to more than five
thousand miles. The latitude of these extensive deserts cannot be so
easily, or so accurately, measured; but, from the fortieth degree, which
touches the wall of China, we may securely advance above a thousand
miles to the northward, till our progress is stopped by the excessive
cold of Siberia. In that dreary climate, instead of the animated picture
of a Tartar camp, the smoke that issues from the earth, or rather from
the snow, betrays the subterraneous dwellings of the Tongouses, and the
Samoides: the want of horses and oxen is imperfectly supplied by the
use of reindeer, and of large dogs; and the conquerors of the earth
insensibly degenerate into a race of deformed and diminutive savages,
who tremble at the sound of arms. [26]

[Footnote 16: Abulghasi Khan, in the two first parts of his Genealogical
History, relates the miserable tales and traditions of the Uzbek Tartars
concerning the times which preceded the reign of Zingis. * Note: The
differences between the various pastoral tribes and nations comprehended
by the ancients under the vague name of Scythians, and by Gibbon under
inst of Tartars, have received some, and still, perhaps, may receive
more, light from the comparisons of their dialects and languages by
modern scholars.--M]

[Footnote 17: In the thirteenth book of the Iliad, Jupiter turns away
his eyes from the bloody fields of Troy, to the plains of Thrace and
Scythia. He would not, by changing the prospect, behold a more peaceful
or innocent scene.]

[Footnote 18: Thucydides, l. ii. c. 97.]

[Footnote 19: See the fourth book of Herodotus. When Darius advanced
into the Moldavian desert, between the Danube and the Niester, the king
of the Scythians sent him a mouse, a frog, a bird, and five arrows; a
tremendous allegory!]

[Footnote 20: These wars and heroes may be found under their respective
titles, in the Bibliotheque Orientale of D'Herbelot. They have been
celebrated in an epic poem of sixty thousand rhymed couplets, by
Ferdusi, the Homer of Persia. See the history of Nadir Shah, p. 145,
165. The public must lament that Mr. Jones has suspended the pursuit of
Oriental learning. Note: Ferdusi is yet imperfectly known to European
readers. An abstract of the whole poem has been published by Goerres
in German, under the title "das Heldenbuch des Iran." In English, an
abstract with poetical translations, by Mr. Atkinson, has appeared,
under the auspices of the Oriental Fund. But to translate a poet a man
must be a poet. The best account of the poem is in an article by Von
Hammer in the Vienna Jahrbucher, 1820: or perhaps in a masterly article
in Cochrane's Foreign Quarterly Review, No. 1, 1835. A splendid and
critical edition of the whole work has been published by a very learned
English Orientalist, Captain Macan, at the expense of the king of Oude.
As to the number of 60,000 couplets, Captain Macan (Preface, p. 39)
states that he never saw a MS. containing more than 56,685, including
doubtful and spurious passages and episodes.--M. * Note: The later
studies of Sir W. Jones were more in unison with the wishes of the
public, thus expressed by Gibbon.--M.]

[Footnote 21: The Caspian Sea, with its rivers and adjacent tribes,
are laboriously illustrated in the Examen Critique des Historiens
d'Alexandre, which compares the true geography, and the errors produced
by the vanity or ignorance of the Greeks.]

[Footnote 22: The original seat of the nation appears to have been in
the Northwest of China, in the provinces of Chensi and Chansi. Under the
two first dynasties, the principal town was still a movable camp; the
villages were thinly scattered; more land was employed in pasture than
in tillage; the exercise of hunting was ordained to clear the country
from wild beasts; Petcheli (where Pekin stands) was a desert, and the
Southern provinces were peopled with Indian savages. The dynasty of the
Han (before Christ 206) gave the empire its actual form and extent.]

[Footnote 23: The aera of the Chinese monarchy has been variously fixed
from 2952 to 2132 years before Christ; and the year 2637 has been chosen
for the lawful epoch, by the authority of the present emperor.
The difference arises from the uncertain duration of the two first
dynasties; and the vacant space that lies beyond them, as far as the
real, or fabulous, times of Fohi, or Hoangti. Sematsien dates his
authentic chronology from the year 841; the thirty-six eclipses of
Confucius (thirty-one of which have been verified) were observed between
the years 722 and 480 before Christ. The historical period of China does
not ascend above the Greek Olympiads.]

[Footnote 24: After several ages of anarchy and despotism, the dynasty
of the Han (before Christ 206) was the aera of the revival of learning.
The fragments of ancient literature were restored; the characters were
improved and fixed; and the future preservation of books was secured
by the useful inventions of ink, paper, and the art of printing.
Ninety-seven years before Christ, Sematsien published the first history
of China. His labors were illustrated, and continued, by a series of
one hundred and eighty historians. The substance of their works is still
extant; and the most considerable of them are now deposited in the king
of France's library.]

[Footnote 25: China has been illustrated by the labors of the French; of
the missionaries at Pekin, and Messrs. Freret and De Guignes at Paris.
