## Chapter XXXVI: Total Extinction Of The Western Empire.--Part V.

Whilst the vacant throne of Italy was abandoned to lawless Barbarians,
[112] the election of a new colleague was seriously agitated in the
council of Leo. The empress Verina, studious to promote the greatness
of her own family, had married one of her nieces to Julius Nepos, who
succeeded his uncle Marcellinus in the sovereignty of Dalmatia, a more
solid possession than the title which he was persuaded to accept, of
Emperor of the West. But the measures of the Byzantine court were so
languid and irresolute, that many months elapsed after the death of
Anthemius, and even of Olybrius, before their destined successor could
show himself, with a respectable force, to his Italian subjects. During
that interval, Glycerius, an obscure soldier, was invested with the
purple by his patron Gundobald; but the Burgundian prince was unable,
or unwilling, to support his nomination by a civil war: the pursuits of
domestic ambition recalled him beyond the Alps, [113] and his client
was permitted to exchange the Roman sceptre for the bishopric of
Salona. After extinguishing such a competitor, the emperor Nepos was
acknowledged by the senate, by the Italians, and by the provincials of
Gaul; his moral virtues, and military talents, were loudly celebrated;
and those who derived any private benefit from his government,
announced, in prophetic strains, the restoration of the public felicity.
[114] Their hopes (if such hopes had been entertained) were confounded
within the term of a single year, and the treaty of peace, which ceded
Auvergue to the Visigoths, is the only event of his short and inglorious
reign. The most faithful subjects of Gaul were sacrificed, by the
Italian emperor, to the hope of domestic security; [115] but his repose
was soon invaded by a furious sedition of the Barbarian confederates,
who, under the command of Orestes, their general, were in full march
from Rome to Ravenna. Nepos trembled at their approach; and, instead of
placing a just confidence in the strength of Ravenna, he hastily escaped
to his ships, and retired to his Dalmatian principality, on the opposite
coast of the Adriatic. By this shameful abdication, he protracted his
life about five years, in a very ambiguous state, between an emperor
and an exile, till he was assassinated at Salona by the ungrateful
Glycerius, who was translated, perhaps as the reward of his crime, to
the archbishopric of Milan. [116]

marked in Theophanes, (p. 102,) Jornandes, (c. 45, p. 679,) the
Chronicle of Marcellinus, and the Fragments of an anonymous writer,
published by Valesius at the end of Ammianus, (p. 716, 717.) If Photius
had not been so wretchedly concise, we should derive much information
from the contemporary histories of Malchus and Candidus. See his

Visigoths, for the purpose of ascertaining the fines Imperii Italici,
(Ennodius in Sirmond, tom. i. p. 1665-1669.) His pathetic discourse
concealed the disgraceful secret which soon excited the just and bitter
complaints of the bishop of Clermont.]

The nations who had asserted their independence after the death of
Attila, were established, by the right of possession or conquest, in
the boundless countries to the north of the Danube; or in the Roman
provinces between the river and the Alps. But the bravest of their youth
enlisted in the army of confederates, who formed the defence and the
terror of Italy; [117] and in this promiscuous multitude, the names
of the Heruli, the Scyrri, the Alani, the Turcilingi, and the Rugians,
appear to have predominated. The example of these warriors was imitated
by Orestes, [118] the son of Tatullus, and the father of the last Roman
emperor of the West. Orestes, who has been already mentioned in this
History, had never deserted his country. His birth and fortunes rendered
him one of the most illustrious subjects of Pannonia. When that province
was ceded to the Huns, he entered into the service of Attila, his lawful
sovereign, obtained the office of his secretary, and was repeatedly sent
ambassador to Constantinople, to represent the person, and signify the
commands, of the imperious monarch. The death of that conqueror restored
him to his freedom; and Orestes might honorably refuse either to follow
the sons of Attila into the Scythian desert, or to obey the Ostrogoths,
who had usurped the dominion of Pannonia. He preferred the service of
the Italian princes, the successors of Valentinian; and as he possessed
the qualifications of courage, industry, and experience, he advanced
with rapid steps in the military profession, till he was elevated,
by the favor of Nepos himself, to the dignities of patrician, and
master-general of the troops. These troops had been long accustomed to
reverence the character and authority of Orestes, who affected their
manners, conversed with them in their own language, and was intimately
connected with their national chieftains, by long habits of familiarity
and friendship. At his solicitation they rose in arms against the
obscure Greek, who presumed to claim their obedience; and when Orestes,
from some secret motive, declined the purple, they consented, with the
same facility, to acknowledge his son Augustulus as the emperor of the
West. By the abdication of Nepos, Orestes had now attained the summit of
his ambitious hopes; but he soon discovered, before the end of the first
year, that the lessons of perjury and ingratitude, which a rebel must
inculcate, will be resorted to against himself; and that the precarious
sovereign of Italy was only permitted to choose, whether he would be
the slave, or the victim, of his Barbarian mercenaries. The dangerous
alliance of these strangers had oppressed and insulted the last
remains of Roman freedom and dignity. At each revolution, their pay and
privileges were augmented; but their insolence increased in a still more
extravagant degree; they envied the fortune of their brethren in Gaul,
Spain, and Africa, whose victorious arms had acquired an independent
and perpetual inheritance; and they insisted on their peremptory demand,
that a third part of the lands of Italy should be immediately divided
among them. Orestes, with a spirit, which, in another situation, might
be entitled to our esteem, chose rather to encounter the rage of an
armed multitude, than to subscribe the ruin of an innocent people. He
rejected the audacious demand; and his refusal was favorable to the
ambition of Odoacer; a bold Barbarian, who assured his fellow-soldiers,
that, if they dared to associate under his command, they might soon
extort the justice which had been denied to their dutiful petitions.
From all the camps and garrisons of Italy, the confederates, actuated
by the same resentment and the same hopes, impatiently flocked to
the standard of this popular leader; and the unfortunate patrician,
overwhelmed by the torrent, hastily retreated to the strong city of
Pavia, the episcopal seat of the holy Epiphanites. Pavia was immediately
besieged, the fortifications were stormed, the town was pillaged; and
although the bishop might labor, with much zeal and some success, to
save the property of the church, and the chastity of female captives,
the tumult could only be appeased by the execution of Orestes. [119]
His brother Paul was slain in an action near Ravenna; and the helpless
Augustulus, who could no longer command the respect, was reduced to
implore the clemency, of Odoacer.

[Footnote 117: Our knowledge of these mercenaries, who subverted the
Western empire, is derived from Procopius, (de Bell. Gothico, l. i. c.
i. p. 308.) The popular opinion, and the recent historians, represent
Odoacer in the false light of a stranger, and a king, who invaded Italy
with an army of foreigners, his native subjects.]

[Footnote 118: Orestes, qui eo tempore quando Attila ad Italiam venit,
se illi unxit, ejus notarius factus fuerat. Anonym. Vales. p. 716. He
is mistaken in the date; but we may credit his assertion, that the
secretary of Attila was the father of Augustulus]

[Footnote 119: See Ennodius, (in Vit. Epiphan. Sirmond, tom. i. p. 1669,
1670.) He adds weight to the narrative of Procopius, though we may doubt
whether the devil actually contrived the siege of Pavia, to distress the
bishop and his flock.]

That successful Barbarian was the son of Edecon; who, in some remarkable
transactions, particularly described in a preceding chapter, had been
the colleague of Orestes himself. [1191] The honor of an ambassador
should be exempt from suspicion; and Edecon had listened to a conspiracy
against the life of his sovereign. But this apparent guilt was expiated
by his merit or repentance; his rank was eminent and conspicuous; he
enjoyed the favor of Attila; and the troops under his command, who
guarded, in their turn, the royal village, consisted of a tribe of
Scyrri, his immediate and hereditary subjects. In the revolt of the
nations, they still adhered to the Huns; and more than twelve years
afterwards, the name of Edecon is honorably mentioned, in their unequal
contests with the Ostrogoths; which was terminated, after two bloody
battles, by the defeat and dispersion of the Scyrri. [120] Their gallant
leader, who did not survive this national calamity, left two sons, Onulf
and Odoacer, to struggle with adversity, and to maintain as they might,
by rapine or service, the faithful followers of their exile. Onulf
directed his steps towards Constantinople, where he sullied, by the
assassination of a generous benefactor, the fame which he had acquired
in arms. His brother Odoacer led a wandering life among the Barbarians
of Noricum, with a mind and a fortune suited to the most desperate
adventures; and when he had fixed his choice, he piously visited the
cell of Severinus, the popular saint of the country, to solicit his
approbation and blessing. The lowness of the door would not admit the
lofty stature of Odoacer: he was obliged to stoop; but in that humble
attitude the saint could discern the symptoms of his future greatness;
and addressing him in a prophetic tone, "Pursue" (said he) "your design;
proceed to Italy; you will soon cast away this coarse garment of skins;
and your wealth will be adequate to the liberality of your mind." [121]
The Barbarian, whose daring spirit accepted and ratified the prediction,
was admitted into the service of the Western empire, and soon obtained
an honorable rank in the guards. His manners were gradually polished,
his military skill was improved, and the confederates of Italy would not
have elected him for their general, unless the exploits of Odoacer had
established a high opinion of his courage and capacity. [122] Their
military acclamations saluted him with the title of king; but he
abstained, during his whole reign, from the use of the purple and
diadem, [123] lest he should offend those princes, whose subjects, by
their accidental mixture, had formed the victorious army, which time and
policy might insensibly unite into a great nation.

[Footnote 1191: Manso observes that the evidence which identifies
Edecon, the father of Odoacer, with the colleague of Orestes, is not
conclusive. Geschichte des Ost-Gothischen Reiches, p. 32. But St. Martin
inclines to agree with Gibbon, note, vi. 75.--M.]

[Footnote 120: Jornandes, c. 53, 54, p. 692-695. M. de Buat (Hist. des
Peuples de l'Europe, tom. viii. p. 221-228) has clearly explained the
origin and adventures of Odoacer. I am almost inclined to believe that
he was the same who pillaged Angers, and commanded a fleet of Saxon
pirates on the ocean. Greg. Turon. l. ii. c. 18, in tom. ii. p. 170.
8 Note: According to St. Martin there is no foundation for this
conjecture, vii 5--M.]

[Footnote 121: Vade ad Italiam, vade vilissimis nunc pellibus coopertis:
sed multis cito plurima largiturus. Anonym. Vales. p. 717. He quotes the
life of St. Severinus, which is extant, and contains much unknown and
valuable history; it was composed by his disciple Eugippius (A.D. 511)
thirty years after his death. See Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom. xvi. p.
168-181.]

[Footnote 122: Theophanes, who calls him a Goth, affirms, that he was
educated, aursed in Italy, (p. 102;) and as this strong expression will
not bear a literal interpretation, it must be explained by long service
in the Imperial guards.]

[Footnote 123: Nomen regis Odoacer assumpsit, cum tamen neque purpura
nee regalibus uteretur insignibus. Cassiodor. in Chron. A.D. 476. He
seems to have assumed the abstract title of a king, without applying it
to any particular nation or country. 8 Note: Manso observes that Odoacer
never called himself king of Italy, assume the purple, and no coins are
extant with his name. Gescnichte Osi Goth. Reiches, p. 36--M.]

Royalty was familiar to the Barbarians, and the submissive people of
Italy was prepared to obey, without a murmur, the authority which he
should condescend to exercise as the vicegerent of the emperor of the
West. But Odoacer had resolved to abolish that useless and expensive
office; and such is the weight of antique prejudice, that it required
some boldness and penetration to discover the extreme facility of the
enterprise. The unfortunate Augustulus was made the instrument of his
own disgrace: he signified his resignation to the senate; and that
assembly, in their last act of obedience to a Roman prince, still
affected the spirit of freedom, and the forms of the constitution. An
epistle was addressed, by their unanimous decree, to the emperor Zeno,
the son-in-law and successor of Leo; who had lately been restored, after
a short rebellion, to the Byzantine throne. They solemnly "disclaim
the necessity, or even the wish, of continuing any longer the Imperial
succession in Italy; since, in their opinion, the majesty of a sole
monarch is sufficient to pervade and protect, at the same time, both
the East and the West. In their own name, and in the name of the people,
they consent that the seat of universal empire shall be transferred from
Rome to Constantinople; and they basely renounce the right of choosing
their master, the only vestige that yet remained of the authority which
had given laws to the world. The republic (they repeat that name without
a blush) might safely confide in the civil and military virtues of
Odoacer; and they humbly request, that the emperor would invest him with
the title of Patrician, and the administration of the diocese of Italy."
The deputies of the senate were received at Constantinople with some
marks of displeasure and indignation: and when they were admitted to the
audience of Zeno, he sternly reproached them with their treatment of
the two emperors, Anthemius and Nepos, whom the East had successively
granted to the prayers of Italy. "The first" (continued he) "you have
murdered; the second you have expelled; but the second is still alive,
and whilst he lives he is your lawful sovereign." But the prudent Zeno
soon deserted the hopeless cause of his abdicated colleague. His vanity
was gratified by the title of sole emperor, and by the statues erected
to his honor in the several quarters of Rome; he entertained a friendly,
though ambiguous, correspondence with the patrician Odoacer; and he
gratefully accepted the Imperial ensigns, the sacred ornaments of the
throne and palace, which the Barbarian was not unwilling to remove from
the sight of the people. [124]

[Footnote 124: Malchus, whose loss excites our regret, has preserved
(in Excerpt. Legat. p. 93) this extraordinary embassy from the senate to
Zeno. The anonymous fragment, (p. 717,) and the extract from Candidus,
(apud Phot. p. 176,) are likewise of some use.]

In the space of twenty years since the death of Valentinian, nine
emperors had successively disappeared; and the son of Orestes, a youth
recommended only by his beauty, would be the least entitled to the
notice of posterity, if his reign, which was marked by the extinction
of the Roman empire in the West, did not leave a memorable era in the
history of mankind. [125] The patrician Orestes had married the
daughter of Count Romulus, of Petovio in Noricum: the name of Augustus,
notwithstanding the jealousy of power, was known at Aquileia as a
familiar surname; and the appellations of the two great founders, of
the city and of the monarchy, were thus strangely united in the last
of their successors. [126] The son of Orestes assumed and disgraced the
names of Romulus Augustus; but the first was corrupted into Momyllus,
by the Greeks, and the second has been changed by the Latins into the
contemptible diminutive Augustulus. The life of this inoffensive youth
was spared by the generous clemency of Odoacer; who dismissed him, with
his whole family, from the Imperial palace, fixed his annual allowance
at six thousand pieces of gold, and assigned the castle of Lucullus, in
Campania, for the place of his exile or retirement. [127] As soon as the
Romans breathed from the toils of the Punic war, they were attracted by
the beauties and the pleasures of Campania; and the country-house of
the elder Scipio at Liternum exhibited a lasting model of their rustic
simplicity. [128] The delicious shores of the Bay of Naples were crowded
with villas; and Sylla applauded the masterly skill of his rival, who
had seated himself on the lofty promontory of Misenum, that commands, on
every side, the sea and land, as far as the boundaries of the horizon.
[129] The villa of Marius was purchased, within a few years, by
Lucullus, and the price had increased from two thousand five hundred, to
more than fourscore thousand, pounds sterling. [130] It was adorned
by the new proprietor with Grecian arts and Asiatic treasures; and the
houses and gardens of Lucullus obtained a distinguished rank in the list
of Imperial palaces. [131] When the Vandals became formidable to the
sea-coast, the Lucullan villa, on the promontory of Misenum, gradually
assumed the strength and appellation of a strong castle, the obscure
retreat of the last emperor of the West. About twenty years after that
great revolution, it was converted into a church and monastery, to
receive the bones of St. Severinus. They securely reposed, amidst the
the broken trophies of Cimbric and Armenian victories,till the beginning
of the tenth century; when the fortifications, which might afford a
dangerous shelter to the Saracens, were demolished by the people of
Naples. [132]

[Footnote 125: The precise year in which the Western empire was
extinguished, is not positively ascertained. The vulgar era of A.D. 476
appears to have the sanction of authentic chronicles. But the two dates
assigned by Jornandes (c. 46, p. 680) would delay that great event to
the year 479; and though M. de Buat has overlooked his evidence, he
produces (tom. viii. p. 261-288) many collateral circumstances in
support of the same opinion.]

[Footnote 126: See his medals in Ducange, (Fam. Byzantin. p. 81,)
Priscus, (Excerpt. Legat. p. 56,) Maffei, (Osservazioni Letterarie,
tom. ii p. 314.) We may allege a famous and similar case. The meanest
subjects of the Roman empire assumed the illustrious name of Patricius,
which, by the conversion of Ireland has been communicated to a whole
nation.]

[Footnote 127: Ingrediens autem Ravennam deposuit Augustulum de regno,
cujus infantiam misertus concessit ei sanguinem; et quia pulcher
erat, tamen donavit ei reditum sex millia solidos, et misit eum intra
Campaniam cum parentibus suis libere vivere. Anonym. Vales. p. 716.
Jornandes says, (c 46, p. 680,) in Lucullano Campaniae castello exilii
poena damnavit.]

[Footnote 128: See the eloquent Declamation of Seneca, (Epist. lxxxvi.)
The philosopher might have recollected, that all luxury is relative;
and that the elder Scipio, whose manners were polished by study
and conversation, was himself accused of that vice by his ruder
contemporaries, (Livy, xxix. 19.)]

[Footnote 129: Sylla, in the language of a soldier, praised his peritia
castrametandi, (Plin. Hist. Natur. xviii. 7.) Phaedrus, who makes its
shady walks (loeta viridia) the scene of an insipid fable, (ii. 5,) has
thus described the situation:--

     Caesar Tiberius quum petens Neapolim,
     In Misenensem villam venissit suam;
     Quae monte summo posita Luculli manu
     Prospectat Siculum et prospicit Tuscum mare.]

[Footnote 130: From seven myriads and a half to two hundred and fifty
myriads of drachmae. Yet even in the possession of Marius, it was
a luxurious retirement. The Romans derided his indolence; they soon
bewailed his activity. See Plutarch, in Mario, tom. ii. p. 524.]

[Footnote 131: Lucullus had other villa of equal, though various,
magnificence, at Baiae, Naples, Tusculum, &c., He boasted that he
changed his climate with the storks and cranes. Plutarch, in Lucull.
tom. iii. p. 193.]

[Footnote 132: Severinus died in Noricum, A.D. 482. Six years
afterwards, his body, which scattered miracles as it passed, was
transported by his disciples into Italy. The devotion of a Neapolitan
lady invited the saint to the Lucullan villa, in the place of
Augustulus, who was probably no more. See Baronius (Annal. Eccles. A.D.
496, No. 50, 51) and Tillemont, (Mem. Eccles. tom. xvi. p. 178-181,)
from the original life by Eugippius. The narrative of the last migration
of Severinus to Naples is likewise an authentic piece.]

Odoacer was the first Barbarian who reigned in Italy, over a people who
had once asserted their just superiority above the rest of mankind. The
disgrace of the Romans still excites our respectful compassion, and
we fondly sympathize with the imaginary grief and indignation of their
degenerate posterity. But the calamities of Italy had gradually subdued
the proud consciousness of freedom and glory. In the age of Roman virtue
the provinces were subject to the arms, and the citizens to the laws, of
the republic; till those laws were subverted by civil discord, and both
the city and the province became the servile property of a tyrant. The
forms of the constitution, which alleviated or disguised their abject
slavery, were abolished by time and violence; the Italians alternately
lamented the presence or the absence of the sovereign, whom they
detested or despised; and the succession of five centuries inflicted the
various evils of military license, capricious despotism, and elaborate
oppression. During the same period, the Barbarians had emerged from
obscurity and contempt, and the warriors of Germany and Scythia were
introduced into the provinces, as the servants, the allies, and at
length the masters, of the Romans, whom they insulted or protected. The
hatred of the people was suppressed by fear; they respected the spirit
and splendor of the martial chiefs who were invested with the honors of
the empire; and the fate of Rome had long depended on the sword of those
formidable strangers. The stern Ricimer, who trampled on the ruins of
Italy, had exercised the power, without assuming the title, of a king;
and the patient Romans were insensibly prepared to acknowledge the
royalty of Odoacer and his Barbaric successors. The king of Italy was
not unworthy of the high station to which his valor and fortune
had exalted him: his savage manners were polished by the habits of
conversation; and he respected, though a conqueror and a Barbarian,
the institutions, and even the prejudices, of his subjects. After an
interval of seven years, Odoacer restored the consulship of the West.
For himself, he modestly, or proudly, declined an honor which was
still accepted by the emperors of the East; but the curule chair was
successively filled by eleven of the most illustrious senators; [133]
and the list is adorned by the respectable name of Basilius, whose
virtues claimed the friendship and grateful applause of Sidonius, his
client. [134] The laws of the emperors were strictly enforced, and the
civil administration of Italy was still exercised by the Praetorian
praefect and his subordinate officers. Odoacer devolved on the Roman
magistrates the odious and oppressive task of collecting the public
revenue; but he reserved for himself the merit of seasonable and
popular indulgence. [135] Like the rest of the Barbarians, he had
been instructed in the Arian heresy; but he revered the monastic and
episcopal characters; and the silence of the Catholics attest the
toleration which they enjoyed. The peace of the city required the
interposition of his praefect Basilius in the choice of a Roman pontiff:
the decree which restrained the clergy from alienating their lands was
ultimately designed for the benefit of the people, whose devotions would
have been taxed to repair the dilapidations of the church. [136] Italy
was protected by the arms of its conqueror; and its frontiers were
respected by the Barbarians of Gaul and Germany, who had so long
insulted the feeble race of Theodosius. Odoacer passed the Adriatic, to
chastise the assassins of the emperor Nepos, and to acquire the maritime
province of Dalmatia. He passed the Alps, to rescue the remains of
Noricum from Fava, or Feletheus, king of the Rugians, who held his
residence beyond the Danube. The king was vanquished in battle, and
led away prisoner; a numerous colony of captives and subjects was
transplanted into Italy; and Rome, after a long period of defeat and
disgrace, might claim the triumph of her Barbarian master. [137]

[Footnote 133: The consular Fasti may be found in Pagi or Muratori. The
consuls named by Odoacer, or perhaps by the Roman senate, appear to have
been acknowledged in the Eastern empire.]

[Footnote 134: Sidonius Apollinaris (l. i. epist. 9, p. 22, edit.
Sirmond) has compared the two leading senators of his time, (A.D. 468,)
Gennadius Avienus and Caecina Basilius. To the former he assigns the
specious, to the latter the solid, virtues of public and private life. A
Basilius junior, possibly his son, was consul in the year 480.]

[Footnote 135: Epiphanius interceded for the people of Pavia; and the
king first granted an indulgence of five years, and afterwards relieved
them from the oppression of Pelagius, the Praetorian praefect, (Ennodius
in Vit St. Epiphan., in Sirmond, Oper. tom. i. p. 1670-1672.)]

[Footnote 136: See Baronius, Annal. Eccles. A.D. 483, No. 10-15. Sixteen
years afterwards the irregular proceedings of Basilius were condemned by
Pope Symmachus in a Roman synod.]

[Footnote 137: The wars of Odoacer are concisely mentioned by Paul the
Deacon, (de Gest. Langobard. l. i. c. 19, p. 757, edit. Grot.,) and
in the two Chronicles of Cassiodorus and Cuspinian. The life of St.
Severinus by Eugippius, which the count de Buat (Hist. des Peuples, &c.,
tom. viii. c. 1, 4, 8, 9) has diligently studied, illustrates the ruin
of Noricum and the Bavarian antiquities]

Notwithstanding the prudence and success of Odoacer, his kingdom
exhibited the sad prospect of misery and desolation. Since the age of
Tiberius, the decay of agriculture had been felt in Italy; and it was a
just subject of complaint, that the life of the Roman people depended
on the accidents of the winds and waves. [138] In the division and the
decline of the empire, the tributary harvests of Egypt and Africa were
withdrawn; the numbers of the inhabitants continually diminished
with the means of subsistence; and the country was exhausted by the
irretrievable losses of war, famine, [139] and pestilence. St. Ambrose
has deplored the ruin of a populous district, which had been once
adorned with the flourishing cities of Bologna, Modena, Regium, and
Placentia. [140] Pope Gelasius was a subject of Odoacer; and he affirms,
with strong exaggeration, that in Aemilia, Tuscany, and the adjacent
provinces, the human species was almost extirpated. [141] The plebeians
of Rome, who were fed by the hand of their master, perished or
disappeared, as soon as his liberality was suppressed; the decline of
the arts reduced the industrious mechanic to idleness and want; and the
senators, who might support with patience the ruin of their country,
bewailed their private loss of wealth and luxury. [1411] One third of
those ample estates, to which the ruin of Italy is originally imputed,
[142] was extorted for the use of the conquerors. Injuries were
aggravated by insults; the sense of actual sufferings was imbittered by
the fear of more dreadful evils; and as new lands were allotted to
the new swarms of Barbarians, each senator was apprehensive lest the
arbitrary surveyors should approach his favorite villa, or his most
profitable farm. The least unfortunate were those who submitted without
a murmur to the power which it was impossible to resist. Since they
desired to live, they owed some gratitude to the tyrant who had spared
their lives; and since he was the absolute master of their fortunes, the
portion which he left must be accepted as his pure and voluntary gift.
[143] The distress of Italy [1431] was mitigated by the prudence
and humanity of Odoacer, who had bound himself, as the price of
his elevation, to satisfy the demands of a licentious and turbulent
multitude. The kings of the Barbarians were frequently resisted,
deposed, or murdered, by their native subjects, and the various bands
of Italian mercenaries, who associated under the standard of an elective
general, claimed a larger privilege of freedom and rapine. A monarchy
destitute of national union, and hereditary right, hastened to its
dissolution. After a reign of fourteen years, Odoacer was oppressed by
the superior genius of Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths; a hero alike
excellent in the arts of war and of government, who restored an age
of peace and prosperity, and whose name still excites and deserves the
attention of mankind.

[Footnote 138: Tacit. Annal. iii. 53. The Recherches sur
l'Administration des Terres chez les Romains (p. 351-361) clearly state
the progress of internal decay.]

[Footnote 139: A famine, which afflicted Italy at the time of the
irruption of Odoacer, king of the Heruli, is eloquently described, in
prose and verse, by a French poet, (Les Mois, tom. ii. p. 174, 205,
edit. in 12 mo.) I am ignorant from whence he derives his information;
but I am well assured that he relates some facts incompatible with the

[Footnote 1411: Denina supposes that the Barbarians were compelled
by necessity to turn their attention to agriculture. Italy, either
imperfectly cultivated, or not at all, by the indolent or ruined
proprietors, not only could not furnish the imposts, on which the pay of
the soldiery depended, but not even a certain supply of the necessaries
of life. The neighboring countries were now occupied by warlike nations;
the supplies of corn from Africa were cut off; foreign commerce nearly
destroyed; they could not look for supplies beyond the limits of Italy,
throughout which the agriculture had been long in a state of progressive
but rapid depression. (Denina, Rev. d'Italia t. v. c. i.)--M.]

[Footnote 143: Such are the topics of consolation, or rather of
patience, which Cicero (ad Familiares, lib. ix. Epist. 17) suggests to
his friend Papirius Paetus, under the military despotism of Caesar.
The argument, however, of "vivere pulcherrimum duxi," is more forcibly
addressed to a Roman philosopher, who possessed the free alternative of
life or death]
