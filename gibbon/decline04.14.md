Our estimate of personal merit, is relative to the common faculties of
mankind. The aspiring efforts of genius, or virtue, either in active or
speculative life, are measured, not so much by their real elevation,
as by the height to which they ascend above the level of their age and
country; and the same stature, which in a people of giants would pass
unnoticed, must appear conspicuous in a race of pygmies. Leonidas, and
his three hundred companions, devoted their lives at Thermopylae; but
the education of the infant, the boy, and the man, had prepared,
and almost insured, this memorable sacrifice; and each Spartan would
approve, rather than admire, an act of duty, of which himself and eight
thousand of his fellow-citizens were equally capable. [1] The great
Pompey might inscribe on his trophies, that he had defeated in battle
two millions of enemies, and reduced fifteen hundred cities from the
Lake Maeotis to the Red Sea: [2] but the fortune of Rome flew before
his eagles; the nations were oppressed by their own fears, and the
invincible legions which he commanded, had been formed by the habits
of conquest and the discipline of ages. In this view, the character
of Belisarius may be deservedly placed above the heroes of the ancient
republics. His imperfections flowed from the contagion of the times; his
virtues were his own, the free gift of nature or reflection; he raised
himself without a master or a rival; and so inadequate were the arms
committed to his hand, that his sole advantage was derived from the
pride and presumption of his adversaries. Under his command, the
subjects of Justinian often deserved to be called Romans: but the
unwarlike appellation of Greeks was imposed as a term of reproach by the
haughty Goths; who affected to blush, that they must dispute the kingdom
of Italy with a nation of tragedians pantomimes, and pirates. [3] The
climate of Asia has indeed been found less congenial than that of Europe
to military spirit: those populous countries were enervated by luxury,
despotism, and superstition; and the monks were more expensive and more
numerous than the soldiers of the East. The regular force of the empire
had once amounted to six hundred and forty-five thousand men: it was
reduced, in the time of Justinian, to one hundred and fifty thousand;
and this number, large as it may seem, was thinly scattered over the sea
and land; in Spain and Italy, in Africa and Egypt, on the banks of
the Danube, the coast of the Euxine, and the frontiers of Persia. The
citizen was exhausted, yet the soldier was unpaid; his poverty was
mischievously soothed by the privilege of rapine and indolence; and
the tardy payments were detained and intercepted by the fraud of those
agents who usurp, without courage or danger, the emoluments of war.
Public and private distress recruited the armies of the state; but in
the field, and still more in the presence of the enemy, their numbers
were always defective. The want of national spirit was supplied by the
precarious faith and disorderly service of Barbarian mercenaries.

Even military honor, which has often survived the loss of virtue and
freedom, was almost totally extinct. The generals, who were multiplied
beyond the example of former times, labored only to prevent the success,
or to sully the reputation of their colleagues; and they had been taught
by experience, that if merit sometimes provoked the jealousy, error, or
even guilt, would obtain the indulgence, of a gracious emperor. [4] In
such an age, the triumphs of Belisarius, and afterwards of Narses, shine
with incomparable lustre; but they are encompassed with the darkest
shades of disgrace and calamity. While the lieutenant of Justinian
subdued the kingdoms of the Goths and Vandals, the emperor, [5] timid,
though ambitious, balanced the forces of the Barbarians, fomented their
divisions by flattery and falsehood, and invited by his patience and
liberality the repetition of injuries. [6] The keys of Carthage, Rome,
and Ravenna, were presented to their conqueror, while Antioch was
destroyed by the Persians, and Justinian trembled for the safety of
Constantinople.

[Footnote 1: It will be a pleasure, not a task, to read Herodotus, (l.
vii. c. 104, 134, p. 550, 615.) The conversation of Xerxes and Demaratus
at Thermopylae is one of the most interesting and moral scenes in
history. It was the torture of the royal Spartan to behold, with anguish
and remorse, the virtue of his country.]

[Footnote 2: See this proud inscription in Pliny, (Hist. Natur. vii.
27.) Few men have more exquisitely tasted of glory and disgrace;
nor could Juvenal (Satir. x.) produce a more striking example of the
vicissitudes of fortune, and the vanity of human wishes.]

[Footnote 3: This last epithet of Procopius is too nobly translated by
pirates; naval thieves is the proper word; strippers of garments, either
for injury or insult, (Demosthenes contra Conon Reiske, Orator, Graec.
tom. ii. p. 1264.)]

[Footnote 4: See the third and fourth books of the Gothic War: the
writer of the Anecdotes cannot aggravate these abuses.]

[Footnote 5: Agathias, l. v. p. 157, 158. He confines this weakness of
the emperor and the empire to the old age of Justinian; but alas! he was
never young.]

[Footnote 6: This mischievous policy, which Procopius (Anecdot. c. 19)
imputes to the emperor, is revealed in his epistle to a Scythian prince,
who was capable of understanding it.]

Even the Gothic victories of Belisarius were prejudicial to the state,
since they abolished the important barrier of the Upper Danube, which
had been so faithfully guarded by Theodoric and his daughter. For the
defence of Italy, the Goths evacuated Pannonia and Noricum, which
they left in a peaceful and flourishing condition: the sovereignty
was claimed by the emperor of the Romans; the actual possession was
abandoned to the boldness of the first invader. On the opposite banks of
the Danube, the plains of Upper Hungary and the Transylvanian hills were
possessed, since the death of Attila, by the tribes of the Gepidae,
who respected the Gothic arms, and despised, not indeed the gold of
the Romans, but the secret motive of their annual subsidies. The vacant
fortifications of the river were instantly occupied by these Barbarians;
their standards were planted on the walls of Sirmium and Belgrade; and
the ironical tone of their apology aggravated this insult on the majesty
of the empire. "So extensive, O Caesar, are your dominions, so numerous
are your cities, that you are continually seeking for nations to whom,
either in peace or in war, you may relinquish these useless possessions.
The Gepidae are your brave and faithful allies; and if they have
anticipated your gifts, they have shown a just confidence in your
bounty." Their presumption was excused by the mode of revenge which
Justinian embraced. Instead of asserting the rights of a sovereign for
the protection of his subjects, the emperor invited a strange people to
invade and possess the Roman provinces between the Danube and the Alps
and the ambition of the Gepidae was checked by the rising power and fame
of the Lombards. [7] This corrupt appellation has been diffused in the
thirteenth century by the merchants and bankers, the Italian posterity
of these savage warriors: but the original name of Langobards is
expressive only of the peculiar length and fashion of their beards. I am
not disposed either to question or to justify their Scandinavian origin;
[8] nor to pursue the migrations of the Lombards through unknown regions
and marvellous adventures. About the time of Augustus and Trajan, a ray
of historic light breaks on the darkness of their antiquities, and
they are discovered, for the first time, between the Elbe and the Oder.
Fierce, beyond the example of the Germans, they delighted to propagate
the tremendous belief, that their heads were formed like the heads
of dogs, and that they drank the blood of their enemies, whom they
vanquished in battle. The smallness of their numbers was recruited by
the adoption of their bravest slaves; and alone, amidst their powerful
neighbors, they defended by arms their high-spirited independence. In
the tempests of the north, which overwhelmed so many names and nations,
this little bark of the Lombards still floated on the surface: they
gradually descended towards the south and the Danube, and, at the end
of four hundred years, they again appear with their ancient valor and
renown. Their manners were not less ferocious. The assassination of a
royal guest was executed in the presence, and by the command, of the
king's daughter, who had been provoked by some words of insult, and
disappointed by his diminutive stature; and a tribute, the price of
blood, was imposed on the Lombards, by his brother the king of the
Heruli. Adversity revived a sense of moderation and justice, and the
insolence of conquest was chastised by the signal defeat and irreparable
dispersion of the Heruli, who were seated in the southern provinces
of Poland. [9] The victories of the Lombards recommended them to the
friendship of the emperors; and at the solicitations of Justinian, they
passed the Danube, to reduce, according to their treaty, the cities of
Noricum and the fortresses of Pannonia. But the spirit of rapine soon
tempted them beyond these ample limits; they wandered along the coast of
the Hadriatic as far as Dyrrachium, and presumed, with familiar rudeness
to enter the towns and houses of their Roman allies, and to seize the
captives who had escaped from their audacious hands. These acts
of hostility, the sallies, as it might be pretended, of some loose
adventurers, were disowned by the nation, and excused by the emperor;
but the arms of the Lombards were more seriously engaged by a contest
of thirty years, which was terminated only by the extirpation of the
Gepidae. The hostile nations often pleaded their cause before the throne
of Constantinople; and the crafty Justinian, to whom the Barbarians were
almost equally odious, pronounced a partial and ambiguous sentence, and
dexterously protracted the war by slow and ineffectual succors. Their
strength was formidable, since the Lombards, who sent into the field
several myriads of soldiers, still claimed, as the weaker side, the
protection of the Romans. Their spirit was intrepid; yet such is the
uncertainty of courage, that the two armies were suddenly struck with
a panic; they fled from each other, and the rival kings remained with
their guards in the midst of an empty plain. A short truce was obtained;
but their mutual resentment again kindled; and the remembrance of
their shame rendered the next encounter more desperate and bloody Forty
thousand of the Barbarians perished in the decisive battle, which broke
the power of the Gepidae, transferred the fears and wishes of Justinian,
and first displayed the character of Alboin, the youthful prince of the
Lombards, and the future conqueror of Italy. [10]

of the Lombards, (ii. 106.) Langobardos paucitas nobilitat. Plurimis
ac valentissimis nationibus cincti non per obsequium, sed praeliis et

Strabo, (l. viii. p. 446.) The best geographers place them beyond
the Elbe, in the bishopric of Magdeburgh and the middle march of
Brandenburgh; and their situation will agree with the patriotic remark
of the count de Hertzberg, that most of the Barbarian conquerors issued
from the same countries which still produce the armies of Prussia. *

defended by Grotius, (Prolegom. ad Hist. Goth. p. 28, &c.,) the Swedish
Ambassador.]

The wild people who dwelt or wandered in the plains of Russia,
Lithuania, and Poland, might be reduced, in the age of Justinian, under
the two great families of the Bulgarians [11] and the Sclavonians.
According to the Greek writers, the former, who touched the Euxine and
the Lake Maeotis, derived from the Huns their name or descent; and it is
needless to renew the simple and well-known picture of Tartar manners.
They were bold and dexterous archers, who drank the milk, and feasted
on the flesh, of their fleet and indefatigable horses; whose flocks and
herds followed, or rather guided, the motions of their roving camps;
to whose inroads no country was remote or impervious, and who were
practised in flight, though incapable of fear. The nation was divided
into two powerful and hostile tribes, who pursued each other with
fraternal hatred. They eagerly disputed the friendship, or rather the
gifts, of the emperor; and the distinctions which nature had fixed
between the faithful dog and the rapacious wolf was applied by an
ambassador who received only verbal instructions from the mouth of his
illiterate prince. [12] The Bulgarians, of whatsoever species, were
equally attracted by Roman wealth: they assumed a vague dominion over
the Sclavonian name, and their rapid marches could only be stopped by
the Baltic Sea, or the extreme cold and poverty of the north. But the
same race of Sclavonians appears to have maintained, in every age, the
possession of the same countries. Their numerous tribes, however distant
or adverse, used one common language, (it was harsh and irregular,) and
where known by the resemblance of their form, which deviated from the
swarthy Tartar, and approached without attaining the lofty stature and
fair complexion of the German. Four thousand six hundred villages [13]
were scattered over the provinces of Russia and Poland, and their huts
were hastily built of rough timber, in a country deficient both in stone
and iron. Erected, or rather concealed, in the depth of forests, on the
banks of rivers, or the edges of morasses, we may not perhaps, without
flattery, compare them to the architecture of the beaver; which they
resembled in a double issue, to the land and water, for the escape of
the savage inhabitant, an animal less cleanly, less diligent, and less
social, than that marvellous quadruped. The fertility of the soil,
rather than the labor of the natives, supplied the rustic plenty of the
Sclavonians. Their sheep and horned cattle were large and numerous, and
the fields which they sowed with millet or panic [14] afforded, in place
of bread, a coarse and less nutritive food. The incessant rapine of
their neighbors compelled them to bury this treasure in the earth; but
on the appearance of a stranger, it was freely imparted by a people,
whose unfavorable character is qualified by the epithets of chaste,
patient, and hospitable. As their supreme god, they adored an invisible
master of the thunder. The rivers and the nymphs obtained their
subordinate honors, and the popular worship was expressed in vows and
sacrifice. The Sclavonians disdained to obey a despot, a prince, or even
a magistrate; but their experience was too narrow, their passions too
headstrong, to compose a system of equal law or general defence. Some
voluntary respect was yielded to age and valor; but each tribe or
village existed as a separate republic, and all must be persuaded where
none could be compelled. They fought on foot, almost naked, and except
an unwieldy shield, without any defensive armor; their weapons of
offence were a bow, a quiver of small poisoned arrows, and a long rope,
which they dexterously threw from a distance, and entangled their enemy
in a running noose. In the field, the Sclavonian infantry was dangerous
by their speed, agility, and hardiness: they swam, they dived, they
remained under water, drawing their breath through a hollow cane; and
a river or lake was often the scene of their unsuspected ambuscade. But
these were the achievements of spies or stragglers; the military art was
unknown to the Sclavonians; their name was obscure, and their conquests
were inglorious. [15]

[Footnote 11: I adopt the appellation of Bulgarians from Ennodius, (in
Panegyr. Theodorici, Opp. Sirmond, tom. i. p. 1598, 1599,) Jornandes,
(de Rebus Geticis, c. 5, p. 194, et de Regn. Successione, p. 242,)
Theophanes, (p. 185,) and the Chronicles of Cassiodorus and Marcellinus.
The name of Huns is too vague; the tribes of the Cutturgurians and
Utturgurians are too minute and too harsh. * Note: The Bulgarians
are first mentioned among the writers of the West in the Panegyric on
Theodoric by Ennodius, Bishop of Pavia. Though they perhaps took part in
the conquests of the Huns, they did not advance to the Danube till
after the dismemberment of that monarchy on the death of Attila. But the
Bulgarians are mentioned much earlier by the Armenian writers. Above
600 years before Christ, a tribe of Bulgarians, driven from their native
possessions beyond the Caspian, occupied a part of Armenia, north of the
Araxes. They were of the Finnish race; part of the nation, in the fifth
century, moved westward, and reached the modern Bulgaria; part remained
along the Volga, which is called Etel, Etil, or Athil, in all the Tartar
languages, but from the Bulgarians, the Volga. The power of the eastern
Bulgarians was broken by Batou, son of Tchingiz Khan; that of the
western will appear in the course of the history. From St. Martin, vol.
vii p. 141. Malte-Brun, on the contrary, conceives that the Bulgarians
took their name from the river. According to the Byzantine historians
they were a branch of the Ougres, (Thunmann, Hist. of the People to
the East of Europe,) but they have more resemblance to the Turks. Their
first country, Great Bulgaria, was washed by the Volga. Some remains
of their capital are still shown near Kasan. They afterwards dwelt in
Kuban, and finally on the Danube, where they subdued (about the year
500) the Slavo-Servians established on the Lower Danube. Conquered in
their turn by the Avars, they freed themselves from that yoke in 635;
their empire then comprised the Cutturgurians, the remains of the Huns
established on the Palus Maeotis. The Danubian Bulgaria, a dismemberment
of this vast state, was long formidable to the Byzantine empire.
Malte-Brun, Prec. de Geog Univ. vol. i. p. 419.--M. ----According to
Shafarik, the Danubian Bulgaria was peopled by a Slavo Bulgarian race.
The Slavish population was conquered by the Bulgarian (of Uralian and
Finnish descent,) and incorporated with them. This mingled race are
the Bulgarians bordering on the Byzantine empire. Shafarik, ii 152, et
seq.--M. 1845]

[Footnote 12: Procopius, (Goth. l. iv. c. 19.) His verbal message (he
owns him self an illiterate Barbarian) is delivered as an epistle. The
style is savage, figurative, and original.]

[Footnote 13: This sum is the result of a particular list, in a curious
Ms. fragment of the year 550, found in the library of Milan. The obscure
geography of the times provokes and exercises the patience of the count
de Buat, (tom. xi. p. 69--189.) The French minister often loses himself
in a wilderness which requires a Saxon and Polish guide.]

modern husbandry, our millet feeds poultry, and not heroes. See the

[Footnote 15: For the name and nation, the situation and manners, of
the Sclavonians, see the original evidence of the vith century,
in Procopius, (Goth. l. ii. c. 26, l. iii. c. 14,) and the emperor
Mauritius or Maurice (Stratagemat. l. ii. c. 5, apud Mascon Annotat.
xxxi.) The stratagems of Maurice have been printed only, as I
understand, at the end of Scheffer's edition of Arrian's Tactics, at
Upsal, 1664, (Fabric. Bibliot. Graec. l. iv. c. 8, tom. iii. p. 278,) a
scarce, and hitherto, to me, an inaccessible book.]

I have marked the faint and general outline of the Sclavonians and
Bulgarians, without attempting to define their intermediate boundaries,
which were not accurately known or respected by the Barbarians
themselves. Their importance was measured by their vicinity to the
empire; and the level country of Moldavia and Wallachia was occupied
by the Antes, [16] a Sclavonian tribe, which swelled the titles of
Justinian with an epithet of conquest. [17] Against the Antes he erected
the fortifications of the Lower Danube; and labored to secure
the alliance of a people seated in the direct channel of northern
inundation, an interval of two hundred miles between the mountains
of Transylvania and the Euxine Sea. But the Antes wanted power and
inclination to stem the fury of the torrent; and the light-armed
Sclavonians, from a hundred tribes, pursued with almost equal speed the
footsteps of the Bulgarian horse. The payment of one piece of gold for
each soldier procured a safe and easy retreat through the country of the
Gepidae, who commanded the passage of the Upper Danube. [18] The hopes
or fears of the Barbarians; their intense union or discord; the accident
of a frozen or shallow stream; the prospect of harvest or vintage; the
prosperity or distress of the Romans; were the causes which produced the
uniform repetition of annual visits, [19] tedious in the narrative, and
destructive in the event. The same year, and possibly the same month,
in which Ravenna surrendered, was marked by an invasion of the Huns or
Bulgarians, so dreadful, that it almost effaced the memory of their past
inroads. They spread from the suburbs of Constantinople to the Ionian
Gulf, destroyed thirty-two cities or castles, erased Potidaea, which
Athens had built, and Philip had besieged, and repassed the Danube,
dragging at their horses' heels one hundred and twenty thousand of the
subjects of Justinian. In a subsequent inroad they pierced the wall
of the Thracian Chersonesus, extirpated the habitations and the
inhabitants, boldly traversed the Hellespont, and returned to their
companions, laden with the spoils of Asia. Another party, which seemed
a multitude in the eyes of the Romans, penetrated, without opposition,
from the Straits of Thermopylae to the Isthmus of Corinth; and the last
ruin of Greece has appeared an object too minute for the attention of
history. The works which the emperor raised for the protection, but at
the expense of his subjects, served only to disclose the weakness of
some neglected part; and the walls, which by flattery had been deemed
impregnable, were either deserted by the garrison, or scaled by
the Barbarians. Three thousand Sclavonians, who insolently divided
themselves into two bands, discovered the weakness and misery of a
triumphant reign. They passed the Danube and the Hebrus, vanquished the
Roman generals who dared to oppose their progress, and plundered, with
impunity, the cities of Illyricum and Thrace, each of which had arms and
numbers to overwhelm their contemptible assailants. Whatever praise the
boldness of the Sclavonians may deserve, it is sullied by the wanton
and deliberate cruelty which they are accused of exercising on their
prisoners. Without distinction of rank, or age, or sex, the captives
were impaled or flayed alive, or suspended between four posts, and
beaten with clubs till they expired, or enclosed in some spacious
building, and left to perish in the flames with the spoil and cattle
which might impede the march of these savage victors. [20] Perhaps
a more impartial narrative would reduce the number, and qualify the
nature, of these horrid acts; and they might sometimes be excused by the
cruel laws of retaliation. In the siege of Topirus, [21] whose obstinate
defence had enraged the Sclavonians, they massacred fifteen thousand
males; but they spared the women and children; the most valuable
captives were always reserved for labor or ransom; the servitude was not
rigorous, and the terms of their deliverance were speedy and moderate.
But the subject, or the historian of Justinian, exhaled his just
indignation in the language of complaint and reproach; and Procopius has
confidently affirmed, that in a reign of thirty-two years, each
annual inroad of the Barbarians consumed two hundred thousand of the
inhabitants of the Roman empire. The entire population of Turkish
Europe, which nearly corresponds with the provinces of Justinian, would
perhaps be incapable of supplying six millions of persons, the result of
this incredible estimate. [22]

by Procopius, (Goth. l. iii. c. 29, 38.) For their mild and liberal

more recent of the emperor Maurice, (Stratagem. l. ii. c. 5.)]

[Footnote 21: Topirus was situate near Philippi in Thrace, or Macedonia,

(c. 18,) these inroads had reduced the provinces south of the Danube to
the state of a Scythian wilderness.]

In the midst of these obscure calamities, Europe felt the shock of
revolution, which first revealed to the world the name and nation of the
Turks. [2211] Like Romulus, the founder [2212] of that martial people
was suckled by a she-wolf, who afterwards made him the father of a
numerous progeny; and the representation of that animal in the banners
of the Turks preserved the memory, or rather suggested the idea, of
a fable, which was invented, without any mutual intercourse, by the
shepherds of Latium and those of Scythia. At the equal distance of two
thousand miles from the Caspian, the Icy, the Chinese, and the Bengal
Seas, a ridge of mountains is conspicuous, the centre, and perhaps the
summit, of Asia; which, in the language of different nations, has been
styled Imaus, and Caf, [23] and Altai, and the Golden Mountains, [2311]
and the Girdle of the Earth. The sides of the hills were productive
of minerals; and the iron forges, [24] for the purpose of war, were
exercised by the Turks, the most despised portion of the slaves of the
great khan of the Geougen. But their servitude could only last till a
leader, bold and eloquent, should arise to persuade his countrymen that
the same arms which they forged for their masters, might become, in
their own hands, the instruments of freedom and victory. They sallied
from the mountains; [25] a sceptre was the reward of his advice; and the
annual ceremony, in which a piece of iron was heated in the fire, and
a smith's hammer [2511] was successively handled by the prince and his
nobles, recorded for ages the humble profession and rational pride of
the Turkish nation. Bertezena, [2512] their first leader, signalized
their valor and his own in successful combats against the neighboring
tribes; but when he presumed to ask in marriage the daughter of
the great khan, the insolent demand of a slave and a mechanic was
contemptuously rejected. The disgrace was expiated by a more noble
alliance with a princess of China; and the decisive battle which almost
extirpated the nation of the Geougen, established in Tartary the new and
more powerful empire of the Turks. [2513] They reigned over the north;
but they confessed the vanity of conquest, by their faithful attachment
to the mountain of their fathers. The royal encampment seldom lost sight
of Mount Altai, from whence the River Irtish descends to water the rich
pastures of the Calmucks, [26] which nourish the largest sheep and oxen
in the world. The soil is fruitful, and the climate mild and temperate:
the happy region was ignorant of earthquake and pestilence; the
emperor's throne was turned towards the East, and a golden wolf on the
top of a spear seemed to guard the entrance of his tent. One of the
successors of Bertezena was tempted by the luxury and superstition of
China; but his design of building cities and temples was defeated by the
simple wisdom of a Barbarian counsellor. "The Turks," he said, "are not
equal in number to one hundredth part of the inhabitants of China. If
we balance their power, and elude their armies, it is because we wander
without any fixed habitations in the exercise of war and hunting.
Are we strong? we advance and conquer: are we feeble? we retire and
are concealed. Should the Turks confine themselves within the walls of
cities, the loss of a battle would be the destruction of their empire.
The bonzes preach only patience, humility, and the renunciation of the
world. Such, O king! is not the religion of heroes." They entertained,
with less reluctance, the doctrines of Zoroaster; but the greatest part
of the nation acquiesced, without inquiry, in the opinions, or rather in
the practice, of their ancestors. The honors of sacrifice were
reserved for the supreme deity; they acknowledged, in rude hymns, their
obligations to the air, the fire, the water, and the earth; and their
priests derived some profit from the art of divination. Their unwritten
laws were rigorous and impartial: theft was punished with a tenfold
restitution; adultery, treason, and murder, with death; and no
chastisement could be inflicted too severe for the rare and inexpiable
guilt of cowardice. As the subject nations marched under the standard of
the Turks, their cavalry, both men and horses, were proudly computed
by millions; one of their effective armies consisted of four hundred
thousand soldiers, and in less than fifty years they were connected in
peace and war with the Romans, the Persians, and the Chinese. In
their northern limits, some vestige may be discovered of the form and
situation of Kamptchatka, of a people of hunters and fishermen, whose
sledges were drawn by dogs, and whose habitations were buried in the
earth. The Turks were ignorant of astronomy; but the observation taken
by some learned Chinese, with a gnomon of eight feet, fixes the royal
camp in the latitude of forty-nine degrees, and marks their extreme
progress within three, or at least ten degrees, of the polar circle.
[27] Among their southern conquests the most splendid was that of the
Nephthalites, or white Huns, a polite and warlike people, who possessed
the commercial cities of Bochara and Samarcand, who had vanquished the
Persian monarch, and carried their victorious arms along the banks, and
perhaps to the mouth, of the Indus. On the side of the West, the Turkish
cavalry advanced to the Lake Maeotis. They passed that lake on the ice.
The khan who dwelt at the foot of Mount Altai issued his commands for
the siege of Bosphorus, [28] a city the voluntary subject of Rome, and
whose princes had formerly been the friends of Athens. [29] To the east,
the Turks invaded China, as often as the vigor of the government was
relaxed: and I am taught to read in the history of the times, that
they mowed down their patient enemies like hemp or grass; and that
the mandarins applauded the wisdom of an emperor who repulsed these
Barbarians with golden lances. This extent of savage empire compelled
the Turkish monarch to establish three subordinate princes of his own
blood, who soon forgot their gratitude and allegiance. The conquerors
were enervated by luxury, which is always fatal except to an industrious
people; the policy of China solicited the vanquished nations to resume
their independence and the power of the Turks was limited to a period
of two hundred years. The revival of their name and dominion in the
southern countries of Asia are the events of a later age; and the
dynasties, which succeeded to their native realms, may sleep in
oblivion; since their history bears no relation to the decline and fall
of the Roman empire. [30]

[Footnote 2211: It must be remembered that the name of Turks is extended
to a whole family of the Asiatic races, and not confined to the Assena,
or Turks of the Altai.--M.]

[Footnote 2212: Assena (the wolf) was the name of this chief. Klaproth,
Tabl. Hist. de l'Asie p. 114.--M.]

[Footnote 23: From Caf to Caf; which a more rational geography would
interpret, from Imaus, perhaps, to Mount Atlas. According to the
religious philosophy of the Mahometans, the basis of Mount Caf is an
emerald, whose reflection produces the azure of the sky. The mountain
is endowed with a sensitive action in its roots or nerves; and
their vibration, at the command of God, is the cause of earthquakes.

[Footnote 24: The Siberian iron is the best and most plentiful in the
world; and in the southern parts, above sixty mines are now worked by
the industry of the Russians, (Strahlenberg, Hist. of Siberia, p. 342,
387. Voyage en Siberie, par l'Abbe Chappe d'Auteroche, p. 603--608,
edit in 12mo. Amsterdam. 1770.) The Turks offered iron for sale; yet the
Roman ambassadors, with strange obstinacy, persisted in believing that
it was all a trick, and that their country produced none, (Menander in
Excerpt. Leg. p. 152.)]

[Footnote 25: Of Irgana-kon, (Abulghazi Khan, Hist. Genealogique des
Tatars, P ii. c. 5, p. 71--77, c. 15, p. 155.) The tradition of the
Moguls, of the 450 years which they passed in the mountains, agrees with
the Chinese periods of the history of the Huns and Turks, (De Guignes,
tom. i. part ii. p. 376,) and the twenty generations, from their
restoration to Zingis.]

[Footnote 2511: The Mongol Temugin is also, though erroneously,
explained by Rubruquis, a smith. Schmidt, p 876.--M.]

[Footnote 2512: There appears the same confusion here. Bertezena
(Berte-Scheno) is claimed as the founder of the Mongol race. The name
means the gray (blauliche) wolf. In fact, the same tradition of the
origin from a wolf seems common to the Mongols and the Turks. The
Mongol Berte-Scheno, of the very curious Mongol History, published
and translated by M. Schmidt of Petersburg, is brought from Thibet. M.
Schmidt considers this tradition of the Thibetane descent of the royal
race of the Mongols to be much earlier than their conversion to Lamaism,
yet it seems very suspicious. See Klaproth, Tabl. de l'Asie, p. 159.
The Turkish Bertezena is called Thou-men by Klaproth, p. 115. In 552,
Thou-men took the title of Kha-Khan, and was called Il Khan.--M.]

[Footnote 2513: Great Bucharia is called Turkistan: see Hammer, 2. It
includes all the last steppes at the foot of the Altai. The name is the
same with that of the Turan of Persian poetic legend.--M.]

[Footnote 26: The country of the Turks, now of the Calmucks, is well
described in the Genealogical History, p. 521--562. The curious notes of
the French translator are enlarged and digested in the second volume of
the English version.]

belongs to a subordinate and successive tribe, may be introduced here.]

[Footnote 28: Procopius, Persic. l. i. c. 12, l. ii. c. 3. Peyssonel,
Observations sur les Peuples Barbares, p. 99, 100, defines the distance
between Caffa and the old Bosphorus at xvi. long Tartar leagues.]

[Footnote 29: See, in a Memoire of M. de Boze, (Mem. de l'Academie des
Inscriptions, tom. vi. p. 549--565,) the ancient kings and medals of
the Cimmerian Bosphorus; and the gratitude of Athens, in the Oration of
Demosthenes against Leptines, (in Reiske, Orator. Graec. tom. i. p. 466,
187.)]

[Footnote 30: For the origin and revolutions of the first Turkish
empire, the Chinese details are borrowed from De Guignes (Hist.
des Huns, tom. P. ii. p. 367--462) and Visdelou, (Supplement a la
Bibliotheque Orient. d'Herbelot, p. 82--114.) The Greek or Roman hints
are gathered in Menander (p. 108--164) and Theophylact Simocatta, (l.
vii. c. 7, 8.)]
