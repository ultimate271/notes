## Chapter LVI: The Saracens, The Franks And The Normans.--Part V.

A prince of such a temper could not be satisfied with having repelled
the insolence of a Barbarian. It was the right and duty, it might be
the interest and glory, of Manuel to restore the ancient majesty of the
empire, to recover the provinces of Italy and Sicily, and to chastise
this pretended king, the grandson of a Norman vassal. [112] The natives
of Calabria were still attached to the Greek language and worship, which
had been inexorably proscribed by the Latin clergy: after the loss of
her dukes, Apulia was chained as a servile appendage to the crown of
Sicily; the founder of the monarchy had ruled by the sword; and his
death had abated the fear, without healing the discontent, of his
subjects: the feudal government was always pregnant with the seeds of
rebellion; and a nephew of Roger himself invited the enemies of his
family and nation. The majesty of the purple, and a series of Hungarian
and Turkish wars, prevented Manuel from embarking his person in the
Italian expedition. To the brave and noble Palaeologus, his lieutenant,
the Greek monarch intrusted a fleet and army: the siege of Bari was his
first exploit; and, in every operation, gold as well as steel was the
instrument of victory. Salerno, and some places along the western
coast, maintained their fidelity to the Norman king; but he lost in
two campaigns the greater part of his continental possessions; and the
modest emperor, disdaining all flattery and falsehood, was content
with the reduction of three hundred cities or villages of Apulia and
Calabria, whose names and titles were inscribed on all the walls of
the palace. The prejudices of the Latins were gratified by a genuine or
fictitious donation under the seal of the German Caesars; [113] but
the successor of Constantine soon renounced this ignominious pretence,
claimed the indefeasible dominion of Italy, and professed his design of
chasing the Barbarians beyond the Alps. By the artful speeches, liberal
gifts, and unbounded promises, of their Eastern ally, the free cities
were encouraged to persevere in their generous struggle against the
despotism of Frederic Barbarossa: the walls of Milan were rebuilt by the
contributions of Manuel; and he poured, says the historian, a river
of gold into the bosom of Ancona, whose attachment to the Greeks was
fortified by the jealous enmity of the Venetians. [114] The situation
and trade of Ancona rendered it an important garrison in the heart
of Italy: it was twice besieged by the arms of Frederic; the imperial
forces were twice repulsed by the spirit of freedom; that spirit was
animated by the ambassador of Constantinople; and the most intrepid
patriots, the most faithful servants, were rewarded by the wealth and
honors of the Byzantine court. [115] The pride of Manuel disdained and
rejected a Barbarian colleague; his ambition was excited by the hope of
stripping the purple from the German usurpers, and of establishing,
in the West, as in the East, his lawful title of sole emperor of the
Romans. With this view, he solicited the alliance of the people and the
bishop of Rome. Several of the nobles embraced the cause of the Greek
monarch; the splendid nuptials of his niece with Odo Frangipani secured
the support of that powerful family, [116] and his royal standard or
image was entertained with due reverence in the ancient metropolis.
[117] During the quarrel between Frederic and Alexander the Third, the
pope twice received in the Vatican the ambassadors of Constantinople.
They flattered his piety by the long-promised union of the two churches,
tempted the avarice of his venal court, and exhorted the Roman pontiff
to seize the just provocation, the favorable moment, to humble
the savage insolence of the Alemanni and to acknowledge the true
representative of Constantine and Augustus. [118]

[Footnote 112: For the invasion of Italy, which is almost overlooked by
Nicetas see the more polite history of Cinnamus, (l. iv. c. 1-15, p.
78-101,) who introduces a diffuse narrative by a lofty profession, iii.
5.]

[Footnote 113: The Latin, Otho, (de Gestis Frederici I. l. ii. c. 30,
p. 734,) attests the forgery; the Greek, Cinnamus, (l. iv. c. 1, p.
78,) claims a promise of restitution from Conrad and Frederic. An act of
fraud is always credible when it is told of the Greeks.]

[Footnote 114: Quod Ancontiani Graecum imperium nimis diligerent ...
Veneti speciali odio Anconam oderunt. The cause of love, perhaps of
envy, were the beneficia, flumen aureum of the emperor; and the Latin
narrative is confirmed by Cinnamus, (l. iv. c. 14, p. 98.)]

[Footnote 115: Muratori mentions the two sieges of Ancona; the first,
in 1167, against Frederic I. in person (Annali, tom. x. p. 39, &c.;) the
second, in 1173, against his lieutenant Christian, archbishop of Mentz,
a man unworthy of his name and office, (p. 76, &c.) It is of the second
siege that we possess an original narrative, which he has published in
his great collection, (tom. vi. p. 921-946.)]

[Footnote 116: We derive this anecdote from an anonymous chronicle of
Fossa Nova, published by Muratori, (Script. Ital. tom. vii. p. 874.)]

[Footnote 117: Cinnamus (l. iv. c. 14, p. 99) is susceptible of this
double sense. A standard is more Latin, an image more Greek.]

[Footnote 118: Nihilominus quoque petebat, ut quia occasio justa et
tempos opportunum et acceptabile se obtulerant, Romani corona imperii a
sancto apostolo sibi redderetur; quoniam non ad Frederici Alemanni,
sed ad suum jus asseruit pertinere, (Vit. Alexandri III. a Cardinal.
Arragoniae, in Script. Rerum Ital. tom. iii. par. i. p. 458.) His second
embassy was accompanied cum immensa multitudine pecuniarum.]

But these Italian conquests, this universal reign, soon escaped from the
hand of the Greek emperor. His first demands were eluded by the
prudence of Alexander the Third, who paused on this deep and momentous
revolution; [119] nor could the pope be seduced by a personal dispute to
renounce the perpetual inheritance of the Latin name. After the reunion
with Frederic, he spoke a more peremptory language, confirmed the
acts of his predecessors, excommunicated the adherents of Manuel,
and pronounced the final separation of the churches, or at least the
empires, of Constantinople and Rome. [120] The free cities of Lombardy
no longer remembered their foreign benefactor, and without preserving
the friendship of Ancona, he soon incurred the enmity of Venice. [121]
By his own avarice, or the complaints of his subjects, the Greek emperor
was provoked to arrest the persons, and confiscate the effects, of the
Venetian merchants. This violation of the public faith exasperated a
free and commercial people: one hundred galleys were launched and armed
in as many days; they swept the coasts of Dalmatia and Greece: but after
some mutual wounds, the war was terminated by an agreement, inglorious
to the empire, insufficient for the republic; and a complete vengeance
of these and of fresh injuries was reserved for the succeeding
generation. The lieutenant of Manuel had informed his sovereign that he
was strong enough to quell any domestic revolt of Apulia and Calabria;
but that his forces were inadequate to resist the impending attack
of the king of Sicily. His prophecy was soon verified: the death of
Palaeologus devolved the command on several chiefs, alike eminent in
rank, alike defective in military talents; the Greeks were oppressed
by land and sea; and a captive remnant that escaped the swords of the
Normans and Saracens, abjured all future hostility against the person or
dominions of their conqueror. [122] Yet the king of Sicily esteemed the
courage and constancy of Manuel, who had landed a second army on the
Italian shore; he respectfully addressed the new Justinian; solicited a
peace or truce of thirty years, accepted as a gift the regal title; and
acknowledged himself the military vassal of the Roman empire. [123]
The Byzantine Caesars acquiesced in this shadow of dominion, without
expecting, perhaps without desiring, the service of a Norman army; and
the truce of thirty years was not disturbed by any hostilities between
Sicily and Constantinople. About the end of that period, the throne of
Manuel was usurped by an inhuman tyrant, who had deserved the abhorrence
of his country and mankind: the sword of William the Second, the
grandson of Roger, was drawn by a fugitive of the Comnenian race; and
the subjects of Andronicus might salute the strangers as friends,
since they detested their sovereign as the worst of enemies. The Latin
historians [124] expatiate on the rapid progress of the four counts
who invaded Romania with a fleet and army, and reduced many castles and
cities to the obedience of the king of Sicily. The Greeks [125] accuse
and magnify the wanton and sacrilegious cruelties that were perpetrated
in the sack of Thessalonica, the second city of the empire. The former
deplore the fate of those invincible but unsuspecting warriors who were
destroyed by the arts of a vanquished foe. The latter applaud, in songs
of triumph, the repeated victories of their countrymen on the Sea of
Marmora or Propontis, on the banks of the Strymon, and under the walls
of Durazzo. A revolution which punished the crimes of Andronicus,
had united against the Franks the zeal and courage of the successful
insurgents: ten thousand were slain in battle, and Isaac Angelus, the
new emperor, might indulge his vanity or vengeance in the treatment of
four thousand captives. Such was the event of the last contest between
the Greeks and Normans: before the expiration of twenty years, the rival
nations were lost or degraded in foreign servitude; and the successors
of Constantine did not long survive to insult the fall of the Sicilian
monarchy.

[Footnote 119: Nimis alta et perplexa sunt, (Vit. Alexandri III. p. 460,
461,) says the cautious pope.]

[Footnote 120: (Cinnamus, l. iv. c. 14, p. 99.)]

[Footnote 121: In his vith book, Cinnamus describes the Venetian war,
which Nicetas has not thought worthy of his attention. The Italian
accounts, which do not satisfy our curiosity, are reported by the
annalist Muratori, under the years 1171, &c.]

[Footnote 122: This victory is mentioned by Romuald of Salerno, (in
Muratori, Script. Ital. tom. vii. p. 198.) It is whimsical enough, that
in the praise of the king of Sicily, Cinnamus (l. iv. c. 13, p. 97, 98)
is much warmer and copious than Falcandus, (p. 268, 270.) But the Greek
is fond of description, and the Latin historian is not fond of William
the Bad.]

[Footnote 123: For the epistle of William I. see Cinnamus (l. iv. c.
15, p. 101, 102) and Nicetas, (l. ii. c. 8.) It is difficult to affirm,
whether these Greeks deceived themselves, or the public, in these
flattering portraits of the grandeur of the empire.]

[Footnote 124: I can only quote, of original evidence, the poor
chronicles of Sicard of Cremona, (p. 603,) and of Fossa Nova, (p. 875,)
as they are published in the viith tome of Muratori's historians.
The king of Sicily sent his troops contra nequitiam Andronici.... ad
acquirendum imperium C. P. They were.... decepti captique, by Isaac.]

[Footnote 125: By the failure of Cinnamus to Nicetas (in Andronico,
l.. c. 7, 8, 9, l. ii. c. 1, in Isaac Angelo, l. i. c. 1-4,) who now
becomes a respectable contemporary. As he survived the emperor and the
empire, he is above flattery; but the fall of Constantinople exasperated
his prejudices against the Latins. For the honor of learning I shall
observe that Homer's great commentator, Eustathias archbishop of
Thessalonica, refused to desert his flock.]

The sceptre of Roger successively devolved to his son and grandson:
they might be confounded under the name of William: they are strongly
discriminated by the epithets of the bad and the good; but these
epithets, which appear to describe the perfection of vice and virtue,
cannot strictly be applied to either of the Norman princes. When he was
roused to arms by danger and shame, the first William did not degenerate
from the valor of his race; but his temper was slothful; his manners
were dissolute; his passions headstrong and mischievous; and the monarch
is responsible, not only for his personal vices, but for those of Majo,
the great admiral, who abused the confidence, and conspired against the
life, of his benefactor. From the Arabian conquest, Sicily had imbibed a
deep tincture of Oriental manners; the despotism, the pomp, and even the
harem, of a sultan; and a Christian people was oppressed and insulted
by the ascendant of the eunuchs, who openly professed, or secretly
cherished, the religion of Mahomet. An eloquent historian of the times
[126] has delineated the misfortunes of his country: [127] the ambition
and fall of the ungrateful Majo; the revolt and punishment of his
assassins; the imprisonment and deliverance of the king himself; the
private feuds that arose from the public confusion; and the various
forms of calamity and discord which afflicted Palermo, the island, and
the continent, during the reign of William the First, and the minority
of his son. The youth, innocence, and beauty of William the Second,
[128] endeared him to the nation: the factions were reconciled; the
laws were revived; and from the manhood to the premature death of that
amiable prince, Sicily enjoyed a short season of peace, justice, and
happiness, whose value was enhanced by the remembrance of the past
and the dread of futurity. The legitimate male posterity of Tancred
of Hauteville was extinct in the person of the second William; but his
aunt, the daughter of Roger, had married the most powerful prince of the
age; and Henry the Sixth, the son of Frederic Barbarossa, descended from
the Alps to claim the Imperial crown and the inheritance of his wife.
Against the unanimous wish of a free people, this inheritance could only
be acquired by arms; and I am pleased to transcribe the style and sense
of the historian Falcandus, who writes at the moment, and on the spot,
with the feelings of a patriot, and the prophetic eye of a statesman.
"Constantia, the daughter of Sicily, nursed from her cradle in the
pleasures and plenty, and educated in the arts and manners, of this
fortunate isle, departed long since to enrich the Barbarians with our
treasures, and now returns, with her savage allies, to contaminate the
beauties of her venerable parent. Already I behold the swarms of angry
Barbarians: our opulent cities, the places flourishing in a long peace,
are shaken with fear, desolated by slaughter, consumed by rapine, and
polluted by intemperance and lust. I see the massacre or captivity
of our citizens, the rapes of our virgins and matrons. [129] In this
extremity (he interrogates a friend) how must the Sicilians act? By
the unanimous election of a king of valor and experience, Sicily
and Calabria might yet be preserved; [130] for in the levity of
the Apulians, ever eager for new revolutions, I can repose neither
confidence nor hope. [131] Should Calabria be lost, the lofty towers,
the numerous youth, and the naval strength, of Messina, [132] might
guard the passage against a foreign invader. If the savage Germans
coalesce with the pirates of Messina; if they destroy with fire the
fruitful region, so often wasted by the fires of Mount Aetna, [133] what
resource will be left for the interior parts of the island, these noble
cities which should never be violated by the hostile footsteps of a
Barbarian? [134] Catana has again been overwhelmed by an earthquake: the
ancient virtue of Syracuse expires in poverty and solitude; [135] but
Palermo is still crowned with a diadem, and her triple walls enclose the
active multitudes of Christians and Saracens. If the two nations,
under one king, can unite for their common safety, they may rush on
the Barbarians with invincible arms. But if the Saracens, fatigued by
a repetition of injuries, should now retire and rebel; if they should
occupy the castles of the mountains and sea-coast, the unfortunate
Christians, exposed to a double attack, and placed as it were between
the hammer and the anvil, must resign themselves to hopeless and
inevitable servitude." [136] We must not forget, that a priest here
prefers his country to his religion; and that the Moslems, whose
alliance he seeks, were still numerous and powerful in the state of
Sicily.

[Footnote 126: The Historia Sicula of Hugo Falcandus, which properly
extends from 1154 to 1169, is inserted in the viiith volume of
Muratori's Collection, (tom. vii. p. 259-344,) and preceded by a
eloquent preface or epistle, (p. 251-258, de Calamitatibus Siciliae.)
Falcandus has been styled the Tacitus of Sicily; and, after a just, but
immense, abatement, from the ist to the xiith century, from a senator to
a monk, I would not strip him of his title: his narrative is rapid and
perspicuous, his style bold and elegant, his observation keen; he had
studied mankind, and feels like a man. I can only regret the narrow and
barren field on which his labors have been cast.]

[Footnote 127: The laborious Benedictines (l'Art de verifier les Dates,
p. 896) are of opinion, that the true name of Falcandus is Fulcandus, or
Foucault. According to them, Hugues Foucalt, a Frenchman by birth,
and at length abbot of St. Denys, had followed into Sicily his patron
Stephen de la Perche, uncle to the mother of William II., archbishop of
Palermo, and great chancellor of the kingdom. Yet Falcandus has all the
feelings of a Sicilian; and the title of Alumnus (which he bestows on
himself) appears to indicate that he was born, or at least educated, in
the island.]

[Footnote 128: Falcand. p. 303. Richard de St. Germano begins his
history from the death and praises of William II. After some unmeaning
epithets, he thus continues: Legis et justitiae cultus tempore suo
vigebat in regno; sua erat quilibet sorte contentus; (were they
mortals?) abique pax, ubique securitas, nec latronum metuebat viator
insidias, nec maris nauta offendicula piratarum, (Script. Rerum Ital.
tom. vii p 939.)]

[Footnote 129: Constantia, primis a cunabulis in deliciarun tuarum
affluentia diutius educata, tuisque institutis, doctrinus et moribus
informata, tandem opibus tuis Barbaros delatura discessit: et nunc
cum imgentibus copiis revertitur, ut pulcherrima nutricis ornamenta
barbarica foeditate contaminet .... Intuari mihi jam videor turbulentas
bar barorum acies.... civitates opulentas et loca diuturna pace
florentia, metu concutere, caede vastare, rapinis atterere, et foedare
luxuria hinc cives aut gladiis intercepti, aut servitute depressi,
virgines constupratae, matronae, &c.]

[Footnote 130: Certe si regem non dubiae virtutis elegerint, nec a
Saracenis Christiani dissentiant, poterit rex creatus rebus licet quasi
desperatis et perditis subvenire, et incursus hostium, si prudenter
egerit, propulsare.]

[Footnote 131: In Apulis, qui, semper novitate gaudentes, novarum rerum
studiis aguntur, nihil arbitror spei aut fiduciae reponendum.]

[Footnote 132: Si civium tuorum virtutem et audaciam attendas, ....
muriorum etiam ambitum densis turribus circumseptum.]

[Footnote 133: Cum erudelitate piratica Theutonum confligat atrocitas,
et inter aucbustos lapides, et Aethnae flagrant's incendia, &c.]

[Footnote 134: Eam partem, quam nobilissimarum civitatum fulgor
illustrat, quae et toti regno singulari meruit privilegio praeminere,
nefarium esset.... vel barbarorum ingressu pollui. I wish to transcribe
his florid, but curious, description, of the palace, city, and luxuriant
plain of Palermo.]

[Footnote 135: Vires non suppetunt, et conatus tuos tam inopia civium,
quam paucitas bellatorum elidunt.]

[Footnote 136: The Normans and Sicilians appear to be confounded.]

The hopes, or at least the wishes, of Falcandus were at first gratified
by the free and unanimous election of Tancred, the grandson of the first
king, whose birth was illegitimate, but whose civil and military virtues
shone without a blemish. During four years, the term of his life and
reign, he stood in arms on the farthest verge of the Apulian frontier,
against the powers of Germany; and the restitution of a royal captive,
of Constantia herself, without injury or ransom, may appear to surpass
the most liberal measure of policy or reason. After his decease, the
kingdom of his widow and infant son fell without a struggle; and Henry
pursued his victorious march from Capua to Palermo. The political
balance of Italy was destroyed by his success; and if the pope and the
free cities had consulted their obvious and real interest, they would
have combined the powers of earth and heaven to prevent the dangerous
union of the German empire with the kingdom of Sicily. But the subtle
policy, for which the Vatican has so often been praised or arraigned,
was on this occasion blind and inactive; and if it were true that
Celestine the Third had kicked away the Imperial crown from the head
of the prostrate Henry, [137] such an act of impotent pride could serve
only to cancel an obligation and provoke an enemy. The Genoese, who
enjoyed a beneficial trade and establishment in Sicily, listened to the
promise of his boundless gratitude and speedy departure: [138] their
fleet commanded the straits of Messina, and opened the harbor of
Palermo; and the first act of his government was to abolish the
privileges, and to seize the property, of these imprudent allies. The
last hope of Falcandus was defeated by the discord of the Christians and
Mahometans: they fought in the capital; several thousands of the latter
were slain; but their surviving brethren fortified the mountains, and
disturbed above thirty years the peace of the island. By the policy of
Frederic the Second, sixty thousand Saracens were transplanted to Nocera
in Apulia. In their wars against the Roman church, the emperor and
his son Mainfroy were strengthened and disgraced by the service of the
enemies of Christ; and this national colony maintained their religion
and manners in the heart of Italy, till they were extirpated, at the
end of the thirteenth century, by the zeal and revenge of the house of
Anjou. [139] All the calamities which the prophetic orator had deplored
were surpassed by the cruelty and avarice of the German conqueror. He
violated the royal sepulchres, [1391] and explored the secret treasures
of the palace, Palermo, and the whole kingdom: the pearls and jewels,
however precious, might be easily removed; but one hundred and sixty
horses were laden with the gold and silver of Sicily. [140] The young
king, his mother and sisters, and the nobles of both sexes, were
separately confined in the fortresses of the Alps; and, on the slightest
rumor of rebellion, the captives were deprived of life, of their
eyes, or of the hope of posterity. Constantia herself was touched with
sympathy for the miseries of her country; and the heiress of the Norman
line might struggle to check her despotic husband, and to save the
patrimony of her new-born son, of an emperor so famous in the next age
under the name of Frederic the Second. Ten years after this revolution,
the French monarchs annexed to their crown the duchy of Normandy: the
sceptre of her ancient dukes had been transmitted, by a granddaughter of
William the Conqueror, to the house of Plantagenet; and the adventurous
Normans, who had raised so many trophies in France, England, and
Ireland, in Apulia, Sicily, and the East, were lost, either in victory
or servitude, among the vanquished nations.

[Footnote 137: The testimony of an Englishman, of Roger de Hoveden,
(p. 689,) will lightly weigh against the silence of German and Italian
history, (Muratori, Annali d' Italia, tom. x. p. 156.) The priests
and pilgrims, who returned from Rome, exalted, by every tale, the
omnipotence of the holy father.]

Muratori, (tom. x. p. 149, and A.D. 1223, 1247,) Giannone, (tom ii. p.
385,) and of the originals, in Muratori's Collection, Richard de St.
Germano, (tom. vii. p. 996,) Matteo Spinelli de Giovenazzo, (tom. vii.
p. 1064,) Nicholas de Jamsilla, (tom. x. p. 494,) and Matreo Villani,
(tom. xiv l. vii. p. 103.) The last of these insinuates that, in
reducing the Saracens of Nocera, Charles II. of Anjou employed rather
artifice than violence.]

[Footnote 1391: It is remarkable that at the same time the tombs of the
Roman emperors, even of Constantine himself, were violated and ransacked
by their degenerate successor Alexius Comnenus, in order to enable him
to pay the "German" tribute exacted by the menaces of the emperor Henry.
See the end of the first book of the Life of Alexius, in Nicetas, p.
632, edit.--M.]

[Footnote 140: Muratori quotes a passage from Arnold of Lubec, (l. iv.
c. 20:) Reperit thesauros absconditos, et omnem lapidum pretiosorum et
gemmarum gloriam, ita ut oneratis 160 somariis, gloriose ad terram suam
redierit. Roger de Hoveden, who mentions the violation of the royal
tombs and corpses, computes the spoil of Salerno at 200,000 ounces of
gold, (p. 746.) On these occasions, I am almost tempted to exclaim
with the listening maid in La Fontaine, "Je voudrois bien avoir ce qui
manque."]
