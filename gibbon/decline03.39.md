## Chapter XXXVII: Conversion Of The Barbarians To Christianity.--Part I.

     Origin Progress, And Effects Of The Monastic Life.--
     Conversion Of The Barbarians To Christianity And Arianism.--
     Persecution Of The Vandals In Africa.--Extinction Of
     Arianism Among The Barbarians.

The indissoluble connection of civil and ecclesiastical affairs has
compelled, and encouraged, me to relate the progress, the persecutions,
the establishment, the divisions, the final triumph, and the gradual
corruption, of Christianity. I have purposely delayed the consideration
of two religious events, interesting in the study of human nature,
and important in the decline and fall of the Roman empire. I. The
institution of the monastic life; [1] and, II. The conversion of the
northern Barbarians.

[Footnote 1: The origin of the monastic institution has been laboriously
discussed by Thomassin (Discipline de l'Eglise, tom. i. p. 1119-1426)
and Helyot, (Hist. des Ordres Monastiques, tom. i. p. 1-66.) These
authors are very learned, and tolerably honest, and their difference
of opinion shows the subject in its full extent. Yet the cautious
Protestant, who distrusts any popish guides, may consult the seventh
book of Bingham's Christian Antiquities.]

I. Prosperity and peace introduced the distinction of the vulgar and
the Ascetic Christians. [2] The loose and imperfect practice of religion
satisfied the conscience of the multitude. The prince or magistrate, the
soldier or merchant, reconciled their fervent zeal, and implicit faith,
with the exercise of their profession, the pursuit of their interest,
and the indulgence of their passions: but the Ascetics, who obeyed and
abused the rigid precepts of the gospel, were inspired by the savage
enthusiasm which represents man as a criminal, and God as a tyrant. They
seriously renounced the business, and the pleasures, of the age; abjured
the use of wine, of flesh, and of marriage; chastised their body,
mortified their affections, and embraced a life of misery, as the price
of eternal happiness. In the reign of Constantine, the Ascetics fled
from a profane and degenerate world, to perpetual solitude, or religious
society. Like the first Christians of Jerusalem, [3] [311] they resigned
the use, or the property of their temporal possessions; established
regular communities of the same sex, and a similar disposition; and
assumed the names of Hermits, Monks, and Anachorets, expressive of their
lonely retreat in a natural or artificial desert. They soon acquired the
respect of the world, which they despised; and the loudest applause was
bestowed on this Divine Philosophy, [4] which surpassed, without the aid
of science or reason, the laborious virtues of the Grecian schools. The
monks might indeed contend with the Stoics, in the contempt of fortune,
of pain, and of death: the Pythagorean silence and submission were
revived in their servile discipline; and they disdained, as firmly as
the Cynics themselves, all the forms and decencies of civil society. But
the votaries of this Divine Philosophy aspired to imitate a purer and
more perfect model. They trod in the footsteps of the prophets, who
had retired to the desert; [5] and they restored the devout and
contemplative life, which had been instituted by the Essenians, in
Palestine and Egypt. The philosophic eye of Pliny had surveyed with
astonishment a solitary people, who dwelt among the palm-trees near
the Dead Sea; who subsisted without money, who were propagated without
women; and who derived from the disgust and repentance of mankind a
perpetual supply of voluntary associates. [6]

[Footnote 2: See Euseb. Demonstrat. Evangel., (l. i. p. 20, 21, edit.
Graec. Rob. Stephani, Paris, 1545.) In his Ecclesiastical History,
published twelve years after the Demonstration, Eusebius (l. ii. c. 17)
asserts the Christianity of the Therapeutae; but he appears ignorant
that a similar institution was actually revived in Egypt.]

[Footnote 3: Cassian (Collat. xviii. 5.) claims this origin for the
institution of the Coenobites, which gradually decayed till it was
restored by Antony and his disciples.]

[Footnote 311: It has before been shown that the first Christian
community was not strictly coenobitic. See vol. ii.--M.]

[Footnote 4: These are the expressive words of Sozomen, who copiously
and agreeably describes (l. i. c. 12, 13, 14) the origin and progress
of this monkish philosophy, (see Suicer. Thesau, Eccles., tom. ii.
p. 1441.) Some modern writers, Lipsius (tom. iv. p. 448. Manuduct. ad
Philosoph. Stoic. iii. 13) and La Mothe le Vayer, (tom. ix. de la
Vertu des Payens, p. 228-262,) have compared the Carmelites to the
Pythagoreans, and the Cynics to the Capucins.]

[Footnote 5: The Carmelites derive their pedigree, in regular
succession, from the prophet Elijah, (see the Theses of Beziers, A.D.
1682, in Bayle's Nouvelles de la Republique des Lettres, Oeuvres,
tom. i. p. 82, &c., and the prolix irony of the Ordres Monastiques,
an anonymous work, tom. i. p. 1-433, Berlin, 1751.) Rome, and the
inquisition of Spain, silenced the profane criticism of the Jesuits of
Flanders, (Helyot, Hist. des Ordres Monastiques, tom. i. p. 282-300,)
and the statue of Elijah, the Carmelite, has been erected in the church
of St. Peter, (Voyages du P. Labat tom. iii. p. 87.)]

[Footnote 6: Plin. Hist. Natur. v. 15. Gens sola, et in toto orbe
praeter ceteras mira, sine ulla femina, omni venere abdicata, sine
pecunia, socia palmarum. Ita per seculorum millia (incredibile dictu)
gens aeterna est in qua nemo nascitur. Tam foecunda illis aliorum vitae
poenitentia est. He places them just beyond the noxious influence of the
lake, and names Engaddi and Massada as the nearest towns. The Laura, and
monastery of St. Sabas, could not be far distant from this place. See
Reland. Palestin., tom. i. p. 295; tom. ii. p. 763, 874, 880, 890.]

Egypt, the fruitful parent of superstition, afforded the first example
of the monastic life. Antony, [7] an illiterate [8] youth of the lower
parts of Thebais, distributed his patrimony, [9] deserted his family
and native home, and executed his monastic penance with original and
intrepid fanaticism. After a long and painful novitiate, among the
tombs, and in a ruined tower, he boldly advanced into the desert three
days' journey to the eastward of the Nile; discovered a lonely spot,
which possessed the advantages of shade and water, and fixed his last
residence on Mount Colzim, near the Red Sea; where an ancient monastery
still preserves the name and memory of the saint. [10] The curious
devotion of the Christians pursued him to the desert; and when he was
obliged to appear at Alexandria, in the face of mankind, he supported
his fame with discretion and dignity. He enjoyed the friendship of
Athanasius, whose doctrine he approved; and the Egyptian peasant
respectfully declined a respectful invitation from the emperor
Constantine. The venerable patriarch (for Antony attained the age of
one hundred and five years) beheld the numerous progeny which had been
formed by his example and his lessons. The prolific colonies of monks
multiplied with rapid increase on the sands of Libya, upon the rocks of
Thebais, and in the cities of the Nile. To the south of Alexandria, the
mountain, and adjacent desert, of Nitria, were peopled by five thousand
anachorets; and the traveller may still investigate the ruins of fifty
monasteries, which were planted in that barren soil by the disciples of
Antony. [11] In the Upper Thebais, the vacant island of Tabenne, [12]
was occupied by Pachomius and fourteen hundred of his brethren. That
holy abbot successively founded nine monasteries of men, and one of
women; and the festival of Easter sometimes collected fifty thousand
religious persons, who followed his angelic rule of discipline. [13]
The stately and populous city of Oxyrinchus, the seat of Christian
orthodoxy, had devoted the temples, the public edifices, and even the
ramparts, to pious and charitable uses; and the bishop, who might preach
in twelve churches, computed ten thousand females and twenty thousand
males, of the monastic profession. [14] The Egyptians, who gloried in
this marvellous revolution, were disposed to hope, and to believe, that
the number of the monks was equal to the remainder of the people; [15]
and posterity might repeat the saying, which had formerly been applied
to the sacred animals of the same country, That in Egypt it was less
difficult to find a god than a man.

[Footnote 7: See Athanas. Op. tom. ii. p. 450-505, and the Vit. Patrum,
p. 26-74, with Rosweyde's Annotations. The former is the Greek original
the latter, a very ancient Latin version by Evagrius, the friend of St.
Jerom.]

[Footnote 8: Athanas. tom. ii. in Vit. St. Anton. p. 452; and the
assertion of his total ignorance has been received by many of the
ancients and moderns. But Tillemont (Mem. Eccles. tom. vii. p. 666)
shows, by some probable arguments, that Antony could read and write in
the Coptic, his native tongue; and that he was only a stranger to the
Greek letters. The philosopher Synesius (p. 51) acknowledges that the
natural genius of Antony did not require the aid of learning.]

[Footnote 9: Aruroe autem erant ei trecentae uberes, et valde optimae,
(Vit. Patr. l. v. p. 36.) If the Arura be a square measure, of a hundred
Egyptian cubits, (Rosweyde, Onomasticon ad Vit. Patrum, p. 1014, 1015,)
and the Egyptian cubit of all ages be equal to twenty-two English
inches, (Greaves, vol. i. p. 233,) the arura will consist of about three
quarters of an English acre.]

[Footnote 10: The description of the monastery is given by Jerom (tom.
i. p. 248, 249, in Vit. Hilarion) and the P. Sicard, (Missions du Levant
tom. v. p. 122-200.) Their accounts cannot always be reconciled the
father painted from his fancy, and the Jesuit from his experience.]

[Footnote 11: Jerom, tom. i. p. 146, ad Eustochium. Hist. Lausiac. c. 7,
in Vit. Patrum, p. 712. The P. Sicard (Missions du Levant, tom. ii. p.
29-79) visited and has described this desert, which now contains four
monasteries, and twenty or thirty monks. See D'Anville, Description de
l'Egypte, p. 74.]

[Footnote 12: Tabenne is a small island in the Nile, in the diocese of
Tentyra or Dendera, between the modern town of Girge and the ruins of
ancient Thebes, (D'Anville, p. 194.) M. de Tillemont doubts whether it
was an isle; but I may conclude, from his own facts, that the primitive
name was afterwards transferred to the great monastery of Bau or Pabau,
(Mem. Eccles. tom. vii. p. 678, 688.)]

[Footnote 13: See in the Codex Regularum (published by Lucas Holstenius,
Rome, 1661) a preface of St. Jerom to his Latin version of the Rule of
Pachomius, tom. i. p. 61.]

[Footnote 14: Rufin. c. 5, in Vit. Patrum, p. 459. He calls it civitas
ampla ralde et populosa, and reckons twelve churches. Strabo (l.
xvii. p. 1166) and Ammianus (xxii. 16) have made honorable mention
of Oxyrinchus, whose inhabitants adored a small fish in a magnificent
temple.]

[Footnote 15: Quanti populi habentur in urbibus, tantae paene habentur
in desertis multitudines monachorum. Rufin. c. 7, in Vit. Patrum, p.
461. He congratulates the fortunate change.]

Athanasius introduced into Rome the knowledge and practice of the
monastic life; and a school of this new philosophy was opened by the
disciples of Antony, who accompanied their primate to the holy threshold
of the Vatican. The strange and savage appearance of these Egyptians
excited, at first, horror and contempt, and, at length, applause and
zealous imitation. The senators, and more especially the matrons,
transformed their palaces and villas into religious houses; and
the narrow institution of six vestals was eclipsed by the frequent
monasteries, which were seated on the ruins of ancient temples, and in
the midst of the Roman forum. [16] Inflamed by the example of Antony, a
Syrian youth, whose name was Hilarion, [17] fixed his dreary abode on a
sandy beach, between the sea and a morass, about seven miles from Gaza.
The austere penance, in which he persisted forty-eight years, diffused
a similar enthusiasm; and the holy man was followed by a train of two
or three thousand anachorets, whenever he visited the innumerable
monasteries of Palestine. The fame of Basil [18] is immortal in the
monastic history of the East. With a mind that had tasted the learning
and eloquence of Athens; with an ambition scarcely to be satisfied with
the archbishopric of Caesarea, Basil retired to a savage solitude in
Pontus; and deigned, for a while, to give laws to the spiritual colonies
which he profusely scattered along the coast of the Black Sea. In the
West, Martin of Tours, [19] a soldier, a hermit, a bishop, and a saint,
established the monasteries of Gaul; two thousand of his disciples
followed him to the grave; and his eloquent historian challenges the
deserts of Thebais to produce, in a more favorable climate, a champion
of equal virtue. The progress of the monks was not less rapid, or
universal, than that of Christianity itself. Every province, and,
at last, every city, of the empire, was filled with their increasing
multitudes; and the bleak and barren isles, from Lerins to Lipari, that
arose out of the Tuscan Sea, were chosen by the anachorets for the place
of their voluntary exile. An easy and perpetual intercourse by sea
and land connected the provinces of the Roman world; and the life
of Hilarion displays the facility with which an indigent hermit of
Palestine might traverse Egypt, embark for Sicily, escape to Epirus,
and finally settle in the Island of Cyprus. [20] The Latin Christians
embraced the religious institutions of Rome. The pilgrims, who visited
Jerusalem, eagerly copied, in the most distant climates of the earth,
the faithful model of the monastic life. The disciples of Antony spread
themselves beyond the tropic, over the Christian empire of Aethiopia.
[21] The monastery of Banchor, [22] in Flintshire, which contained above
two thousand brethren, dispersed a numerous colony among the Barbarians
of Ireland; [23] and Iona, one of the Hebrides, which was planted by
the Irish monks, diffused over the northern regions a doubtful ray of
science and superstition. [24]

[Footnote 16: The introduction of the monastic life into Rome and Italy
is occasionally mentioned by Jerom, tom. i. p. 119, 120, 199.]

[Footnote 17: See the Life of Hilarion, by St. Jerom, (tom. i. p. 241,
252.) The stories of Paul, Hilarion, and Malchus, by the same author,
are admirably told: and the only defect of these pleasing compositions
is the want of truth and common sense.]

[Footnote 18: His original retreat was in a small village on the banks
of the Iris, not far from Neo-Caesarea. The ten or twelve years of
his monastic life were disturbed by long and frequent avocations. Some
critics have disputed the authenticity of his Ascetic rules; but the
external evidence is weighty, and they can only prove that it is the
work of a real or affected enthusiast. See Tillemont, Mem. Eccles tom.
ix. p. 636-644. Helyot, Hist. des Ordres Monastiques tom. i. p. 175-181]

[Footnote 19: See his Life, and the three Dialogues by Sulpicius
Severus, who asserts (Dialog. i. 16) that the booksellers of Rome were
delighted with the quick and ready sale of his popular work.]

[Footnote 20: When Hilarion sailed from Paraetonium to Cape Pachynus,
he offered to pay his passage with a book of the Gospels. Posthumian,
a Gallic monk, who had visited Egypt, found a merchant ship bound from
Alexandria to Marseilles, and performed the voyage in thirty days,
(Sulp. Sever. Dialog. i. 1.) Athanasius, who addressed his Life of St.
Antony to the foreign monks, was obliged to hasten the composition, that
it might be ready for the sailing of the fleets, (tom. ii. p. 451.)]

[Footnote 21: See Jerom, (tom. i. p. 126,) Assemanni, Bibliot. Orient.
tom. iv. p. 92, p. 857-919, and Geddes, Church History of Aethiopia,
p. 29-31. The Abyssinian monks adhere very strictly to the primitive
institution.]

[Footnote 22: Camden's Britannia, vol. i. p. 666, 667.]

[Footnote 23: All that learning can extract from the rubbish of the
dark ages is copiously stated by Archbishop Usher in his Britannicarum
Ecclesiarum Antiquitates, cap. xvi. p. 425-503.]

[Footnote 24: This small, though not barren, spot, Iona, Hy, or
Columbkill, only two miles in length, aud one mile in breadth, has been
distinguished, 1. By the monastery of St. Columba, founded A.D. 566;
whose abbot exercised an extraordinary jurisdiction over the bishops
of Caledonia; 2. By a classic library, which afforded some hopes of
an entire Livy; and, 3. By the tombs of sixty kings, Scots, Irish, and
Norwegians, who reposed in holy ground. See Usher (p. 311, 360-370) and
Buchanan, (Rer. Scot. l. ii. p. 15, edit. Ruddiman.)]

These unhappy exiles from social life were impelled by the dark and
implacable genius of superstition. Their mutual resolution was supported
by the example of millions, of either sex, of every age, and of every
rank; and each proselyte who entered the gates of a monastery, was
persuaded that he trod the steep and thorny path of eternal happiness.
[25] But the operation of these religious motives was variously
determined by the temper and situation of mankind. Reason might subdue,
or passion might suspend, their influence: but they acted most forcibly
on the infirm minds of children and females; they were strengthened by
secret remorse, or accidental misfortune; and they might derive some aid
from the temporal considerations of vanity or interest. It was naturally
supposed, that the pious and humble monks, who had renounced the world
to accomplish the work of their salvation, were the best qualified for
the spiritual government of the Christians. The reluctant hermit was
torn from his cell, and seated, amidst the acclamations of the people,
on the episcopal throne: the monasteries of Egypt, of Gaul, and of the
East, supplied a regular succession of saints and bishops; and ambition
soon discovered the secret road which led to the possession of wealth
and honors. [26] The popular monks, whose reputation was connected with
the fame and success of the order, assiduously labored to multiply the
number of their fellow-captives. They insinuated themselves into noble
and opulent families; and the specious arts of flattery and seduction
were employed to secure those proselytes who might bestow wealth or
dignity on the monastic profession. The indignant father bewailed the
loss, perhaps, of an only son; [27] the credulous maid was betrayed
by vanity to violate the laws of nature; and the matron aspired to
imaginary perfection, by renouncing the virtues of domestic life. Paula
yielded to the persuasive eloquence of Jerom; [28] and the profane
title of mother-in-law of God [29] tempted that illustrious widow to
consecrate the virginity of her daughter Eustochium. By the advice, and
in the company, of her spiritual guide, Paula abandoned Rome and her
infant son; retired to the holy village of Bethlem; founded a hospital
and four monasteries; and acquired, by her alms and penance, an
eminent and conspicuous station in the Catholic church. Such rare and
illustrious penitents were celebrated as the glory and example of their
age; but the monasteries were filled by a crowd of obscure and abject
plebeians, [30] who gained in the cloister much more than they had
sacrificed in the world. Peasants, slaves, and mechanics, might escape
from poverty and contempt to a safe and honorable profession; whose
apparent hardships are mitigated by custom, by popular applause, and by
the secret relaxation of discipline. [31] The subjects of Rome, whose
persons and fortunes were made responsible for unequal and exorbitant
tributes, retired from the oppression of the Imperial government; and
the pusillanimous youth preferred the penance of a monastic, to the
dangers of a military, life. The affrighted provincials of every rank,
who fled before the Barbarians, found shelter and subsistence: whole
legions were buried in these religious sanctuaries; and the same cause,
which relieved the distress of individuals, impaired the strength and
fortitude of the empire. [32]

[Footnote 25: Chrysostom (in the first tome of the Benedictine edition)
has consecrated three books to the praise and defence of the monastic
life. He is encouraged, by the example of the ark, to presume that
none but the elect (the monks) can possibly be saved (l. i. p. 55, 56.)
Elsewhere, indeed, he becomes more merciful, (l. iii. p. 83, 84,) and
allows different degrees of glory, like the sun, moon, and stars. In
his lively comparison of a king and a monk, (l. iii. p. 116-121,) he
supposes (what is hardly fair) that the king will be more sparingly
rewarded, and more rigorously punished.]

[Footnote 26: Thomassin (Discipline de l'Eglise tom. i. p. 1426-1469)
and Mabillon, (Oeuvres Posthumes, tom. ii. p. 115-158.) The monks were
gradually adopted as a part of the ecclesiastical hierarchy.]

[Footnote 27: Dr. Middleton (vol. i. p. 110) liberally censures the
conduct and writings of Chrysostom, one of the most eloquent and
successful advocates for the monastic life.]

[Footnote 28: Jerom's devout ladies form a very considerable portion
of his works: the particular treatise, which he styles the Epitaph of
Paula, (tom. i. p. 169-192,) is an elaborate and extravagant panegyric.
The exordium is ridiculously turgid: "If all the members of my body were
changed into tongues, and if all my limbs resounded with a human voice,
yet should I be incapable," &c.]

[Footnote 29: Socrus Dei esse coepisti, (Jerom, tom. i. p. 140, ad
Eustochium.) Rufinus, (in Hieronym. Op. tom. iv. p. 223,) who was justly
scandalized, asks his adversary, from what Pagan poet he had stolen an
expression so impious and absurd.]

[Footnote 30: Nunc autem veniunt plerumque ad hanc professionem
servitutis Dei, et ex conditione servili, vel etiam liberati, vel
propter hoc a Dominis liberati sive liberandi; et ex vita rusticana et
ex opificum exercitatione, et plebeio labore. Augustin, de Oper. Monach.
c. 22, ap. Thomassin, Discipline de l'Eglise, tom. iii. p. 1094. The
Egyptian, who blamed Arsenius, owned that he led a more comfortable life
as a monk than as a shepherd. See Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom. xiv. p.
679.]

[Footnote 31: A Dominican friar, (Voyages du P. Labat, tom. i. p. 10,)
who lodged at Cadiz in a convent of his brethren, soon understood that
their repose was never interrupted by nocturnal devotion; "quoiqu'on ne
laisse pas de sonner pour l'edification du peuple."]

[Footnote 32: See a very sensible preface of Lucas Holstenius to the
Codex Regularum. The emperors attempted to support the obligation of
public and private duties; but the feeble dikes were swept away by
the torrent of superstition; and Justinian surpassed the most sanguine
wishes of the monks, (Thomassin, tom. i. p. 1782-1799, and Bingham,
l. vii. c. iii. p. 253.) Note: The emperor Valens, in particular,
promulgates a law contra ignavise quosdam sectatores, qui desertis
civitatum muneribus, captant solitudines secreta, et specie religionis

63.--G.]

The monastic profession of the ancients [33] was an act of voluntary
devotion. The inconstant fanatic was threatened with the eternal
vengeance of the God whom he deserted; but the doors of the monastery
were still open for repentance. Those monks, whose conscience was
fortified by reason or passion, were at liberty to resume the character
of men and citizens; and even the spouses of Christ might accept the
legal embraces of an earthly lover. [34] The examples of scandal, and
the progress of superstition, suggested the propriety of more forcible
restraints. After a sufficient trial, the fidelity of the novice was
secured by a solemn and perpetual vow; and his irrevocable engagement
was ratified by the laws of the church and state. A guilty fugitive
was pursued, arrested, and restored to his perpetual prison; and the
interposition of the magistrate oppressed the freedom and the merit,
which had alleviated, in some degree, the abject slavery of the
monastic discipline. [35] The actions of a monk, his words, and even his
thoughts, were determined by an inflexible rule, [36] or a capricious
superior: the slightest offences were corrected by disgrace or
confinement, extraordinary fasts, or bloody flagellation; and
disobedience, murmur, or delay, were ranked in the catalogue of the
most heinous sins. [37] A blind submission to the commands of the
abbot, however absurd, or even criminal, they might seem, was the ruling
principle, the first virtue of the Egyptian monks; and their patience
was frequently exercised by the most extravagant trials. They were
directed to remove an enormous rock; assiduously to water a barren
staff, that was planted in the ground, till, at the end of three
years, it should vegetate and blossom like a tree; to walk into a fiery
furnace; or to cast their infant into a deep pond: and several
saints, or madmen, have been immortalized in monastic story, by their
thoughtless and fearless obedience. [38] The freedom of the mind, the
source of every generous and rational sentiment, was destroyed by the
habits of credulity and submission; and the monk, contracting the
vices of a slave, devoutly followed the faith and passions of his
ecclesiastical tyrant. The peace of the Eastern church was invaded by
a swarm of fanatics, incapable of fear, or reason, or humanity; and the
Imperial troops acknowledged, without shame, that they were much less
apprehensive of an encounter with the fiercest Barbarians. [39]

[Footnote 33: The monastic institutions, particularly those of Egypt,
about the year 400, are described by four curious and devout travellers;
Rufinus, (Vit. Patrum, l. ii. iii. p. 424-536,) Posthumian, (Sulp.
Sever. Dialog. i.) Palladius, (Hist. Lausiac. in Vit. Patrum, p.
709-863,) and Cassian, (see in tom. vii. Bibliothec. Max. Patrum,
his four first books of Institutes, and the twenty-four Collations or
Conferences.)]

[Footnote 34: The example of Malchus, (Jerom, tom. i. p. 256,) and
the design of Cassian and his friend, (Collation. xxiv. 1,) are
incontestable proofs of their freedom; which is elegantly described by
Erasmus in his Life of St. Jerom. See Chardon, Hist. des Sacremens, tom.
vi. p. 279-300.]

[Footnote 35: See the Laws of Justinian, (Novel. cxxiii. No. 42,) and of
Lewis the Pious, (in the Historians of France, tom vi. p. 427,) and the
actual jurisprudence of France, in Denissart, (Decisions, &c., tom. iv.
p. 855,) &c.]

[Footnote 36: The ancient Codex Regularum, collected by Benedict
Anianinus, the reformer of the monks in the beginning of the ninth
century, and published in the seventeenth, by Lucas Holstenius, contains
thirty different rules for men and women. Of these, seven were composed
in Egypt, one in the East, one in Cappadocia, one in Italy, one in
Africa, four in Spain, eight in Gaul, or France, and one in England.]

[Footnote 37: The rule of Columbanus, so prevalent in the West, inflicts
one hundred lashes for very slight offences, (Cod. Reg. part ii. p.
174.) Before the time of Charlemagne, the abbots indulged themselves
in mutilating their monks, or putting out their eyes; a punishment much
less cruel than the tremendous vade in pace (the subterraneous dungeon
or sepulchre) which was afterwards invented. See an admirable discourse
of the learned Mabillon, (Oeuvres Posthumes, tom. ii. p. 321-336,) who,
on this occasion, seems to be inspired by the genius of humanity. For
such an effort, I can forgive his defence of the holy tear of Vendeme
(p. 361-399.)]

[Footnote 38: Sulp. Sever. Dialog. i. 12, 13, p. 532, &c. Cassian.
Institut. l. iv. c. 26, 27. "Praecipua ibi virtus et prima est
obedientia." Among the Verba seniorum, (in Vit. Patrum, l. v. p. 617,)
the fourteenth libel or discourse is on the subject of obedience; and
the Jesuit Rosweyde, who published that huge volume for the use of
convents, has collected all the scattered passages in his two copious
indexes.]

[Footnote 39: Dr. Jortin (Remarks on Ecclesiastical History, vol. iv. p.
161) has observed the scandalous valor of the Cappadocian monks, which
was exemplified in the banishment of Chrysostom.] Superstition has often
framed and consecrated the fantastic garments of the monks: [40]
but their apparent singularity sometimes proceeds from their uniform
attachment to a simple and primitive model, which the revolutions of
fashion have made ridiculous in the eyes of mankind. The father of
the Benedictines expressly disclaims all idea of choice of merit; and
soberly exhorts his disciples to adopt the coarse and convenient dress
of the countries which they may inhabit. [41] The monastic habits of
the ancients varied with the climate, and their mode of life; and they
assumed, with the same indifference, the sheep-skin of the Egyptian
peasants, or the cloak of the Grecian philosophers. They allowed
themselves the use of linen in Egypt, where it was a cheap and domestic
manufacture; but in the West they rejected such an expensive article of
foreign luxury. [42] It was the practice of the monks either to cut or
shave their hair; they wrapped their heads in a cowl to escape the
sight of profane objects; their legs and feet were naked, except in the
extreme cold of winter; and their slow and feeble steps were supported
by a long staff. The aspect of a genuine anachoret was horrid and
disgusting: every sensation that is offensive to man was thought
acceptable to God; and the angelic rule of Tabenne condemned the
salutary custom of bathing the limbs in water, and of anointing them
with oil. [43] [431] The austere monks slept on the ground, on a hard
mat, or a rough blanket; and the same bundle of palm-leaves served them
as a seat in the lay, and a pillow in the night. Their original cells
were low, narrow huts, built of the slightest materials; which formed,
by the regular distribution of the streets, a large and populous
village, enclosing, within the common wall, a church, a hospital,
perhaps a library, some necessary offices, a garden, and a fountain or
reservoir of fresh water. Thirty or forty brethren composed a family
of separate discipline and diet; and the great monasteries of Egypt
consisted of thirty or forty families.

monastic habit of Egypt, (Institut. l. i.,) to which Sozomen (l. iii. c.
14) attributes such allegorical meaning and virtue.]

horror of clear water, by which his feet were uncontaminated except
under dire necessity--M.]
