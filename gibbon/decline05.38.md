## Chapter LVI: The Saracens, The Franks And The Normans.--Part III.

Roger, the twelfth and last of the sons of Tancred, had been long
detained in Normandy by his own and his father' age. He accepted the
welcome summons; hastened to the Apulian camp; and deserved at first the
esteem, and afterwards the envy, of his elder brother. Their valor and
ambition were equal; but the youth, the beauty, the elegant manners,
of Roger engaged the disinterested love of the soldiers and people.
So scanty was his allowance for himself and forty followers, that he
descended from conquest to robbery, and from robbery to domestic theft;
and so loose were the notions of property, that, by his own historian,
at his special command, he is accused of stealing horses from a stable
at Melphi. [52] His spirit emerged from poverty and disgrace: from these
base practices he rose to the merit and glory of a holy war; and the
invasion of Sicily was seconded by the zeal and policy of his brother
Guiscard. After the retreat of the Greeks, the idolaters, a most
audacious reproach of the Catholics, had retrieved their losses and
possessions; but the deliverance of the island, so vainly undertaken by
the forces of the Eastern empire, was achieved by a small and private
band of adventurers. [53] In the first attempt, Roger braved, in an open
boat, the real and fabulous dangers of Scylla and Charybdis; landed with
only sixty soldiers on a hostile shore; drove the Saracens to the gates
of Messina and safely returned with the spoils of the adjacent country.
In the fortress of Trani, his active and patient courage were equally
conspicuous. In his old age he related with pleasure, that, by the
distress of the siege, himself, and the countess his wife, had been
reduced to a single cloak or mantle, which they wore alternately; that
in a sally his horse had been slain, and he was dragged away by the
Saracens; but that he owed his rescue to his good sword, and had
retreated with his saddle on his back, lest the meanest trophy might
be left in the hands of the miscreants. In the siege of Trani, three
hundred Normans withstood and repulsed the forces of the island. In the
field of Ceramio, fifty thousand horse and foot were overthrown by one
hundred and thirty-six Christian soldiers, without reckoning St. George,
who fought on horseback in the foremost ranks. The captive banners, with
four camels, were reserved for the successor of St. Peter; and had these
barbaric spoils been exposed, not in the Vatican, but in the Capitol,
they might have revived the memory of the Punic triumphs. These
insufficient numbers of the Normans most probably denote their knights,
the soldiers of honorable and equestrian rank, each of whom was attended
by five or six followers in the field; [54] yet, with the aid of this
interpretation, and after every fair allowance on the side of valor,
arms, and reputation, the discomfiture of so many myriads will reduce
the prudent reader to the alternative of a miracle or a fable. The Arabs
of Sicily derived a frequent and powerful succor from their countrymen
of Africa: in the siege of Palermo, the Norman cavalry was assisted by
the galleys of Pisa; and, in the hour of action, the envy of the two
brothers was sublimed to a generous and invincible emulation. After a
war of thirty years, [55] Roger, with the title of great count,
obtained the sovereignty of the largest and most fruitful island of the
Mediterranean; and his administration displays a liberal and enlightened
mind, above the limits of his age and education. The Moslems were
maintained in the free enjoyment of their religion and property: [56] a
philosopher and physician of Mazara, of the race of Mahomet, harangued
the conqueror, and was invited to court; his geography of the seven
climates was translated into Latin; and Roger, after a diligent perusal,
preferred the work of the Arabian to the writings of the Grecian
Ptolemy. [57] A remnant of Christian natives had promoted the success of
the Normans: they were rewarded by the triumph of the cross. The island
was restored to the jurisdiction of the Roman pontiff; new bishops
were planted in the principal cities; and the clergy was satisfied by
a liberal endowment of churches and monasteries. Yet the Catholic hero
asserted the rights of the civil magistrate. Instead of resigning the
investiture of benefices, he dexterously applied to his own profit the
papal claims: the supremacy of the crown was secured and enlarged, by
the singular bull, which declares the princes of Sicily hereditary and
perpetual legates of the Holy See. [58]

[Footnote 52: Latrocinio armigerorum suorum in multis sustentabatur,
quod quidem ad ejus ignominiam non dicimus; sed ipso ita praecipiente
adhuc viliora et reprehensibiliora dicturi sumus ut pluribus patescat,
quam laboriose et cum quanta angustia a profunda paupertate ad summum
culmen divitiarum vel honoris attigerit. Such is the preface of
Malaterra (l. i. c. 25) to the horse-stealing. From the moment (l. i. c.
19) that he has mentioned his patron Roger, the elder brother sinks into
the second character. Something similar in Velleius Paterculus may be
observed of Augustus and Tiberius.]

[Footnote 53: Duo sibi proficua deputans animae scilicet et corporis si

l. ii. c. 1.) The conquest of Sicily is related in the three last
books, and he himself has given an accurate summary of the chapters, (p.
544-546.)]

[Footnote 54: See the word Milites in the Latin Glossary of Ducange.]

[Footnote 55: Of odd particulars, I learn from Malaterra, that the
Arabs had introduced into Sicily the use of camels (l. i. c. 33) and of
carrier-pigeons, (c. 42;) and that the bite of the tarantula provokes a
windy disposition, quae per anum inhoneste crepitando emergit; a symptom
most ridiculously felt by the whole Norman army in their camp near
Palermo, (c. 36.) I shall add an etymology not unworthy of the xith
century: Messana is divided from Messis, the place from whence the
harvests of the isle were sent in tribute to Rome, (l. ii. c. 1.)]

[Footnote 56: See the capitulation of Palermo in Malaterra, l. ii. c.
45, and Giannone, who remarks the general toleration of the Saracens,
(tom ii. p. 72.)]

named Esseriph Essachalli, and he died in Africa, A. H. 516, A.D. 1122.
Yet this story bears a strange resemblance to the Sherif al Edrissi, who
presented his book (Geographia Nubiensis, see preface p. 88, 90, 170) to
Roger, king of Sicily, A. H. 541, A.D. 1153, (D'Herbelot, Bibliotheque

[Footnote 58: Malaterra remarks the foundation of the bishoprics,
(l. iv. c. 7,) and produces the original of the bull, (l. iv. c. 29.)
Giannone gives a rational idea of this privilege, and the tribunal of
the monarchy of Sicily, (tom. ii. p. 95-102;) and St. Marc (Abrege,
tom. iii. p. 217-301, 1st column) labors the case with the diligence of
a Sicilian lawyer.]

To Robert Guiscard, the conquest of Sicily was more glorious than
beneficial: the possession of Apulia and Calabria was inadequate to his
ambition; and he resolved to embrace or create the first occasion of
invading, perhaps of subduing, the Roman empire of the East. [59] From
his first wife, the partner of his humble fortune, he had been divorced
under the pretence of consanguinity; and her son Bohemond was destined
to imitate, rather than to succeed, his illustrious father. The second
wife of Guiscard was the daughter of the princes of Salerno; the
Lombards acquiesced in the lineal succession of their son Roger; their
five daughters were given in honorable nuptials, [60] and one of them
was betrothed, in a tender age, to Constantine, a beautiful youth,
the son and heir of the emperor Michael. [61] But the throne of
Constantinople was shaken by a revolution: the Imperial family of Ducas
was confined to the palace or the cloister; and Robert deplored, and
resented, the disgrace of his daughter and the expulsion of his ally.
A Greek, who styled himself the father of Constantine, soon appeared
at Salerno, and related the adventures of his fall and flight. That
unfortunate friend was acknowledged by the duke, and adorned with the
pomp and titles of Imperial dignity: in his triumphal progress through
Apulia and Calabria, Michael [62] was saluted with the tears and
acclamations of the people; and Pope Gregory the Seventh exhorted the
bishops to preach, and the Catholics to fight, in the pious work of his
restoration. His conversations with Robert were frequent and familiar;
and their mutual promises were justified by the valor of the Normans and
the treasures of the East. Yet this Michael, by the confession of the
Greeks and Latins, was a pageant and an impostor; a monk who had fled
from his convent, or a domestic who had served in the palace. The fraud
had been contrived by the subtle Guiscard; and he trusted, that after
this pretender had given a decent color to his arms, he would sink, at
the nod of the conqueror, into his primitive obscurity. But victory was
the only argument that could determine the belief of the Greeks; and
the ardor of the Latins was much inferior to their credulity: the Norman
veterans wished to enjoy the harvest of their toils, and the unwarlike
Italians trembled at the known and unknown dangers of a transmarine
expedition. In his new levies, Robert exerted the influence of gifts and
promises, the terrors of civil and ecclesiastical authority; and some
acts of violence might justify the reproach, that age and infancy
were pressed without distinction into the service of their unrelenting
prince. After two years' incessant preparations the land and naval
forces were assembled at Otranto, at the heel, or extreme promontory, of
Italy; and Robert was accompanied by his wife, who fought by his
side, his son Bohemond, and the representative of the emperor Michael.
Thirteen hundred knights [63] of Norman race or discipline, formed
the sinews of the army, which might be swelled to thirty thousand [64]
followers of every denomination. The men, the horses, the arms, the
engines, the wooden towers, covered with raw hides, were embarked on
board one hundred and fifty vessels: the transports had been built in
the ports of Italy, and the galleys were supplied by the alliance of the
republic of Ragusa.

[Footnote 59: In the first expedition of Robert against the Greeks,
I follow Anna Comnena, (the ist, iiid, ivth, and vth books of the
Alexiad,) William Appulus, (l. ivth and vth, p. 270-275,) and Jeffrey
Malaterra, (l. iii. c. 13, 14, 24-29, 39.) Their information is
contemporary and authentic, but none of them were eye-witnesses of the
war.]

[Footnote 60: One of them was married to Hugh, the son of Azzo, or Axo,
a marquis of Lombardy, rich, powerful, and noble, (Gulielm. Appul. l.
iii. p. 267,) in the xith century, and whose ancestors in the xth and
ixth are explored by the critical industry of Leibnitz and Muratori.
From the two elder sons of the marquis Azzo are derived the illustrious
lines of Brunswick and Este. See Muratori, Antichita Estense.]

[Footnote 61: Anna Comnena, somewhat too wantonly, praises and bewails
that handsome boy, who, after the rupture of his barbaric nuptials,
(l. i. p. 23,) was betrothed as her husband. (p. 27.) Elsewhere she
describes the red and white of his skin, his hawk's eyes, &c., l. iii.
p. 71.]

[Footnote 62: Anna Comnena, l. i. p. 28, 29. Gulielm. Appul. l. iv p.
271. Galfrid Malaterra, l. iii. c. 13, p. 579, 580. Malaterra is more
cautious in his style; but the Apulian is bold and positive.--Mentitus
se Michaelem Venerata Danais quidam seductor ad illum. As Gregory VII
had believed, Baronius almost alone, recognizes the emperor Michael.
(A.D. No. 44.)]

[Footnote 63: Ipse armatae militiae non plusquam MCCC milites secum
habuisse, ab eis qui eidem negotio interfuerunt attestatur, (Malaterra,
l. iii. c. 24, p. 583.) These are the same whom the Apulian (l. iv. p.
273) styles the equestris gens ducis, equites de gente ducis.]

[Footnote 64: Anna Comnena (Alexias, l. i. p. 37;) and her account
tallies with the number and lading of the ships. Ivit in Dyrrachium cum
xv. millibus hominum, says the Chronicon Breve Normannicum, (Muratori,
Scriptores, tom. v. p. 278.) I have endeavored to reconcile these
reckonings.]

At the mouth of the Adriatic Gulf, the shores of Italy and Epirus
incline towards each other. The space between Brundusium and Durazzo,
the Roman passage, is no more than one hundred miles; [65] at the last
station of Otranto, it is contracted to fifty; [66] and this narrow
distance had suggested to Pyrrhus and Pompey the sublime or extravagant
idea of a bridge. Before the general embarkation, the Norman duke
despatched Bohemond with fifteen galleys to seize or threaten the Isle
of Corfu, to survey the opposite coast, and to secure a harbor in the
neighborhood of Vallona for the landing of the troops. They passed
and landed without perceiving an enemy; and this successful experiment
displayed the neglect and decay of the naval power of the Greeks. The
islands of Epirus and the maritime towns were subdued by the arms or the
name of Robert, who led his fleet and army from Corfu (I use the modern
appellation) to the siege of Durazzo. That city, the western key of the
empire, was guarded by ancient renown, and recent fortifications, by
George Palaeologus, a patrician, victorious in the Oriental wars, and a
numerous garrison of Albanians and Macedonians, who, in every age,
have maintained the character of soldiers. In the prosecution of his
enterprise, the courage of Guiscard was assailed by every form of danger
and mischance. In the most propitious season of the year, as his fleet
passed along the coast, a storm of wind and snow unexpectedly arose:
the Adriatic was swelled by the raging blast of the south, and a new
shipwreck confirmed the old infamy of the Acroceraunian rocks. [67] The
sails, the masts, and the oars, were shattered or torn away; the sea
and shore were covered with the fragments of vessels, with arms and dead
bodies; and the greatest part of the provisions were either drowned or
damaged. The ducal galley was laboriously rescued from the waves, and
Robert halted seven days on the adjacent cape, to collect the relics of
his loss, and revive the drooping spirits of his soldiers. The Normans
were no longer the bold and experienced mariners who had explored the
ocean from Greenland to Mount Atlas, and who smiled at the petty dangers
of the Mediterranean. They had wept during the tempest; they were
alarmed by the hostile approach of the Venetians, who had been solicited
by the prayers and promises of the Byzantine court. The first day's
action was not disadvantageous to Bohemond, a beardless youth, [68]
who led the naval powers of his father. All night the galleys of the
republic lay on their anchors in the form of a crescent; and the victory
of the second day was decided by the dexterity of their evolutions, the
station of their archers, the weight of their javelins, and the borrowed
aid of the Greek fire. The Apulian and Ragusian vessels fled to the
shore, several were cut from their cables, and dragged away by the
conqueror; and a sally from the town carried slaughter and dismay to the
tents of the Norman duke. A seasonable relief was poured into Durazzo,
and as soon as the besiegers had lost the command of the sea, the
islands and maritime towns withdrew from the camp the supply of tribute
and provision. That camp was soon afflicted with a pestilential disease;
five hundred knights perished by an inglorious death; and the list of
burials (if all could obtain a decent burial) amounted to ten thousand
persons. Under these calamities, the mind of Guiscard alone was firm and
invincible; and while he collected new forces from Apulia and Sicily, he
battered, or scaled, or sapped, the walls of Durazzo. But his industry
and valor were encountered by equal valor and more perfect industry. A
movable turret, of a size and capacity to contain five hundred soldiers,
had been rolled forwards to the foot of the rampart: but the descent of
the door or drawbridge was checked by an enormous beam, and the wooden
structure was constantly consumed by artificial flames.

[Footnote 65: The Itinerary of Jerusalem (p. 609, edit. Wesseling) gives
a true and reasonable space of a thousand stadia or one hundred miles
which is strangely doubled by Strabo (l. vi. p. 433) and Pliny, (Hist.
Natur. iii. 16.)]

[Footnote 66: Pliny (Hist. Nat. iii. 6, 16) allows quinquaginta millia
for this brevissimus cursus, and agrees with the real distance from
Otranto to La Vallona, or Aulon, (D'Anville, Analyse de sa Carte des
Cotes de la Grece, &c., p. 3-6.) Hermolaus Barbarus, who substitutes
centum. (Harduin, Not. lxvi. in Plin. l. iii.,) might have been
corrected by every Venetian pilot who had sailed out of the gulf.]

[Footnote 67: Infames scopulos Acroceraunia, Horat. carm. i. 3. The
praecipitem Africum decertantem Aquilonibus, et rabiem Noti and the
monstra natantia of the Adriatic, are somewhat enlarged; but Horace
trembling for the life of Virgil, is an interesting moment in the
history of poetry and friendship.]

[Footnote 68: (Alexias, l. iv. p. 106.) Yet the Normans shaved, and the
Venetians wore, their beards: they must have derided the no beard of
Bohemond; a harsh interpretation. (Duncanga ad Alexiad. p. 283.)]

While the Roman empire was attacked by the Turks in the East, east, and
the Normans in the West, the aged successor of Michael surrendered the
sceptre to the hands of Alexius, an illustrious captain, and the founder
of the Comnenian dynasty. The princess Anne, his daughter and historian,
observes, in her affected style, that even Hercules was unequal to a
double combat; and, on this principle, she approves a hasty peace with
the Turks, which allowed her father to undertake in person the relief of
Durazzo. On his accession, Alexius found the camp without soldiers, and
the treasury without money; yet such were the vigor and activity of his
measures, that in six months he assembled an army of seventy thousand
men, [69] and performed a march of five hundred miles. His troops were
levied in Europe and Asia, from Peloponnesus to the Black Sea; his
majesty was displayed in the silver arms and rich trappings of the
companies of Horse-guards; and the emperor was attended by a train of
nobles and princes, some of whom, in rapid succession, had been clothed
with the purple, and were indulged by the lenity of the times in a
life of affluence and dignity. Their youthful ardor might animate the
multitude; but their love of pleasure and contempt of subordination were
pregnant with disorder and mischief; and their importunate clamors for
speedy and decisive action disconcerted the prudence of Alexius, who
might have surrounded and starved the besieging army. The enumeration of
provinces recalls a sad comparison of the past and present limits of the
Roman world: the raw levies were drawn together in haste and terror;
and the garrisons of Anatolia, or Asia Minor, had been purchased by the
evacuation of the cities which were immediately occupied by the
Turks. The strength of the Greek army consisted in the Varangians, the
Scandinavian guards, whose numbers were recently augmented by a colony
of exiles and volunteers from the British Island of Thule. Under the
yoke of the Norman conqueror, the Danes and English were oppressed
and united; a band of adventurous youths resolved to desert a land
of slavery; the sea was open to their escape; and, in their long
pilgrimage, they visited every coast that afforded any hope of liberty
and revenge. They were entertained in the service of the Greek emperor;
and their first station was in a new city on the Asiatic shore: but
Alexius soon recalled them to the defence of his person and palace; and
bequeathed to his successors the inheritance of their faith and valor.
[70] The name of a Norman invader revived the memory of their wrongs:
they marched with alacrity against the national foe, and panted
to regain in Epirus the glory which they had lost in the battle of
Hastings. The Varangians were supported by some companies of Franks or
Latins; and the rebels, who had fled to Constantinople from the tyranny
of Guiscard, were eager to signalize their zeal and gratify their
revenge. In this emergency, the emperor had not disdained the impure
aid of the Paulicians or Manichaeans of Thrace and Bulgaria; and these
heretics united with the patience of martyrdom the spirit and discipline
of active valor. [71] The treaty with the sultan had procured a supply
of some thousand Turks; and the arrows of the Scythian horse were
opposed to the lances of the Norman cavalry. On the report and distant
prospect of these formidable numbers, Robert assembled a council of his
principal officers. "You behold," said he, "your danger: it is urgent
and inevitable. The hills are covered with arms and standards; and the
emperor of the Greeks is accustomed to wars and triumphs. Obedience and
union are our only safety; and I am ready to yield the command to a more
worthy leader." The vote and acclamation even of his secret enemies,
assured him, in that perilous moment, of their esteem and confidence;
and the duke thus continued: "Let us trust in the rewards of victory,
and deprive cowardice of the means of escape. Let us burn our vessels
and our baggage, and give battle on this spot, as if it were the
place of our nativity and our burial." The resolution was unanimously
approved; and, without confining himself to his lines, Guiscard awaited
in battle-array the nearer approach of the enemy. His rear was covered
by a small river; his right wing extended to the sea; his left to the
hills: nor was he conscious, perhaps, that on the same ground Caesar and
Pompey had formerly disputed the empire of the world. [72]

[Footnote 69: Muratori (Annali d' Italia, tom. ix. p. 136, 137)
observes, that some authors (Petrus Diacon. Chron. Casinen. l. iii. c.
49) compose the Greek army of 170,000 men, but that the hundred may
be struck off, and that Malaterra reckons only 70,000; a slight
inattention. The passage to which he alludes is in the Chronicle of
Lupus Protospata, (Script. Ital. tom. v. p. 45.) Malaterra (l. iv.
c. 27) speaks in high, but indefinite terms of the emperor, cum
copiisinnumerabilbus: like the Apulian poet, (l. iv. p. 272:)
--More locustarum montes et pianna teguntur.]

[Footnote 70: See William of Malmsbury, de Gestis Anglorum, l. ii. p.
92. Alexius fidem Anglorum suspiciens praecipuis familiaritatibus suis

Eccles. l. iv. p. 508, l. vii. p. 641) relates their emigration from
England, and their service in Greece.]

[Footnote 71: See the Apulian, (l. i. p. 256.) The character and the
story of these Manichaeans has been the subject of the livth chapter.]

[Footnote 72: See the simple and masterly narrative of Caesar himself,
(Comment. de Bell. Civil. iii. 41-75.) It is a pity that Quintus
Icilius (M. Guichard) did not live to analyze these operations, as he
has done the campaigns of Africa and Spain.]

Against the advice of his wisest captains, Alexius resolved to risk
the event of a general action, and exhorted the garrison of Durazzo to
assist their own deliverance by a well-timed sally from the town. He
marched in two columns to surprise the Normans before daybreak on two
different sides: his light cavalry was scattered over the plain; the
archers formed the second line; and the Varangians claimed the honors of
the vanguard. In the first onset, the battle-axes of the strangers made
a deep and bloody impression on the army of Guiscard, which was
now reduced to fifteen thousand men. The Lombards and Calabrians
ignominiously turned their backs; they fled towards the river and the
sea; but the bridge had been broken down to check the sally of the
garrison, and the coast was lined with the Venetian galleys, who played
their engines among the disorderly throng. On the verge of ruin, they
were saved by the spirit and conduct of their chiefs. Gaita, the wife of
Robert, is painted by the Greeks as a warlike Amazon, a second Pallas;
less skilful in arts, but not less terrible in arms, than the Athenian
goddess: [73] though wounded by an arrow, she stood her ground, and
strove, by her exhortation and example, to rally the flying troops. [74]
Her female voice was seconded by the more powerful voice and arm of
the Norman duke, as calm in action as he was magnanimous in council:
"Whither," he cried aloud, "whither do ye fly? Your enemy is implacable;
and death is less grievous than servitude." The moment was decisive: as
the Varangians advanced before the line, they discovered the nakedness
of their flanks: the main battle of the duke, of eight hundred knights,
stood firm and entire; they couched their lances, and the Greeks deplore
the furious and irresistible shock of the French cavalry. [75] Alexius
was not deficient in the duties of a soldier or a general; but he no
sooner beheld the slaughter of the Varangians, and the flight of the
Turks, than he despised his subjects, and despaired of his fortune. The
princess Anne, who drops a tear on this melancholy event, is reduced
to praise the strength and swiftness of her father's horse, and his
vigorous struggle when he was almost overthrown by the stroke of a
lance, which had shivered the Imperial helmet. His desperate valor broke
through a squadron of Franks who opposed his flight; and after wandering
two days and as many nights in the mountains, he found some repose,
of body, though not of mind, in the walls of Lychnidus. The victorious
Robert reproached the tardy and feeble pursuit which had suffered the
escape of so illustrious a prize: but he consoled his disappointment by
the trophies and standards of the field, the wealth and luxury of the
Byzantine camp, and the glory of defeating an army five times more
numerous than his own. A multitude of Italians had been the victims
of their own fears; but only thirty of his knights were slain in
this memorable day. In the Roman host, the loss of Greeks, Turks, and
English, amounted to five or six thousand: [76] the plain of Durazzo was
stained with noble and royal blood; and the end of the impostor Michael
was more honorable than his life.

[Footnote 73: It is very properly translated by the President Cousin,
(Hist. de Constantinople, tom. iv. p. 131, in 12mo.,) qui combattoit
comme une Pallas, quoiqu'elle ne fut pas aussi savante que celle
d'Athenes. The Grecian goddess was composed of two discordant
characters, of Neith, the workwoman of Sais in Egypt, and of a virgin
Amazon of the Tritonian lake in Libya, (Banier, Mythologie, tom. iv. p.
1-31, in 12mo.)]

[Footnote 74: Anna Comnena (l. iv. p. 116) admires, with some degree of
terror, her masculine virtues. They were more familiar to the Latins and
though the Apulian (l. iv. p. 273) mentions her presence and her wound,
he represents her as far less intrepid.

     Uxor in hoc bello Roberti forte sagitta

     Quadam laesa fuit: quo vulnere territa nullam.

     Dum sperabat opem, se poene subegerat hosti.

The last is an unlucky word for a female prisoner.]

[Footnote 75: (Anna, l. v. p. 133;) and elsewhere, (p. 140.) The
pedantry of the princess in the choice of classic appellations
encouraged Ducange to apply to his countrymen the characters of the
ancient Gauls.]

[Footnote 76: Lupus Protospata (tom. iii. p. 45) says 6000: William the
Apulian more than 5000, (l. iv. p. 273.) Their modesty is singular and
laudable: they might with so little trouble have slain two or three
myriads of schismatics and infidels!]

It is more than probable that Guiscard was not afflicted by the loss of
a costly pageant, which had merited only the contempt and derision of
the Greeks. After their defeat, they still persevered in the defence
of Durazzo; and a Venetian commander supplied the place of George
Palaeologus, who had been imprudently called away from his station.
The tents of the besiegers were converted into barracks, to sustain the
inclemency of the winter; and in answer to the defiance of the garrison,
Robert insinuated, that his patience was at least equal to their
obstinacy. [77] Perhaps he already trusted to his secret correspondence
with a Venetian noble, who sold the city for a rich and honorable
marriage. At the dead of night, several rope-ladders were dropped from
the walls; the light Calabrians ascended in silence; and the Greeks were
awakened by the name and trumpets of the conqueror. Yet they defended
the streets three days against an enemy already master of the rampart;
and near seven months elapsed between the first investment and the final
surrender of the place. From Durazzo, the Norman duke advanced into the
heart of Epirus or Albania; traversed the first mountains of Thessaly;
surprised three hundred English in the city of Castoria; approached
Thessalonica; and made Constantinople tremble. A more pressing duty
suspended the prosecution of his ambitious designs. By shipwreck,
pestilence, and the sword, his army was reduced to a third of the
original numbers; and instead of being recruited from Italy, he was
informed, by plaintive epistles, of the mischiefs and dangers which had
been produced by his absence: the revolt of the cities and barons of
Apulia; the distress of the pope; and the approach or invasion of Henry
king of Germany. Highly presuming that his person was sufficient for the
public safety, he repassed the sea in a single brigantine, and left the
remains of the army under the command of his son and the Norman counts,
exhorting Bohemond to respect the freedom of his peers, and the counts
to obey the authority of their leader. The son of Guiscard trod in the
footsteps of his father; and the two destroyers are compared, by the
Greeks, to the caterpillar and the locust, the last of whom devours
whatever has escaped the teeth of the former. [78] After winning two
battles against the emperor, he descended into the plain of Thessaly,
and besieged Larissa, the fabulous realm of Achilles, [79] which
contained the treasure and magazines of the Byzantine camp. Yet a just
praise must not be refused to the fortitude and prudence of Alexius, who
bravely struggled with the calamities of the times. In the poverty
of the state, he presumed to borrow the superfluous ornaments of the
churches: the desertion of the Manichaeans was supplied by some tribes
of Moldavia: a reenforcement of seven thousand Turks replaced and
revenged the loss of their brethren; and the Greek soldiers were
exercised to ride, to draw the bow, and to the daily practice of
ambuscades and evolutions. Alexius had been taught by experience, that
the formidable cavalry of the Franks on foot was unfit for action, and
almost incapable of motion; [80] his archers were directed to aim their
arrows at the horse rather than the man; and a variety of spikes and
snares were scattered over the ground on which he might expect an
attack. In the neighborhood of Larissa the events of war were protracted
and balanced. The courage of Bohemond was always conspicuous, and often
successful; but his camp was pillaged by a stratagem of the Greeks; the
city was impregnable; and the venal or discontented counts deserted
his standard, betrayed their trusts, and enlisted in the service of the
emperor. Alexius returned to Constantinople with the advantage, rather
than the honor, of victory. After evacuating the conquests which he
could no longer defend, the son of Guiscard embarked for Italy, and
was embraced by a father who esteemed his merit, and sympathized in his
misfortune.

[Footnote 77: The Romans had changed the inauspicious name of Epidamnus
to Dyrrachium, (Plin. iii. 26;) and the vulgar corruption of Duracium
(see Malaterra) bore some affinity to hardness. One of Robert's names
was Durand, a durando: poor wit! (Alberic. Monach. in Chron. apud
Muratori, Annali d'Italia, tom. ix. p. 137.)]

[Footnote 78: (Anna, l. i. p. 35.) By these similes, so different from
those of Homer she wishes to inspire contempt as well as horror for
the little noxious animal, a conqueror. Most unfortunately, the common
sense, or common nonsense, of mankind, resists her laudable design.]

[Footnote 79: Prodiit hac auctor Trojanae cladis Achilles. The
supposition of the Apulian (l. v. p. 275) may be excused by the more
classic poetry of Virgil, (Aeneid. ii. 197,) Larissaeus Achilles, but it
is not justified by the geography of Homer.]

[Footnote 80: The items which encumbered the knights on foot, have been
ignorantly translated spurs, (Anna Comnena, Alexias, l. v. p. 140.)
Ducange has explained the true sense by a ridiculous and inconvenient
fashion, which lasted from the xith to the xvth century. These peaks, in
the form of a scorpion, were sometimes two feet and fastened to the knee
with a silver chain.]
