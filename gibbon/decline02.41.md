## Chapter XXIII: Reign Of Julian.--Part IV.

The restoration of the Jewish temple was secretly connected with the
ruin of the Christian church. Julian still continued to maintain the
freedom of religious worship, without distinguishing whether this
universal toleration proceeded from his justice or his clemency. He
affected to pity the unhappy Christians, who were mistaken in the most
important object of their lives; but his pity was degraded by contempt,
his contempt was embittered by hatred; and the sentiments of Julian were
expressed in a style of sarcastic wit, which inflicts a deep and deadly
wound, whenever it issues from the mouth of a sovereign. As he was
sensible that the Christians gloried in the name of their Redeemer,
he countenanced, and perhaps enjoined, the use of the less honorable
appellation of Galilaeans. [85] He declared, that by the folly of the
Galilaeans, whom he describes as a sect of fanatics, contemptible to
men, and odious to the gods, the empire had been reduced to the brink of
destruction; and he insinuates in a public edict, that a frantic patient
might sometimes be cured by salutary violence. [86] An ungenerous
distinction was admitted into the mind and counsels of Julian, that,
according to the difference of their religious sentiments, one part
of his subjects deserved his favor and friendship, while the other was
entitled only to the common benefits that his justice could not refuse
to an obedient people. According to a principle, pregnant with mischief
and oppression, the emperor transferred to the pontiffs of his own
religion the management of the liberal allowances for the public
revenue, which had been granted to the church by the piety of
Constantine and his sons. The proud system of clerical honors and
immunities, which had been constructed with so much art and labor,
was levelled to the ground; the hopes of testamentary donations were
intercepted by the rigor of the laws; and the priests of the Christian
sect were confounded with the last and most ignominious class of the
people. Such of these regulations as appeared necessary to check the
ambition and avarice of the ecclesiastics, were soon afterwards imitated
by the wisdom of an orthodox prince. The peculiar distinctions which
policy has bestowed, or superstition has lavished, on the sacerdotal
order, must be confined to those priests who profess the religion of the
state. But the will of the legislator was not exempt from prejudice and
passion; and it was the object of the insidious policy of Julian, to
deprive the Christians of all the temporal honors and advantages which
rendered them respectable in the eyes of the world. [88]

[Footnote 85: Greg. Naz. Orat. iii. p. 81. And this law was confirmed by
the invariable practice of Julian himself. Warburton has justly observed
(p. 35,) that the Platonists believed in the mysterious virtue of
words and Julian's dislike for the name of Christ might proceed from
superstition, as well as from contempt.]

[Footnote 86: Fragment. Julian. p. 288. He derides the (Epist. vii.,)
and so far loses sight of the principles of toleration, as to wish
(Epist. xlii.).]

[Footnote 88: These laws, which affected the clergy, may be found in the
slight hints of Julian himself, (Epist. lii.) in the vague declamations
of Gregory, (Orat. iii. p. 86, 87,) and in the positive assertions of
Sozomen, (l. v. c. 5.)]

A just and severe censure has been inflicted on the law which prohibited
the Christians from teaching the arts of grammar and rhetoric. [89] The
motives alleged by the emperor to justify this partial and oppressive
measure, might command, during his lifetime, the silence of slaves and
the applause of Gatterers. Julian abuses the ambiguous meaning of a word
which might be indifferently applied to the language and the religion of
the Greeks: he contemptuously observes, that the men who exalt the
merit of implicit faith are unfit to claim or to enjoy the advantages of
science; and he vainly contends, that if they refuse to adore the
gods of Homer and Demosthenes, they ought to content themselves with
expounding Luke and Matthew in the church of the Galilaeans. [90] In all
the cities of the Roman world, the education of the youth was intrusted
to masters of grammar and rhetoric; who were elected by the magistrates,
maintained at the public expense, and distinguished by many lucrative
and honorable privileges. The edict of Julian appears to have included
the physicians, and professors of all the liberal arts; and the
emperor, who reserved to himself the approbation of the candidates, was
authorized by the laws to corrupt, or to punish, the religious constancy
of the most learned of the Christians. [91] As soon as the resignation
of the more obstinate [92] teachers had established the unrivalled
dominion of the Pagan sophists, Julian invited the rising generation to
resort with freedom to the public schools, in a just confidence, that
their tender minds would receive the impressions of literature and
idolatry. If the greatest part of the Christian youth should be deterred
by their own scruples, or by those of their parents, from accepting this
dangerous mode of instruction, they must, at the same time, relinquish
the benefits of a liberal education. Julian had reason to expect that,
in the space of a few years, the church would relapse into its primaeval
simplicity, and that the theologians, who possessed an adequate share
of the learning and eloquence of the age, would be succeeded by a
generation of blind and ignorant fanatics, incapable of defending the
truth of their own principles, or of exposing the various follies of
Polytheism. [93]

[Footnote 89: Inclemens.... perenni obruendum silentio. Ammian. xxii.
10, ixv. 5.]

[Footnote 90: The edict itself, which is still extant among the epistles
of Julian, (xlii.,) may be compared with the loose invectives of Gregory
(Orat. iii. p. 96.) Tillemont (Mem. Eccles. tom. vii. p. 1291-1294) has
collected the seeming differences of ancients and moderns. They may be
easily reconciled. The Christians were directly forbid to teach, they
were indirectly forbid to learn; since they would not frequent the
schools of the Pagans.]

[Footnote 93: They had recourse to the expedient of composing books
for their own schools. Within a few months Apollinaris produced his
Christian imitations of Homer, (a sacred history in twenty-four books,)
Pindar, Euripides, and Menander; and Sozomen is satisfied, that they
equalled, or excelled, the originals. * Note: Socrates, however, implies
that, on the death of Julian, they were contemptuously thrown aside by
the Christians. Socr. Hist. iii.16.--M.]

It was undoubtedly the wish and design of Julian to deprive the
Christians of the advantages of wealth, of knowledge, and of power; but
the injustice of excluding them from all offices of trust and profit
seems to have been the result of his general policy, rather than the
immediate consequence of any positive law. [94] Superior merit might
deserve and obtain, some extraordinary exceptions; but the greater part
of the Christian officers were gradually removed from their employments
in the state, the army, and the provinces. The hopes of future
candidates were extinguished by the declared partiality of a prince, who
maliciously reminded them, that it was unlawful for a Christian to use
the sword, either of justice, or of war; and who studiously guarded
the camp and the tribunals with the ensigns of idolatry. The powers of
government were intrusted to the pagans, who professed an ardent zeal
for the religion of their ancestors; and as the choice of the emperor
was often directed by the rules of divination, the favorites whom he
preferred as the most agreeable to the gods, did not always obtain the
approbation of mankind. [95] Under the administration of their enemies,
the Christians had much to suffer, and more to apprehend. The temper of
Julian was averse to cruelty; and the care of his reputation, which was
exposed to the eyes of the universe, restrained the philosophic monarch
from violating the laws of justice and toleration, which he himself had
so recently established. But the provincial ministers of his authority
were placed in a less conspicuous station. In the exercise of arbitrary
power, they consulted the wishes, rather than the commands, of their
sovereign; and ventured to exercise a secret and vexatious tyranny
against the sectaries, on whom they were not permitted to confer the
honors of martyrdom. The emperor, who dissembled as long as possible his
knowledge of the injustice that was exercised in his name, expressed
his real sense of the conduct of his officers, by gentle reproofs and
substantial rewards. [96]

[Footnote 94: It was the instruction of Julian to his magistrates,
(Epist. vii.,). Sozomen (l. v. c. 18) and Socrates (l. iii. c. 13) must
be reduced to the standard of Gregory, (Orat. iii. p. 95,) not less
prone to exaggeration, but more restrained by the actual knowledge of
his contemporary readers.]

[Footnote 95: Libanius, Orat. Parent. 88, p. 814.]

[Footnote 96: Greg. Naz. Orat. iii. p. 74, 91, 92. Socrates, l. iii. c.
14. The doret, l. iii. c. 6. Some drawback may, however, be allowed for
the violence of their zeal, not less partial than the zeal of Julian]

The most effectual instrument of oppression, with which they were
armed, was the law that obliged the Christians to make full and
ample satisfaction for the temples which they had destroyed under
the preceding reign. The zeal of the triumphant church had not always
expected the sanction of the public authority; and the bishops, who were
secure of impunity, had often marched at the head of their congregation,
to attack and demolish the fortresses of the prince of darkness. The
consecrated lands, which had increased the patrimony of the sovereign or
of the clergy, were clearly defined, and easily restored. But on these
lands, and on the ruins of Pagan superstition, the Christians had
frequently erected their own religious edifices: and as it was necessary
to remove the church before the temple could be rebuilt, the justice
and piety of the emperor were applauded by one party, while the other
deplored and execrated his sacrilegious violence. [97] After the ground
was cleared, the restitution of those stately structures which had been
levelled with the dust, and of the precious ornaments which had been
converted to Christian uses, swelled into a very large account of
damages and debt. The authors of the injury had neither the ability nor
the inclination to discharge this accumulated demand: and the impartial
wisdom of a legislator would have been displayed in balancing
the adverse claims and complaints, by an equitable and temperate
arbitration.

But the whole empire, and particularly the East, was thrown into
confusion by the rash edicts of Julian; and the Pagan magistrates,
inflamed by zeal and revenge, abused the rigorous privilege of the Roman
law, which substitutes, in the place of his inadequate property, the
person of the insolvent debtor. Under the preceding reign, Mark, bishop
of Arethusa, [98] had labored in the conversion of his people with arms
more effectual than those of persuasion. [99] The magistrates required
the full value of a temple which had been destroyed by his intolerant
zeal: but as they were satisfied of his poverty, they desired only to
bend his inflexible spirit to the promise of the slightest compensation.
They apprehended the aged prelate, they inhumanly scourged him, they
tore his beard; and his naked body, annointed with honey, was suspended,
in a net, between heaven and earth, and exposed to the stings of insects
and the rays of a Syrian sun. [100] From this lofty station, Mark still
persisted to glory in his crime, and to insult the impotent rage of his
persecutors. He was at length rescued from their hands, and dismissed to
enjoy the honor of his divine triumph. The Arians celebrated the
virtue of their pious confessor; the Catholics ambitiously claimed his
alliance; [101] and the Pagans, who might be susceptible of shame or
remorse, were deterred from the repetition of such unavailing cruelty.
[102] Julian spared his life: but if the bishop of Arethusa had saved
the infancy of Julian, [103] posterity will condemn the ingratitude,
instead of praising the clemency, of the emperor.

[Footnote 97: If we compare the gentle language of Libanius (Orat.
Parent c. 60. p. 286) with the passionate exclamations of Gregory,
(Orat. iii. p. 86, 87,) we may find it difficult to persuade ourselves
that the two orators are really describing the same events.]

[Footnote 98: Restan, or Arethusa, at the equal distance of sixteen
miles between Emesa (Hems) and Epiphania, (Hamath,) was founded, or at
least named, by Seleucus Nicator. Its peculiar aera dates from the year
of Rome 685, according to the medals of the city. In the decline of the
Seleucides, Emesa and Arethusa were usurped by the Arab Sampsiceramus,
whose posterity, the vassals of Rome, were not extinguished in the reign
of Vespasian.----See D'Anville's Maps and Geographie Ancienne, tom. ii.
p. 134. Wesseling, Itineraria, p. 188, and Noris. Epoch Syro-Macedon, p.
80, 481, 482.]

[Footnote 99: Sozomen, l. v. c. 10. It is surprising, that Gregory and
Theodoret should suppress a circumstance, which, in their eyes, must
have enhanced the religious merit of the confessor.]

[Footnote 100: The sufferings and constancy of Mark, which Gregory
has so tragically painted, (Orat. iii. p. 88-91,) are confirmed by the
unexceptionable and reluctant evidence of Libanius. Epist. 730, p. 350,
351. Edit. Wolf. Amstel. 1738.]

[Footnote 101: Certatim eum sibi (Christiani) vindicant. It is thus that
La Croze and Wolfius (ad loc.) have explained a Greek word, whose true
signification had been mistaken by former interpreters, and even by
Le Clerc, (Bibliotheque Ancienne et Moderne, tom. iii. p. 371.) Yet
Tillemont is strangely puzzled to understand (Mem. Eccles. tom. vii. p.
1390) how Gregory and Theodoret could mistake a Semi-Arian bishop for a
saint.]

[Footnote 102: See the probable advice of Sallust, (Greg. Nazianzen,
Orat. iii. p. 90, 91.) Libanius intercedes for a similar offender, lest
they should find many Marks; yet he allows, that if Orion had secreted
the consecrated wealth, he deserved to suffer the punishment of Marsyas;
to be flayed alive, (Epist. 730, p. 349-351.)]

[Footnote 103: Gregory (Orat. iii. p. 90) is satisfied that, by saving
the apostate, Mark had deserved still more than he had suffered.]

At the distance of five miles from Antioch, the Macedonian kings of
Syria had consecrated to Apollo one of the most elegant places of
devotion in the Pagan world. [104] A magnificent temple rose in honor
of the god of light; and his colossal figure [105] almost filled the
capacious sanctuary, which was enriched with gold and gems, and adorned
by the skill of the Grecian artists. The deity was represented in a
bending attitude, with a golden cup in his hand, pouring out a libation
on the earth; as if he supplicated the venerable mother to give to
his arms the cold and beauteous Daphne: for the spot was ennobled by
fiction; and the fancy of the Syrian poets had transported the amorous
tale from the banks of the Peneus to those of the Orontes. The ancient
rites of Greece were imitated by the royal colony of Antioch. A stream
of prophecy, which rivalled the truth and reputation of the Delphic
oracle, flowed from the Castalian fountain of Daphne. [106] In the
adjacent fields a stadium was built by a special privilege, [107] which
had been purchased from Elis; the Olympic games were celebrated at the
expense of the city; and a revenue of thirty thousand pounds sterling
was annually applied to the public pleasures. [108] The perpetual resort
of pilgrims and spectators insensibly formed, in the neighborhood of the
temple, the stately and populous village of Daphne, which emulated the
splendor, without acquiring the title, of a provincial city. The temple
and the village were deeply bosomed in a thick grove of laurels and
cypresses, which reached as far as a circumference of ten miles, and
formed in the most sultry summers a cool and impenetrable shade. A
thousand streams of the purest water, issuing from every hill, preserved
the verdure of the earth, and the temperature of the air; the senses
were gratified with harmonious sounds and aromatic odors; and the
peaceful grove was consecrated to health and joy, to luxury and love.
The vigorous youth pursued, like Apollo, the object of his desires; and
the blushing maid was warned, by the fate of Daphne, to shun the folly
of unseasonable coyness. The soldier and the philosopher wisely avoided
the temptation of this sensual paradise: [109] where pleasure, assuming
the character of religion, imperceptibly dissolved the firmness of manly
virtue. But the groves of Daphne continued for many ages to enjoy the
veneration of natives and strangers; the privileges of the holy ground
were enlarged by the munificence of succeeding emperors; and every
generation added new ornaments to the splendor of the temple. [110]

[Footnote 104: The grove and temple of Daphne are described by Strabo,
(l. xvi. p. 1089, 1090, edit. Amstel. 1707,) Libanius, (Naenia, p.
185-188. Antiochic. Orat. xi. p. 380, 381,) and Sozomen, (l. v. c.
19.) Wesseling (Itinerar. p. 581) and Casaubon (ad Hist. August. p. 64)
illustrate this curious subject.]

and his bulk was consequently equal to that of a thousand men. See a

p. 198.)]

[Footnote 106: Hadrian read the history of his future fortunes on a
leaf dipped in the Castalian stream; a trick which, according to the
physician Vandale, (de Oraculis, p. 281, 282,) might be easily performed
by chemical preparations. The emperor stopped the source of such
dangerous knowledge; which was again opened by the devout curiosity of
Julian.]

Antioch, (Noris. Epoch. Syro-Maced. p. 139-174,) for the term of
ninety Olympiads. But the Olympic games of Antioch were not regularly
celebrated till the reign of Commodus. See the curious details in the
Chronicle of John Malala, (tom. i. p. 290, 320, 372-381,) a writer whose
merit and authority are confined within the limits of his native city.]

Antoninus in an original letter preserved by his biographer in Hist.

at Daphne.]

When Julian, on the day of the annual festival, hastened to adore
the Apollo of Daphne, his devotion was raised to the highest pitch
of eagerness and impatience. His lively imagination anticipated the
grateful pomp of victims, of libations and of incense; a long procession
of youths and virgins, clothed in white robes, the symbol of their
innocence; and the tumultuous concourse of an innumerable people. But
the zeal of Antioch was diverted, since the reign of Christianity, into
a different channel. Instead of hecatombs of fat oxen sacrificed by the
tribes of a wealthy city to their tutelar deity the emperor complains
that he found only a single goose, provided at the expense of a priest,
the pale and solitary in habitant of this decayed temple. [111] The
altar was deserted, the oracle had been reduced to silence, and the holy
ground was profaned by the introduction of Christian and funereal rites.
After Babylas [112] (a bishop of Antioch, who died in prison in the
persecution of Decius) had rested near a century in his grave, his body,
by the order of Caesar Gallus, was transported into the midst of the
grove of Daphne. A magnificent church was erected over his remains;
a portion of the sacred lands was usurped for the maintenance of the
clergy, and for the burial of the Christians at Antioch, who were
ambitious of lying at the feet of their bishop; and the priests of
Apollo retired, with their affrighted and indignant votaries. As soon as
another revolution seemed to restore the fortune of Paganism, the church
of St. Babylas was demolished, and new buildings were added to the
mouldering edifice which had been raised by the piety of Syrian kings.
But the first and most serious care of Julian was to deliver his
oppressed deity from the odious presence of the dead and living
Christians, who had so effectually suppressed the voice of fraud or
enthusiasm. [113] The scene of infection was purified, according to
the forms of ancient rituals; the bodies were decently removed; and
the ministers of the church were permitted to convey the remains of
St. Babylas to their former habitation within the walls of Antioch.
The modest behavior which might have assuaged the jealousy of a
hostile government was neglected, on this occasion, by the zeal of the
Christians. The lofty car, that transported the relics of Babylas, was
followed, and accompanied, and received, by an innumerable multitude;
who chanted, with thundering acclamations, the Psalms of David the most
expressive of their contempt for idols and idolaters. The return of the
saint was a triumph; and the triumph was an insult on the religion of
the emperor, who exerted his pride to dissemble his resentment. During
the night which terminated this indiscreet procession, the temple of
Daphne was in flames; the statue of Apollo was consumed; and the
walls of the edifice were left a naked and awful monument of ruin. The
Christians of Antioch asserted, with religious confidence, that the
powerful intercession of St. Babylas had pointed the lightnings of
heaven against the devoted roof: but as Julian was reduced to the
alternative of believing either a crime or a miracle, he chose, without
hesitation, without evidence, but with some color of probability, to
impute the fire of Daphne to the revenge of the Galilaeans. [114] Their
offence, had it been sufficiently proved, might have justified the
retaliation, which was immediately executed by the order of Julian, of
shutting the doors, and confiscating the wealth, of the cathedral of
Antioch. To discover the criminals who were guilty of the tumult, of
the fire, or of secreting the riches of the church, several of the
ecclesiastics were tortured; [115] and a Presbyter, of the name of
Theodoret, was beheaded by the sentence of the Count of the East. But
this hasty act was blamed by the emperor; who lamented, with real or
affected concern, that the imprudent zeal of his ministers would tarnish
his reign with the disgrace of persecution. [116]

[Footnote 111: Julian (Misopogon, p. 367, 362) discovers his own
character with naivete, that unconscious simplicity which always
constitutes genuine humor.]

[Footnote 112: Babylas is named by Eusebius in the succession of the
bishops of Antioch, (Hist. Eccles. l. vi. c. 29, 39.) His triumph over
two emperors (the first fabulous, the second historical) is diffusely
celebrated by Chrysostom, (tom. ii. p. 536-579, edit. Montfaucon.)
Tillemont (Mem. Eccles. tom. iii. part ii. p. 287-302, 459-465) becomes
almost a sceptic.]

[Footnote 113: Ecclesiastical critics, particularly those who love
relics, exult in the confession of Julian (Misopogon, p. 361) and
Libanius, (Laenia, p. 185,) that Apollo was disturbed by the vicinity
of one dead man. Yet Ammianus (xxii. 12) clears and purifies the whole
ground, according to the rites which the Athenians formerly practised in
the Isle of Delos.]

[Footnote 114: Julian (in Misopogon, p. 361) rather insinuates, than
affirms, their guilt. Ammianus (xxii. 13) treats the imputation as
levissimus rumor, and relates the story with extraordinary candor.]

[Footnote 115: Quo tam atroci casu repente consumpto, ad id usque
e imperatoris ira provexit, ut quaestiones agitare juberet solito
acriores, (yet Julian blames the lenity of the magistrates of Antioch,)
et majorem ecclesiam Antiochiae claudi. This interdiction was performed
with some circumstances of indignity and profanation; and the seasonable
death of the principal actor, Julian's uncle, is related with much
superstitious complacency by the Abbe de la Bleterie. Vie de Julien, p.
362-369.]

[Footnote 116: Besides the ecclesiastical historians, who are more or
less to be suspected, we may allege the passion of St. Theodore, in the
Acta Sincera of Ruinart, p. 591. The complaint of Julian gives it an
original and authentic air.]
