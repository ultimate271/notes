## Chapter XXIV: The Retreat And Death Of Julian.--Part II.

The martial impatience of Julian urged him to take the field in the
beginning of the spring; and he dismissed, with contempt and reproach,
the senate of Antioch, who accompanied the emperor beyond the limits of
their own territory, to which he was resolved never to return. After a
laborious march of two days, [29] he halted on the third at Beraea,
or Aleppo, where he had the mortification of finding a senate almost
entirely Christian; who received with cold and formal demonstrations of
respect the eloquent sermon of the apostle of paganism. The son of one
of the most illustrious citizens of Beraea, who had embraced,
either from interest or conscience, the religion of the emperor, was
disinherited by his angry parent. The father and the son were invited
to the Imperial table. Julian, placing himself between them, attempted,
without success, to inculcate the lesson and example of toleration;
supported, with affected calmness, the indiscreet zeal of the aged
Christian, who seemed to forget the sentiments of nature, and the duty
of a subject; and at length, turning towards the afflicted youth, "Since
you have lost a father," said he, "for my sake, it is incumbent on me to
supply his place." [30] The emperor was received in a manner much more
agreeable to his wishes at Batnae, [30a] a small town pleasantly seated
in a grove of cypresses, about twenty miles from the city of Hierapolis.
The solemn rites of sacrifice were decently prepared by the inhabitants
of Batnae, who seemed attached to the worship of their tutelar deities,
Apollo and Jupiter; but the serious piety of Julian was offended by the
tumult of their applause; and he too clearly discerned, that the smoke
which arose from their altars was the incense of flattery, rather than
of devotion. The ancient and magnificent temple which had sanctified,
for so many ages, the city of Hierapolis, [31] no longer subsisted; and
the consecrated wealth, which afforded a liberal maintenance to more
than three hundred priests, might hasten its downfall. Yet Julian
enjoyed the satisfaction of embracing a philosopher and a friend, whose
religious firmness had withstood the pressing and repeated solicitations
of Constantius and Gallus, as often as those princes lodged at his
house, in their passage through Hierapolis. In the hurry of military
preparation, and the careless confidence of a familiar correspondence,
the zeal of Julian appears to have been lively and uniform. He had now
undertaken an important and difficult war; and the anxiety of the event
rendered him still more attentive to observe and register the most
trifling presages, from which, according to the rules of divination, any
knowledge of futurity could be derived. [32] He informed Libanius of
his progress as far as Hierapolis, by an elegant epistle, [33] which
displays the facility of his genius, and his tender friendship for the
sophist of Antioch.

[Footnote 29: From Antioch to Litarbe, on the territory of Chalcis, the
road, over hills and through morasses, was extremely bad; and the loose
stones were cemented only with sand, (Julian. epist. xxvii.) It
is singular enough that the Romans should have neglected the great
communication between Antioch and the Euphrates. See Wesseling Itinerar.
p. 190 Bergier, Hist des Grands Chemins, tom. ii. p. 100]

[Footnote 30: Julian alludes to this incident, (epist. xxvii.,) which
is more distinctly related by Theodoret, (l. iii. c. 22.) The intolerant
spirit of the father is applauded by Tillemont, (Hist. des Empereurs,
tom. iv. p. 534.) and even by La Bleterie, (Vie de Julien, p. 413.)]

[Footnote 30a: This name, of Syriac origin, is found in the Arabic, and
means a place in a valley where waters meet. Julian says, the name of
the city is Barbaric, the situation Greek. The geographer Abulfeda (tab.
Syriac. p. 129, edit. Koehler) speaks of it in a manner to justify the
praises of Julian.--St. Martin. Notes to Le Beau, iii. 56.--M.]

[Footnote 31: See the curious treatise de Dea Syria, inserted among
the works of Lucian, (tom. iii. p. 451-490, edit. Reitz.) The singular
appellation of Ninus vetus (Ammian. xiv. 8) might induce a suspicion,
that Heirapolis had been the royal seat of the Assyrians.]

[Footnote 32: Julian (epist. xxviii.) kept a regular account of all
the fortunate omens; but he suppresses the inauspicious signs, which
Ammianus (xxiii. 2) has carefully recorded.]

[Footnote 33: Julian. epist. xxvii. p. 399-402.]

Hierapolis, [33a] situate almost on the banks of the Euphrates, [34]
had been appointed for the general rendezvous of the Roman troops,
who immediately passed the great river on a bridge of boats, which was
previously constructed. [35] If the inclinations of Julian had been
similar to those of his predecessor, he might have wasted the active
and important season of the year in the circus of Samosata or in the
churches of Edessa. But as the warlike emperor, instead of Constantius,
had chosen Alexander for his model, he advanced without delay to
Carrhae, [36] a very ancient city of Mesopotamia, at the distance of
fourscore miles from Hierapolis. The temple of the Moon attracted the
devotion of Julian; but the halt of a few days was principally employed
in completing the immense preparations of the Persian war. The secret of
the expedition had hitherto remained in his own breast; but as Carrhae
is the point of separation of the two great roads, he could no longer
conceal whether it was his design to attack the dominions of Sapor
on the side of the Tigris, or on that of the Euphrates. The emperor
detached an army of thirty thousand men, under the command of his
kinsman Procopius, and of Sebastian, who had been duke of Egypt. They
were ordered to direct their march towards Nisibis, and to secure
the frontier from the desultory incursions of the enemy, before they
attempted the passage of the Tigris. Their subsequent operations were
left to the discretion of the generals; but Julian expected, that after
wasting with fire and sword the fertile districts of Media and Adiabene,
they might arrive under the walls of Ctesiphon at the same time that he
himself, advancing with equal steps along the banks of the Euphrates,
should besiege the capital of the Persian monarchy. The success of this
well-concerted plan depended, in a great measure, on the powerful and
ready assistance of the king of Armenia, who, without exposing the
safety of his own dominions, might detach an army of four thousand
horse, and twenty thousand foot, to the assistance of the Romans. [37]
But the feeble Arsaces Tiranus, [38] king of Armenia, had degenerated
still more shamefully than his father Chosroes, from the manly virtues
of the great Tiridates; and as the pusillanimous monarch was averse
to any enterprise of danger and glory, he could disguise his timid
indolence by the more decent excuses of religion and gratitude. He
expressed a pious attachment to the memory of Constantius, from whose
hands he had received in marriage Olympias, the daughter of the praefect
Ablavius; and the alliance of a female, who had been educated as
the destined wife of the emperor Constans, exalted the dignity of
a Barbarian king. [39] Tiranus professed the Christian religion; he
reigned over a nation of Christians; and he was restrained, by every
principle of conscience and interest, from contributing to the victory,
which would consummate the ruin of the church. The alienated mind of
Tiranus was exasperated by the indiscretion of Julian, who treated the
king of Armenia as his slave, and as the enemy of the gods. The haughty
and threatening style of the Imperial mandates [40] awakened the secret
indignation of a prince, who, in the humiliating state of dependence,
was still conscious of his royal descent from the Arsacides, the lords
of the East, and the rivals of the Roman power. [40a]

[Footnote 38: Moses of Chorene (Hist. Armeniac. l. iii. c. 11, p.
242) fixes his accession (A. D. 354) to the 17th year of Constantius.
----Arsaces Tiranus, or Diran, had ceased to reign twenty-five years
before, in 337. The intermediate changes in Armenia, and the character
of this Arsaces, the son of Diran, are traced by M. St. Martin, at
considerable length, in his supplement to Le Beau, ii. 208-242. As long
as his Grecian queen Olympias maintained her influence, Arsaces was
faithful to the Roman and Christian alliance. On the accession of
Julian, the same influence made his fidelity to waver; but Olympias
having been poisoned in the sacramental bread by the agency of
Pharandcem, the former wife of Arsaces, another change took place in
Armenian politics unfavorable to the Christian interest. The patriarch
Narses retired from the impious court to a safe seclusion. Yet
Pharandsem was equally hostile to the Persian influence, and Arsaces
began to support with vigor the cause of Julian. He made an inroad into
the Persian dominions with a body of Rans and Alans as auxiliaries;
wasted Aderbidgan and Sapor, who had been defeated near Tauriz, was
engaged in making head against his troops in Persarmenia, at the time of
the death of Julian. Such is M. St. Martin's view, (ii. 276, et sqq.,)
which rests on the Armenian historians, Faustos of Byzantium, and Mezrob
the biographer of the Partriarch Narses. In the history of Armenia
by Father Chamitch, and translated by Avdall, Tiran is still king of
Armenia, at the time of Julian's death. F. Chamitch follows Moses of
Chorene, The authority of Gibbon.--M.]

in general terms, that Constantius gave to his brother's widow, an
expression more suitable to a Roman than a Christian.]

occasion, monuerat. Muratori (Fabricius, Bibliothec. Graec. tom. vii. p.

vulgar, and (though it might deceive Sozomen, l. vi. c. 5) most probably
spurious. La Bleterie (Hist. de Jovien, tom. ii. p. 339) translates and
rejects it. Note: St. Martin considers it genuine: the Armenian writers
mention such a letter, iii. 37.--M.]

[Footnote 40a: Arsaces did not abandon the Roman alliance, but gave it
only feeble support. St. Martin, iii. 41--M.]

The military dispositions of Julian were skilfully contrived to deceive
the spies and to divert the attention of Sapor. The legions appeared
to direct their march towards Nisibis and the Tigris. On a sudden they
wheeled to the right; traversed the level and naked plain of Carrhae;
and reached, on the third day, the banks of the Euphrates, where the
strong town of Nicephorium, or Callinicum, had been founded by the
Macedonian kings. From thence the emperor pursued his march, above
ninety miles, along the winding stream of the Euphrates, till, at
length, about one month after his departure from Antioch, he discovered
the towers of Circesium, [40b] the extreme limit of the Roman dominions.
The army of Julian, the most numerous that any of the Caesars had ever
led against Persia, consisted of sixty-five thousand effective and
well-disciplined soldiers. The veteran bands of cavalry and infantry, of
Romans and Barbarians, had been selected from the different provinces;
and a just preeminence of loyalty and valor was claimed by the hardy
Gauls, who guarded the throne and person of their beloved prince.
A formidable body of Scythian auxiliaries had been transported from
another climate, and almost from another world, to invade a distant
country, of whose name and situation they were ignorant. The love
of rapine and war allured to the Imperial standard several tribes of
Saracens, or roving Arabs, whose service Julian had commanded, while
he sternly refuse the payment of the accustomed subsidies. The broad
channel of the Euphrates [41] was crowded by a fleet of eleven hundred
ships, destined to attend the motions, and to satisfy the wants, of the
Roman army. The military strength of the fleet was composed of fifty
armed galleys; and these were accompanied by an equal number of
flat-bottomed boats, which might occasionally be connected into the
form of temporary bridges. The rest of the ships, partly constructed
of timber, and partly covered with raw hides, were laden with an almost
inexhaustible supply of arms and engines, of utensils and provisions.
The vigilant humanity of Julian had embarked a very large magazine of
vinegar and biscuit for the use of the soldiers, but he prohibited the
indulgence of wine; and rigorously stopped a long string of superfluous
camels that attempted to follow the rear of the army. The River Chaboras
falls into the Euphrates at Circesium; [42] and as soon as the trumpet
gave the signal of march, the Romans passed the little stream which
separated two mighty and hostile empires. The custom of ancient
discipline required a military oration; and Julian embraced every
opportunity of displaying his eloquence. He animated the impatient and
attentive legions by the example of the inflexible courage and glorious
triumphs of their ancestors. He excited their resentment by a lively
picture of the insolence of the Persians; and he exhorted them to
imitate his firm resolution, either to extirpate that perfidious nation,
or to devote his life in the cause of the republic. The eloquence of
Julian was enforced by a donative of one hundred and thirty pieces of
silver to every soldier; and the bridge of the Chaboras was instantly
cut away, to convince the troops that they must place their hopes of
safety in the success of their arms. Yet the prudence of the emperor
induced him to secure a remote frontier, perpetually exposed to the
inroads of the hostile Arabs. A detachment of four thousand men was
left at Circesium, which completed, to the number of ten thousand, the
regular garrison of that important fortress. [43]

i. p. 41, edit. Hutchinson, with Foster's Observations, p. 29, &c., in
the 2d volume of Spelman's translation.) If the breadth of the Euphrates
at Bir and Zeugma is no more than 130 yards, (Voyages de Niebuhr, tom.
ii. p. 335,) the enormous difference must chiefly arise from the depth
of the channel.]

From the moment that the Romans entered the enemy's country, [44] the
country of an active and artful enemy, the order of march was disposed
in three columns. [45] The strength of the infantry, and consequently of
the whole army was placed in the centre, under the peculiar command
of their master-general Victor. On the right, the brave Nevitta led a
column of several legions along the banks of the Euphrates, and almost
always in sight of the fleet. The left flank of the army was protected
by the column of cavalry. Hormisdas and Arinthaeus were appointed
generals of the horse; and the singular adventures of Hormisdas [46]
are not undeserving of our notice. He was a Persian prince, of the royal
race of the Sassanides, who, in the troubles of the minority of
Sapor, had escaped from prison to the hospitable court of the great
Constantine. Hormisdas at first excited the compassion, and at length
acquired the esteem, of his new masters; his valor and fidelity raised
him to the military honors of the Roman service; and though a Christian,
he might indulge the secret satisfaction of convincing his ungrateful
country, than at oppressed subject may prove the most dangerous enemy.
Such was the disposition of the three principal columns. The front and
flanks of the army were covered by Lucilianus with a flying detachment
of fifteen hundred light-armed soldiers, whose active vigilance observed
the most distant signs, and conveyed the earliest notice, of any hostile
approach. Dagalaiphus, and Secundinus duke of Osrhoene, conducted
the troops of the rear-guard; the baggage securely proceeded in the
intervals of the columns; and the ranks, from a motive either of use
or ostentation, were formed in such open order, that the whole line of
march extended almost ten miles. The ordinary post of Julian was at the
head of the centre column; but as he preferred the duties of a general
to the state of a monarch, he rapidly moved, with a small escort of
light cavalry, to the front, the rear, the flanks, wherever his presence
could animate or protect the march of the Roman army. The country which
they traversed from the Chaboras, to the cultivated lands of Assyria,
may be considered as a part of the desert of Arabia, a dry and barren
waste, which could never be improved by the most powerful arts of human
industry. Julian marched over the same ground which had been trod above
seven hundred years before by the footsteps of the younger Cyrus, and
which is described by one of the companions of his expedition, the sage
and heroic Xenophon. [47] "The country was a plain throughout, as even
as the sea, and full of wormwood; and if any other kind of shrubs or
reeds grew there, they had all an aromatic smell, but no trees could be
seen. Bustards and ostriches, antelopes and wild asses, [48] appeared
to be the only inhabitants of the desert; and the fatigues of the march
were alleviated by the amusements of the chase." The loose sand of the
desert was frequently raised by the wind into clouds of dust; and a
great number of the soldiers of Julian, with their tents, were suddenly
thrown to the ground by the violence of an unexpected hurricane.

[Footnote 44: Before he enters Persia, Ammianus copiously describes
(xxiii. p. 396-419, edit. Gronov. in 4to.) the eighteen great provinces,
(as far as the Seric, or Chinese frontiers,) which were subject to the
Sassanides.]

[Footnote 45: Ammianus (xxiv. 1) and Zosimus (l. iii. p. 162, 163)
rately expressed the order of march.]

[Footnote 46: The adventures of Hormisdas are related with some mixture
of fable, (Zosimus, l. ii. p. 100-102; Tillemont, Hist. des Empereurs
tom. iv. p. 198.) It is almost impossible that he should be the brother
(frater germanus) of an eldest and posthumous child: nor do I recollect
that Ammianus ever gives him that title. * Note: St. Martin conceives
that he was an elder brother by another mother who had several children,
ii. 24--M.]

[Footnote 47: See the first book of the Anabasis, p. 45, 46. This
pleasing work is original and authentic. Yet Xenophon's memory, perhaps
many years after the expedition, has sometimes betrayed him; and the
distances which he marks are often larger than either a soldier or a
geographer will allow.]

[Footnote 48: Mr. Spelman, the English translator of the Anabasis, (vol.
i. p. 51,) confounds the antelope with the roebuck, and the wild ass
with the zebra.]

The sandy plains of Mesopotamia were abandoned to the antelopes and wild
asses of the desert; but a variety of populous towns and villages were
pleasantly situated on the banks of the Euphrates, and in the islands
which are occasionally formed by that river. The city of Annah, or
Anatho, [49] the actual residence of an Arabian emir, is composed of
two long streets, which enclose, within a natural fortification, a
small island in the midst, and two fruitful spots on either side, of
the Euphrates. The warlike inhabitants of Anatho showed a disposition
to stop the march of a Roman emperor; till they were diverted from such
fatal presumption by the mild exhortations of Prince Hormisdas, and
the approaching terrors of the fleet and army. They implored, and
experienced, the clemency of Julian, who transplanted the people to an
advantageous settlement, near Chalcis in Syria, and admitted Pusaeus,
the governor, to an honorable rank in his service and friendship. But
the impregnable fortress of Thilutha could scorn the menace of a
siege; and the emperor was obliged to content himself with an insulting
promise, that, when he had subdued the interior provinces of Persia,
Thilutha would no longer refuse to grace the triumph of the emperor. The
inhabitants of the open towns, unable to resist, and unwilling to
yield, fled with precipitation; and their houses, filled with spoil
and provisions, were occupied by the soldiers of Julian, who massacred,
without remorse and without punishment, some defenceless women. During
the march, the Surenas, [49a] or Persian general, and Malek Rodosaces,
the renowned emir of the tribe of Gassan, [50] incessantly hovered
round the army; every straggler was intercepted; every detachment was
attacked; and the valiant Hormisdas escaped with some difficulty from
their hands. But the Barbarians were finally repulsed; the country
became every day less favorable to the operations of cavalry; and when
the Romans arrived at Macepracta, they perceived the ruins of the wall,
which had been constructed by the ancient kings of Assyria, to secure
their dominions from the incursions of the Medes. These preliminaries of
the expedition of Julian appear to have employed about fifteen days; and
we may compute near three hundred miles from the fortress of Circesium
to the wall of Macepracta. [1]

travellers seldom possess any previous knowledge of the countries which
they visit. Shaw and Tournefort deserve an honorable exception.]

family. St. Martin, iii. 79.--M.]

[Footnote 50: Famosi nominis latro, says Ammianus; a high encomium
for an Arab. The tribe of Gassan had settled on the edge of Syria, and
reigned some time in Damascus, under a dynasty of thirty-one kings, or
emirs, from the time of Pompey to that of the Khalif Omar. D'Herbelot,
Bibliotheque Orientale, p. 360. Pococke, Specimen Hist. Arabicae,
p. 75-78. The name of Rodosaces does not appear in the list. * Note:
Rodosaces-malek is king. St. Martin considers that Gibbon has fallen
into an error in bringing the tribe of Gassan to the Euphrates. In
Ammianus it is Assan. M. St. Martin would read Massanitarum, the same
with the Mauzanitae of Malala.--M.]

Chaldaic has relation to its position; it easily bears the signification
of the division of the waters. M. St. M. considers it the Missice of
Pliny, v. 26. St. Martin, iii. 83.--M.]

The fertile province of Assyria, [52] which stretched beyond the Tigris,
as far as the mountains of Media, [53] extended about four hundred miles
from the ancient wall of Macepracta, to the territory of Basra, where
the united streams of the Euphrates and Tigris discharge themselves into
the Persian Gulf. [54] The whole country might have claimed the peculiar
name of Mesopotamia; as the two rivers, which are never more distant
than fifty, approach, between Bagdad and Babylon, within twenty-five
miles, of each other. A multitude of artificial canals, dug without much
labor in a soft and yielding soil connected the rivers, and intersected
the plain of Assyria. The uses of these artificial canals were various
and important. They served to discharge the superfluous waters from one
river into the other, at the season of their respective inundations.
Subdividing themselves into smaller and smaller branches, they refreshed
the dry lands, and supplied the deficiency of rain. They facilitated the
intercourse of peace and commerce; and, as the dams could be speedily
broke down, they armed the despair of the Assyrians with the means of
opposing a sudden deluge to the progress of an invading army. To the
soil and climate of Assyria, nature had denied some of her choicest
gifts, the vine, the olive, and the fig-tree; [54a] but the food which
supports the life of man, and particularly wheat and barley, were
produced with inexhaustible fertility; and the husbandman, who committed
his seed to the earth, was frequently rewarded with an increase of two,
or even of three, hundred. The face of the country was interspersed
with groves of innumerable palm-trees; [55] and the diligent natives
celebrated, either in verse or prose, the three hundred and sixty uses
to which the trunk, the branches, the leaves, the juice, and the fruit,
were skilfully applied. Several manufactures, especially those of
leather and linen, employed the industry of a numerous people, and
afforded valuable materials for foreign trade; which appears, however,
to have been conducted by the hands of strangers. Babylon had been
converted into a royal park; but near the ruins of the ancient capital,
new cities had successively arisen, and the populousness of the country
was displayed in the multitude of towns and villages, which were built
of bricks dried in the sun, and strongly cemented with bitumen; the
natural and peculiar production of the Babylonian soil. While the
successors of Cyrus reigned over Asia, the province of Syria alone
maintained, during a third part of the year, the luxurious plenty of the
table and household of the Great King. Four considerable villages
were assigned for the subsistence of his Indian dogs; eight hundred
stallions, and sixteen thousand mares, were constantly kept, at the
expense of the country, for the royal stables; and as the daily tribute,
which was paid to the satrap, amounted to one English bushe of silver,
we may compute the annual revenue of Assyria at more than twelve hundred
thousand pounds sterling. [56]

[Footnote 52: The description of Assyria, is furnished by Herodotus, (l.
i. c. 192, &c.,) who sometimes writes for children, and sometimes
for philosophers; by Strabo, (l. xvi. p. 1070-1082,) and by Ammianus,
(l.xxiii. c. 6.) The most useful of the modern travellers are Tavernier,
(part i. l. ii. p. 226-258,) Otter, (tom. ii. p. 35-69, and 189-224,)
and Niebuhr, (tom. ii. p. 172-288.) Yet I much regret that the Irak
Arabi of Abulfeda has not been translated.]

[Footnote 53: Ammianus remarks, that the primitive Assyria, which
comprehended Ninus, (Nineveh,) and Arbela, had assumed the more recent
and peculiar appellation of Adiabene; and he seems to fix Teredon,
Vologesia, and Apollonia, as the extreme cities of the actual province
of Assyria.]

[Footnote 54: The two rivers unite at Apamea, or Corna, (one hundred
miles from the Persian Gulf,) into the broad stream of the Pasitigris,
or Shutul-Arab. The Euphrates formerly reached the sea by a separate
channel, which was obstructed and diverted by the citizens of Orchoe,
about twenty miles to the south-east of modern Basra. (D'Anville, in the
Memoires de l'Acad. des Inscriptions, tom.xxx. p. 171-191.)]

[Footnote 54a: We are informed by Mr. Gibbon, that nature has denied to
the soil an climate of Assyria some of her choicest gifts, the vine,
the olive, and the fig-tree. This might have been the case ir the age of
Ammianus Marcellinus, but it is not so at the present day; and it is a
curious fact that the grape, the olive, and the fig, are the most common
fruits in the province, and may be seen in every garden. Macdonald
Kinneir, Geogr. Mem. on Persia 239--M.]

[Footnote 55: The learned Kaempfer, as a botanist, an antiquary, and a
traveller, has exhausted (Amoenitat. Exoticae, Fasicul. iv. p. 660-764)
the whole subject of palm-trees.]

[Footnote 56: Assyria yielded to the Persian satrap an Artaba of silver
each day. The well-known proportion of weights and measures (see Bishop
Hooper's elaborate Inquiry,) the specific gravity of water and silver,
and the value of that metal, will afford, after a short process, the
annual revenue which I have stated. Yet the Great King received no
more than 1000 Euboic, or Tyrian, talents (252,000l.) from Assyria.
The comparison of two passages in Herodotus, (l. i. c. 192, l. iii. c.
89-96) reveals an important difference between the gross, and the net,
revenue of Persia; the sums paid by the province, and the gold or silver
deposited in the royal treasure. The monarch might annually save three
millions six hundred thousand pounds, of the seventeen or eighteen
millions raised upon the people.]
