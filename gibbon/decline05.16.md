## Chapter LI: Conquests By The Arabs.--Part II.

After the defeat of Cadesia, a country intersected by rivers and canals
might have opposed an insuperable barrier to the victorious cavalry; and
the walls of Ctesiphon or Madayn, which had resisted the battering-rams
of the Romans, would not have yielded to the darts of the Saracens. But
the flying Persians were overcome by the belief, that the last day
of their religion and empire was at hand; the strongest posts were
abandoned by treachery or cowardice; and the king, with a part of his
family and treasures, escaped to Holwan at the foot of the Median hills.

In the third month after the battle, Said, the lieutenant of Omar,
passed the Tigris without opposition; the capital was taken by assault;
and the disorderly resistance of the people gave a keener edge to the
sabres of the Moslems, who shouted with religious transport, "This is
the white palace of Chosroes; this is the promise of the apostle of
God!" The naked robbers of the desert were suddenly enriched beyond the
measure of their hope or knowledge. Each chamber revealed a new treasure
secreted with art, or ostentatiously displayed; the gold and silver, the
various wardrobes and precious furniture, surpassed (says Abulfeda) the
estimate of fancy or numbers; and another historian defines the untold
and almost infinite mass, by the fabulous computation of three thousands
of thousands of thousands of pieces of gold. [24] Some minute though
curious facts represent the contrast of riches and ignorance. From the
remote islands of the Indian Ocean a large provision of camphire [25]
had been imported, which is employed with a mixture of wax to illuminate
the palaces of the East. Strangers to the name and properties of that
odoriferous gum, the Saracens, mistaking it for salt, mingled the
camphire in their bread, and were astonished at the bitterness of the
taste. One of the apartments of the palace was decorated with a carpet
of silk, sixty cubits in length, and as many in breadth: a paradise or
garden was depictured on the ground: the flowers, fruits, and shrubs,
were imitated by the figures of the gold embroidery, and the colors of
the precious stones; and the ample square was encircled by a variegated
and verdant border. [251] The Arabian general persuaded his soldiers
to relinquish their claim, in the reasonable hope that the eyes of the
caliph would be delighted with the splendid workmanship of nature and
industry. Regardless of the merit of art, and the pomp of royalty, the
rigid Omar divided the prize among his brethren of Medina: the picture
was destroyed; but such was the intrinsic value of the materials, that
the share of Ali alone was sold for twenty thousand drams. A mule that
carried away the tiara and cuirass, the belt and bracelets of Chosroes,
was overtaken by the pursuers; the gorgeous trophy was presented to
the commander of the faithful; and the gravest of the companions
condescended to smile when they beheld the white beard, the hairy arms,
and uncouth figure of the veteran, who was invested with the spoils of
the Great King. [26] The sack of Ctesiphon was followed by its desertion
and gradual decay. The Saracens disliked the air and situation of
the place, and Omar was advised by his general to remove the seat of
government to the western side of the Euphrates. In every age, the
foundation and ruin of the Assyrian cities has been easy and rapid: the
country is destitute of stone and timber; and the most solid structures
[27] are composed of bricks baked in the sun, and joined by a cement
of the native bitumen. The name of Cufa [28] describes a habitation of
reeds and earth; but the importance of the new capital was supported
by the numbers, wealth, and spirit, of a colony of veterans; and their
licentiousness was indulged by the wisest caliphs, who were apprehensive
of provoking the revolt of a hundred thousand swords: "Ye men of Cufa,"
said Ali, who solicited their aid, "you have been always conspicuous by
your valor. You conquered the Persian king, and scattered his forces,
till you had taken possession of his inheritance." This mighty conquest
was achieved by the battles of Jalula and Nehavend. After the loss of
the former, Yezdegerd fled from Holwan, and concealed his shame and
despair in the mountains of Farsistan, from whence Cyrus had descended
with his equal and valiant companions. The courage of the nation
survived that of the monarch: among the hills to the south of Ecbatana
or Hamadan, one hundred and fifty thousand Persians made a third and
final stand for their religion and country; and the decisive battle of
Nehavend was styled by the Arabs the victory of victories. If it be true
that the flying general of the Persians was stopped and overtaken in a
crowd of mules and camels laden with honey, the incident, however slight
and singular, will denote the luxurious impediments of an Oriental army.

nostris cesserint. Abulfeda, p. 69. Yet I still suspect, that the
extravagant numbers of Elmacin may be the error, not of the text, but of
the version. The best translators from the Greek, for instance, I find
to be very poor arithmeticians. * Note: Ockley (Hist. of Saracens,
vol. i. p. 230) translates in the same manner three thousand million of
ducats. See Forster's Mahometanism Unveiled, vol. ii. p. 462; who
makes this innocent doubt of Gibbon, in which, is to the amount of
the plunder, I venture to concur, a grave charge of inaccuracy and
disrespect to the memory of Erpenius. The Persian authorities of
Price (p. 122) make the booty worth three hundred and thirty millions
sterling!--M]

The geography of Persia is darkly delineated by the Greeks and Latins;
but the most illustrious of her cities appear to be more ancient than
the invasion of the Arabs. By the reduction of Hamadan and Ispahan, of
Caswin, Tauris, and Rei, they gradually approached the shores of the
Caspian Sea: and the orators of Mecca might applaud the success and
spirit of the faithful, who had already lost sight of the northern
bear, and had almost transcended the bounds of the habitable world. [30]
Again, turning towards the West and the Roman empire, they repassed
the Tigris over the bridge of Mosul, and, in the captive provinces
of Armenia and Mesopotamia, embraced their victorious brethren of the
Syrian army. From the palace of Madayn their Eastern progress was not
less rapid or extensive. They advanced along the Tigris and the Gulf;
penetrated through the passes of the mountains into the valley of
Estachar or Persepolis, and profaned the last sanctuary of the Magian
empire. The grandson of Chosroes was nearly surprised among the falling
columns and mutilated figures; a sad emblem of the past and present
fortune of Persia: [31] he fled with accelerated haste over the desert
of Kirman, implored the aid of the warlike Segestans, and sought an
humble refuge on the verge of the Turkish and Chinese power. But a
victorious army is insensible of fatigue: the Arabs divided their forces
in the pursuit of a timorous enemy; and the caliph Othman promised the
government of Chorasan to the first general who should enter that
large and populous country, the kingdom of the ancient Bactrians. The
condition was accepted; the prize was deserved; the standard of Mahomet
was planted on the walls of Herat, Merou, and Balch; and the successful
leader neither halted nor reposed till his foaming cavalry had tasted
the waters of the Oxus. In the public anarchy, the independent governors
of the cities and castles obtained their separate capitulations: the
terms were granted or imposed by the esteem, the prudence, or the
compassion, of the victors; and a simple profession of faith established
the distinction between a brother and a slave. After a noble defence,
Harmozan, the prince or satrap of Ahwaz and Susa, was compelled to
surrender his person and his state to the discretion of the caliph;
and their interview exhibits a portrait of the Arabian manners. In the
presence, and by the command, of Omar, the gay Barbarian was despoiled
of his silken robes embroidered with gold, and of his tiara bedecked
with rubies and emeralds: "Are you now sensible," said the conqueror to
his naked captive--"are you now sensible of the judgment of God, and
of the different rewards of infidelity and obedience?" "Alas!" replied
Harmozan, "I feel them too deeply. In the days of our common ignorance,
we fought with the weapons of the flesh, and my nation was superior. God
was then neuter: since he has espoused your quarrel, you have subverted
our kingdom and religion." Oppressed by this painful dialogue,
the Persian complained of intolerable thirst, but discovered some
apprehension lest he should be killed whilst he was drinking a cup of
water. "Be of good courage," said the caliph; "your life is safe till
you have drunk this water:" the crafty satrap accepted the assurance,
and instantly dashed the vase against the ground. Omar would have
avenged the deceit, but his companions represented the sanctity of an
oath; and the speedy conversion of Harmozan entitled him not only to a
free pardon, but even to a stipend of two thousand pieces of gold.
The administration of Persia was regulated by an actual survey of the
people, the cattle, and the fruits of the earth; [32] and this monument,
which attests the vigilance of the caliphs, might have instructed the
philosophers of every age. [33]

[Footnote 30: It is in such a style of ignorance and wonder that the
Athenian orator describes the Arctic conquests of Alexander, who
never advanced beyond the shores of the Caspian. Aeschines contra

memorable cause was pleaded at Athens, Olymp. cxii. 3, (before Christ
330,) in the autumn, (Taylor, praefat. p. 370, &c.,) about a year after
the battle of Arbela; and Alexander, in the pursuit of Darius, was
marching towards Hyrcania and Bactriana.]

[Footnote 31: We are indebted for this curious particular to the
Dynasties of Abulpharagius, p. 116; but it is needless to prove the
identity of Estachar and Persepolis, (D'Herbelot, p. 327;) and still
more needless to copy the drawings and descriptions of Sir John Chardin,
or Corneillo le Bruyn.]

(Chronograph p. 283.)]

[Footnote 33: Amidst our meagre relations, I must regret that D'Herbelot
has not found and used a Persian translation of Tabari, enriched, as he
says, with many extracts from the native historians of the Ghebers or
Magi, (Bibliotheque Orientale, p. 1014.)]

The flight of Yezdegerd had carried him beyond the Oxus, and as far
as the Jaxartes, two rivers [34] of ancient and modern renown, which
descend from the mountains of India towards the Caspian Sea. He was
hospitably entertained by Takhan, prince of Fargana, [35] a fertile
province on the Jaxartes: the king of Samarcand, with the Turkish tribes
of Sogdiana and Scythia, were moved by the lamentations and promises of
the fallen monarch; and he solicited, by a suppliant embassy, the more
solid and powerful friendship of the emperor of China. [36] The virtuous
Taitsong, [37] the first of the dynasty of the Tang may be justly
compared with the Antonines of Rome: his people enjoyed the blessings
of prosperity and peace; and his dominion was acknowledged by forty-four
hordes of the Barbarians of Tartary. His last garrisons of Cashgar and
Khoten maintained a frequent intercourse with their neighbors of the
Jaxartes and Oxus; a recent colony of Persians had introduced into China
the astronomy of the Magi; and Taitsong might be alarmed by the rapid
progress and dangerous vicinity of the Arabs. The influence, and perhaps
the supplies, of China revived the hopes of Yezdegerd and the zeal
of the worshippers of fire; and he returned with an army of Turks to
conquer the inheritance of his fathers. The fortunate Moslems, without
unsheathing their swords, were the spectators of his ruin and death.
The grandson of Chosroes was betrayed by his servant, insulted by the
seditious inhabitants of Merou, and oppressed, defeated, and pursued by
his Barbarian allies. He reached the banks of a river, and offered his
rings and bracelets for an instant passage in a miller's boat. Ignorant
or insensible of royal distress, the rustic replied, that four drams of
silver were the daily profit of his mill, and that he would not suspend
his work unless the loss were repaid. In this moment of hesitation and
delay, the last of the Sassanian kings was overtaken and slaughtered by
the Turkish cavalry, in the nineteenth year of his unhappy reign. [38]
[3811] His son Firuz, an humble client of the Chinese emperor, accepted
the station of captain of his guards; and the Magian worship was long
preserved by a colony of loyal exiles in the province of Bucharia.
[3812] His grandson inherited the regal name; but after a faint and
fruitless enterprise, he returned to China, and ended his days in the
palace of Sigan. The male line of the Sassanides was extinct; but the
female captives, the daughters of Persia, were given to the conquerors
in servitude, or marriage; and the race of the caliphs and imams was
ennobled by the blood of their royal mothers. [39]

[Footnote 34: The most authentic accounts of the two rivers, the Sihon
(Jaxartes) and the Gihon, (Oxus,) may be found in Sherif al Edrisi
(Geograph. Nubiens. p. 138,) Abulfeda, (Descript. Chorasan. in Hudson,
tom. iii. p. 23,) Abulghazi Khan, who reigned on their banks, (Hist.
Genealogique des Tatars, p. 32, 57, 766,) and the Turkish Geographer,

history is illustrated by Freret (Mem. de l'Academie, tom. xvi. p.
245-255) and De Guignes, (Hist. des Huns, tom. i. p. 54-59,) and for

Yezdegerd, was not only unfortunate but obscure.]

[Footnote 3811: The account of Yezdegerd's death in the Habeib 'usseyr
and Rouzut uzzuffa (Price, p. 162) is much more probable. On the demand
of the few dhirems, he offered to the miller his sword, and royal
girdle, of inesturable value. This awoke the cupidity of the miller, who
murdered him, and threw the body into the stream.--M.]

[Footnote 3812: Firouz died leaving a son called Ni-ni-cha by the
Chinese, probably Narses. Yezdegerd had two sons, Firouz and Bahram St.
Martin, vol. xi. p. 318.--M.]

[Footnote 39: The two daughters of Yezdegerd married Hassan, the son of
Ali, and Mohammed, the son of Abubeker; and the first of these was the
father of a numerous progeny. The daughter of Phirouz became the wife
of the caliph Walid, and their son Yezid derived his genuine or fabulous
descent from the Chosroes of Persia, the Caesars of Rome, and the
Chagans of the Turks or Avars, (D'Herbelot, Bibliot. Orientale, p. 96,
487.)]

After the fall of the Persian kingdom, the River Oxus divided the
territories of the Saracens and of the Turks. This narrow boundary was
soon overleaped by the spirit of the Arabs; the governors of Chorasan
extended their successive inroads; and one of their triumphs was adorned
with the buskin of a Turkish queen, which she dropped in her precipitate
flight beyond the hills of Bochara. [40] But the final conquest of
Transoxiana, [41] as well as of Spain, was reserved for the glorious
reign of the inactive Walid; and the name of Catibah, the camel driver,
declares the origin and merit of his successful lieutenant. While one of
his colleagues displayed the first Mahometan banner on the banks of
the Indus, the spacious regions between the Oxus, the Jaxartes, and the
Caspian Sea, were reduced by the arms of Catibah to the obedience of the
prophet and of the caliph. [42] A tribute of two millions of pieces of
gold was imposed on the infidels; their idols were burnt or broken; the
Mussulman chief pronounced a sermon in the new mosch of Carizme; after
several battles, the Turkish hordes were driven back to the desert; and
the emperors of China solicited the friendship of the victorious Arabs.
To their industry, the prosperity of the province, the Sogdiana of the
ancients, may in a great measure be ascribed; but the advantages of the
soil and climate had been understood and cultivated since the reign
of the Macedonian kings. Before the invasion of the Saracens, Carizme,
Bochara, and Samarcand were rich and populous under the yoke of the
shepherds of the north. [4211] These cities were surrounded with a
double wall; and the exterior fortification, of a larger circumference,
enclosed the fields and gardens of the adjacent district. The mutual
wants of India and Europe were supplied by the diligence of the Sogdian
merchants; and the inestimable art of transforming linen into paper has
been diffused from the manufacture of Samarcand over the western world.
[43]

[Footnote 40: It was valued at 2000 pieces of gold, and was the prize of
Obeidollah, the son of Ziyad, a name afterwards infamous by the murder
of Hosein, (Ockley's History of the Saracens, vol. ii. p. 142, 143,) His
brother Salem was accompanied by his wife, the first Arabian woman (A.D.
680) who passed the Oxus: she borrowed, or rather stole, the crown and
jewels of the princess of the Sogdians, (p. 231, 232.)]

[Footnote 41: A part of Abulfeda's geography is translated by Greaves,
inserted in Hudson's collection of the minor geographers, (tom. iii.,)
and entitled Descriptio Chorasmiae et Mawaralnahroe, id est, regionum
extra fluvium, Oxum, p. 80. The name of Transoxiana, softer in sound,
equivalent in sense, is aptly used by Petit de la Croix, (Hist. de
Gengiscan, &c.,) and some modern Orientalists, but they are mistaken in
ascribing it to the writers of antiquity.]

[Footnote 42: The conquests of Catibah are faintly marked by Elmacin,
(Hist. Saracen. p. 84,) D'Herbelot, (Bibliot. Orient. Catbah, Samarcand
Valid.,) and De Guignes, (Hist. des Huns, tom. i. p. 58, 59.)]

[Footnote 4211: The manuscripts Arabian and Persian writers in the royal
library contain very circumstantial details on the contest between the
Persians and Arabians. M. St. Martin declined this addition to the work
of Le Beau, as extending to too great a length. St. Martin vol. xi. p.
320.--M.]

[Footnote 43: A curious description of Samarcand is inserted in the
Bibliotheca Arabico-Hispana, tom. i. p. 208, &c. The librarian Casiri
(tom. ii. 9) relates, from credible testimony, that paper was first
imported from China to Samarcand, A. H. 30, and invented, or rather
introduced, at Mecca, A. H. 88. The Escurial library contains paper Mss.
as old as the ivth or vth century of the Hegira.]

II. No sooner had Abubeker restored the unity of faith and government,
than he despatched a circular letter to the Arabian tribes. "In the name
of the most merciful God, to the rest of the true believers. Health and
happiness, and the mercy and blessing of God, be upon you. I praise the
most high God, and I pray for his prophet Mahomet. This is to acquaint
you, that I intend to send the true believers into Syria [44] to take
it out of the hands of the infidels. And I would have you know, that
the fighting for religion is an act of obedience to God." His messengers
returned with the tidings of pious and martial ardor which they had
kindled in every province; and the camp of Medina was successively
filled with the intrepid bands of the Saracens, who panted for action,
complained of the heat of the season and the scarcity of provisions,
and accused with impatient murmurs the delays of the caliph. As soon as
their numbers were complete, Abubeker ascended the hill, reviewed the
men, the horses, and the arms, and poured forth a fervent prayer for the
success of their undertaking. In person, and on foot, he accompanied the
first day's march; and when the blushing leaders attempted to dismount,
the caliph removed their scruples by a declaration, that those who
rode, and those who walked, in the service of religion, were equally
meritorious. His instructions [45] to the chiefs of the Syrian army were
inspired by the warlike fanaticism which advances to seize, and affects
to despise, the objects of earthly ambition. "Remember," said the
successor of the prophet, "that you are always in the presence of God,
on the verge of death, in the assurance of judgment, and the hope of
paradise. Avoid injustice and oppression; consult with your brethren,
and study to preserve the love and confidence of your troops. When
you fight the battles of the Lord, acquit yourselves like men, without
turning your backs; but let not your victory be stained with the blood
of women or children. Destroy no palm-trees, nor burn any fields of
corn. Cut down no fruit-trees, nor do any mischief to cattle, only such
as you kill to eat. When you make any covenant or article, stand to it,
and be as good as your word. As you go on, you will find some religious
persons who live retired in monasteries, and propose to themselves to
serve God that way: let them alone, and neither kill them nor destroy
their monasteries: [46] And you will find another sort of people, that
belong to the synagogue of Satan, who have shaven crowns; [47] be sure
you cleave their skulls, and give them no quarter till they either turn
Mahometans or pay tribute." All profane or frivolous conversation,
all dangerous recollection of ancient quarrels, was severely prohibited
among the Arabs: in the tumult of a camp, the exercises of religion
were assiduously practised; and the intervals of action were employed in
prayer, meditation, and the study of the Koran. The abuse, or even the
use, of wine was chastised by fourscore strokes on the soles of the
feet, and in the fervor of their primitive zeal, many secret sinners
revealed their fault, and solicited their punishment. After some
hesitation, the command of the Syrian army was delegated to Abu Obeidah,
one of the fugitives of Mecca, and companions of Mahomet; whose zeal and
devotion was assuaged, without being abated, by the singular mildness
and benevolence of his temper. But in all the emergencies of war, the
soldiers demanded the superior genius of Caled; and whoever might be
the choice of the prince, the Sword of God was both in fact and fame the
foremost leader of the Saracens. He obeyed without reluctance; [4711] he
was consulted without jealousy; and such was the spirit of the man, or
rather of the times, that Caled professed his readiness to serve under
the banner of the faith, though it were in the hands of a child or an
enemy. Glory, and riches, and dominion, were indeed promised to the
victorious Mussulman; but he was carefully instructed, that if the goods
of this life were his only incitement, they likewise would be his only
reward.

[Footnote 44: A separate history of the conquest of Syria has been
composed by Al Wakidi, cadi of Bagdad, who was born A.D. 748, and died
A.D. 822; he likewise wrote the conquest of Egypt, of Diarbekir, &c.
Above the meagre and recent chronicles of the Arabians, Al Wakidi has
the double merit of antiquity and copiousness. His tales and traditions
afford an artless picture of the men and the times. Yet his narrative
is too often defective, trifling, and improbable. Till something better
shall be found, his learned and spiritual interpreter (Ockley, in
his History of the Saracens, vol. i. p. 21-342) will not deserve
the petulant animadversion of Reiske, (Prodidagmata ad Magji Chalifae
Tabulas, p. 236.) I am sorry to think that the labors of Ockley were
consummated in a jail, (see his two prefaces to the 1st A.D. 1708, to
the 2d, 1718, with the list of authors at the end.) * Note: M. Hamaker
has clearly shown that neither of these works can be inscribed to Al
Wakidi: they are not older than the end of the xith century or
later than the middle of the xivth. Praefat. in Inc. Auct. LIb. de
Expugnatione Memphidis, c. ix. x.--M.]

[Footnote 45: The instructions, &c., of the Syrian war are described
by Al Wakidi and Ockley, tom. i. p. 22-27, &c. In the sequel it is
necessary to contract, and needless to quote, their circumstantial
narrative. My obligations to others shall be noticed.]

[Footnote 46: Notwithstanding this precept, M. Pauw (Recherches sur les
Egyptiens, tom. ii. p. 192, edit. Lausanne) represents the Bedoweens
as the implacable enemies of the Christian monks. For my own part, I
am more inclined to suspect the avarice of the Arabian robbers, and the
prejudices of the German philosopher. * Note: Several modern travellers
(Mr. Fazakerley, in Walpole's Travels in the East, vol. xi. 371) give
very amusing accounts of the terms on which the monks of Mount Sinai
live with the neighboring Bedoweens. Such, probably, was their
relative state in older times, wherever the Arab retained his Bedoween
habits.--M.]

[Footnote 47: Even in the seventh century, the monks were generally
laymen: 'hey wore their hair long and dishevelled, and shaved their
heads when they were ordained priests. The circular tonsure was sacred
and mysterious; it was the crown of thorns; but it was likewise a royal
diadem, and every priest was a king, &c., (Thomassin, Discipline de
l'Eglise, tom. i. p. 721-758, especially p. 737, 738.)]
