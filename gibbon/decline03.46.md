## Chapter XXXVIII: Reign Of Clovis.--Part IV.

Before the Austrasian army retreated from Auvergne, Theodoric exacted
some pledges of the future loyalty of a people, whose just hatred could
be restrained only by their fear. A select band of noble youths, the
sons of the principal senators, was delivered to the conqueror, as the
hostages of the faith of Childebert, and of their countrymen. On the
first rumor of war, or conspiracy, these guiltless youths were
reduced to a state of servitude; and one of them, Attalus, [107] whose
adventures are more particularly related, kept his master's horses in
the diocese of Treves. After a painful search, he was discovered, in
this unworthy occupation, by the emissaries of his grandfather, Gregory
bishop of Langres; but his offers of ransom were sternly rejected by the
avarice of the Barbarian, who required an exorbitant sum of ten pounds
of gold for the freedom of his noble captive. His deliverance was
effected by the hardy stratagem of Leo, an item belonging to the
kitchens of the bishop of Langres. [108] An unknown agent easily
introduced him into the same family. The Barbarian purchased Leo for
the price of twelve pieces of gold; and was pleased to learn that he was
deeply skilled in the luxury of an episcopal table: "Next Sunday," said
the Frank, "I shall invite my neighbors and kinsmen. Exert thy art, and
force them to confess, that they have never seen, or tasted, such an
entertainment, even in the king's house." Leo assured him, that if he
would provide a sufficient quantity of poultry, his wishes should
be satisfied. The master who already aspired to the merit of elegant
hospitality, assumed, as his own, the praise which the voracious guests
unanimously bestowed on his cook; and the dexterous Leo insensibly
acquired the trust and management of his household. After the patient
expectation of a whole year, he cautiously whispered his design to
Attalus, and exhorted him to prepare for flight in the ensuing night. At
the hour of midnight, the intemperate guests retired from the table;
and the Frank's son-in-law, whom Leo attended to his apartment with a
nocturnal potation, condescended to jest on the facility with which
he might betray his trust. The intrepid slave, after sustaining this
dangerous raillery, entered his master's bedchamber; removed his spear
and shield; silently drew the fleetest horses from the stable; unbarred
the ponderous gates; and excited Attalus to save his life and liberty
by incessant diligence. Their apprehensions urged them to leave their
horses on the banks of the Meuse; [109] they swam the river, wandered
three days in the adjacent forest, and subsisted only by the accidental
discovery of a wild plum-tree. As they lay concealed in a dark thicket,
they heard the noise of horses; they were terrified by the angry
countenance of their master, and they anxiously listened to his
declaration, that, if he could seize the guilty fugitives, one of them
he would cut in pieces with his sword, and would expose the other on
a gibbet. A length, Attalus and his faithful Leo reached the friendly
habitation of a presbyter of Rheims, who recruited their fainting
strength with bread and wine, concealed them from the search of their
enemy, and safely conducted them beyond the limits of the Austrasian
kingdom, to the episcopal palace of Langres. Gregory embraced his
grandson with tears of joy, gratefully delivered Leo, with his whole
family, from the yoke of servitude, and bestowed on him the property of
a farm, where he might end his days in happiness and freedom. Perhaps
this singular adventure, which is marked with so many circumstances
of truth and nature, was related by Attalus himself, to his cousin or
nephew, the first historian of the Franks. Gregory of Tours [110] was
born about sixty years after the death of Sidonius Apollinaris; and
their situation was almost similar, since each of them was a native of
Auvergne, a senator, and a bishop. The difference of their style and
sentiments may, therefore, express the decay of Gaul; and clearly
ascertain how much, in so short a space, the human mind had lost of its
energy and refinement. [111]

[Footnote 107: The story of Attalus is related by Gregory of Tours, (l.
iii. c. 16, tom. ii. p. 193-195.) His editor, the P. Ruinart, confounds
this Attalus, who was a youth (puer) in the year 532, with a friend of
Silonius of the same name, who was count of Autun, fifty or sixty years
before. Such an error, which cannot be imputed to ignorance, is excused,
in some degree, by its own magnitude.]

[Footnote 108: This Gregory, the great grandfather of Gregory of Tours,
(in tom. ii. p. 197, 490,) lived ninety-two years; of which he passed
forty as count of Autun, and thirty-two as bishop of Langres. According
to the poet Fortunatus, he displayed equal merit in these different
stations. Nobilis antiqua decurrens prole parentum, Nobilior gestis,
nunc super astra manet. Arbiter ante ferox, dein pius ipse sacerdos,
Quos domuit judex, fovit amore patris.]

[Footnote 109: As M. de Valois, and the P. Ruinart, are determined to
change the Mosella of the text into Mosa, it becomes me to acquiesce in
the alteration. Yet, after some examination of the topography. I could
defend the common reading.]

[Footnote 110: The parents of Gregory (Gregorius Florentius Georgius)
were of noble extraction, (natalibus... illustres,) and they possessed
large estates (latifundia) both in Auvergne and Burgundy. He was born in
the year 539, was consecrated bishop of Tours in 573, and died in 593
or 595, soon after he had terminated his history. See his life by
Odo, abbot of Clugny, (in tom. ii. p. 129-135,) and a new Life in the
Memoires de l'Academie, &c., tom. xxvi. p. 598-637.]

[Footnote 111: Decedente atque immo potius pereunte ab urbibus
Gallicanis liberalium cultura literarum, &c., (in praefat. in tom. ii.
p. 137,) is the complaint of Gregory himself, which he fully verifies by
his own work. His style is equally devoid of elegance and simplicity. In
a conspicuous station, he still remained a stranger to his own age and
country; and in a prolific work (the five last books contain ten years)
he has omitted almost every thing that posterity desires to learn. I
have tediously acquired, by a painful perusal, the right of pronouncing
this unfavorable sentence] We are now qualified to despise the opposite,
and, perhaps, artful, misrepresentations, which have softened, or
exaggerated, the oppression of the Romans of Gaul under the reign of the
Merovingians. The conquerors never promulgated any universal edict of
servitude, or confiscation; but a degenerate people, who excused their
weakness by the specious names of politeness and peace, was exposed
to the arms and laws of the ferocious Barbarians, who contemptuously
insulted their possessions, their freedom, and their safety. Their
personal injuries were partial and irregular; but the great body of the
Romans survived the revolution, and still preserved the property, and
privileges, of citizens. A large portion of their lands was exacted
for the use of the Franks: but they enjoyed the remainder, exempt from
tribute; [112] and the same irresistible violence which swept away the
arts and manufactures of Gaul, destroyed the elaborate and expensive
system of Imperial despotism. The Provincials must frequently deplore
the savage jurisprudence of the Salic or Ripuarian laws; but their
private life, in the important concerns of marriage, testaments,
or inheritance, was still regulated by the Theodosian Code; and a
discontented Roman might freely aspire, or descend, to the title and
character of a Barbarian. The honors of the state were accessible to
his ambition: the education and temper of the Romans more peculiarly
qualified them for the offices of civil government; and, as soon as
emulation had rekindled their military ardor, they were permitted to
march in the ranks, or even at the head, of the victorious Germans. I
shall not attempt to enumerate the generals and magistrates, whose names
[113] attest the liberal policy of the Merovingians. The supreme command
of Burgundy, with the title of Patrician, was successively intrusted
to three Romans; and the last, and most powerful, Mummolus, [114] who
alternately saved and disturbed the monarchy, had supplanted his father
in the station of count of Autun, and left a treasury of thirty talents
of gold, and two hundred and fifty talents of silver. The fierce and
illiterate Barbarians were excluded, during several generations, from
the dignities, and even from the orders, of the church. [115] The clergy
of Gaul consisted almost entirely of native provincials; the haughty
Franks fell at the feet of their subjects, who were dignified with the
episcopal character: and the power and riches which had been lost in
war, were insensibly recovered by superstition. [116] In all temporal
affairs, the Theodosian Code was the universal law of the clergy; but
the Barbaric jurisprudence had liberally provided for their personal
safety; a sub-deacon was equivalent to two Franks; the antrustion, and
priest, were held in similar estimation: and the life of a bishop was
appreciated far above the common standard, at the price of nine hundred
pieces of gold. [117] The Romans communicated to their conquerors
the use of the Christian religion and Latin language; [118] but their
language and their religion had alike degenerated from the simple purity
of the Augustan, and Apostolic age. The progress of superstition and
Barbarism was rapid and universal: the worship of the saints concealed
from vulgar eyes the God of the Christians; and the rustic dialect
of peasants and soldiers was corrupted by a Teutonic idiom and
pronunciation. Yet such intercourse of sacred and social communion
eradicated the distinctions of birth and victory; and the nations of
Gaul were gradually confounded under the name and government of the
Franks.

[Footnote 112: The Abbe de Mably (tom. p. i. 247-267) has diligently
confirmed this opinion of the President de Montesquieu, (Esprit des
Loix, l. xxx. c. 13.)]

[Footnote 113: See Dubos, Hist. Critique de la Monarchie Francoise, tom.
ii. l. vi. c. 9, 10. The French antiquarians establish as a principle,
that the Romans and Barbarians may be distinguished by their names.
Their names undoubtedly form a reasonable presumption; yet in reading
Gregory of Tours, I have observed Gondulphus, of Senatorian, or
Roman, extraction, (l. vi. c. 11, in tom. ii. p. 273,) and Claudius, a
Barbarian, (l. vii. c. 29, p. 303.)]

[Footnote 114: Eunius Mummolus is repeatedly mentioned by Gregory of
Tours, from the fourth (c. 42, p. 224) to the seventh (c. 40, p. 310)
book. The computation by talents is singular enough; but if Gregory
attached any meaning to that obsolete word, the treasures of Mummolus
must have exceeded 100,000 L. sterling.]

[Footnote 115: See Fleury, Discours iii. sur l'Histoire Ecclesiastique.]

[Footnote 116: The bishop of Tours himself has recorded the complaint of
Chilperic, the grandson of Clovis. Ecce pauper remansit Fiscus noster;
ecce divitiae nostrae ad ecclesias sunt translatae; nulli penitus nisi
soli Episcopi regnant, (l. vi. c. 46, in tom. ii. p. 291.)]

[Footnote 117: See the Ripuarian Code, (tit. xxxvi in tom. iv. p. 241.)
The Salic law does not provide for the safety of the clergy; and we
might suppose, on the behalf of the more civilized tribe, that they
had not foreseen such an impious act as the murder of a priest. Yet
Praetextatus, archbishop of Rouen, was assassinated by the order of
Queen Fredegundis before the altar, (Greg. Turon. l. viii. c. 31, in
tom. ii. p. 326.)]

[Footnote 118: M. Bonamy (Mem. de l'Academie des Inscriptions, tom.
xxiv. p. 582-670) has ascertained the Lingua Romana Rustica, which,
through the medium of the Romance, has gradually been polished into the
actual form of the French language. Under the Carlovingian race, the
kings and nobles of France still understood the dialect of their German
ancestors.]

The Franks, after they mingled with their Gallic subjects, might have
imparted the most valuable of human gifts, a spirit and system of
constitutional liberty. Under a king, hereditary, but limited, the
chiefs and counsellors might have debated at Paris, in the palace of the
Caesars: the adjacent field, where the emperors reviewed their mercenary
legions. would have admitted the legislative assembly of freemen and
warriors; and the rude model, which had been sketched in the woods of
Germany, [119] might have been polished and improved by the civil wisdom
of the Romans. But the careless Barbarians, secure of their personal
independence, disdained the labor of government: the annual assemblies
of the month of March were silently abolished; and the nation was
separated, and almost dissolved, by the conquest of Gaul. [120] The
monarchy was left without any regular establishment of justice, of arms,
or of revenue. The successors of Clovis wanted resolution to assume, or
strength to exercise, the legislative and executive powers, which the
people had abdicated: the royal prerogative was distinguished only by a
more ample privilege of rapine and murder; and the love of freedom, so
often invigorated and disgraced by private ambition, was reduced, among
the licentious Franks, to the contempt of order, and the desire of
impunity. Seventy-five years after the death of Clovis, his grandson,
Gontran, king of Burgundy, sent an army to invade the Gothic possessions
of Septimania, or Languedoc. The troops of Burgundy, Berry, Auvergne,
and the adjacent territories, were excited by the hopes of spoil. They
marched, without discipline, under the banners of German, or Gallic,
counts: their attack was feeble and unsuccessful; but the friendly
and hostile provinces were desolated with indiscriminate rage. The
cornfields, the villages, the churches themselves, were consumed by
fire: the inhabitants were massacred, or dragged into captivity; and,
in the disorderly retreat, five thousand of these inhuman savages
were destroyed by hunger or intestine discord. When the pious Gontran
reproached the guilt or neglect of their leaders, and threatened to
inflict, not a legal sentence, but instant and arbitrary execution, they
accused the universal and incurable corruption of the people. "No one,"
they said, "any longer fears or respects his king, his duke, or his
count. Each man loves to do evil, and freely indulges his criminal
inclinations. The most gentle correction provokes an immediate tumult,
and the rash magistrate, who presumes to censure or restrain his
seditious subjects, seldom escapes alive from their revenge." [121] It
has been reserved for the same nation to expose, by their intemperate
vices, the most odious abuse of freedom; and to supply its loss by the
spirit of honor and humanity, which now alleviates and dignifies their
obedience to an absolute sovereign. [1211]

[Footnote 120: See the Abbe de Mably. Observations, &c., tom. i. p.
34-56. It should seem that the institution of national assemblies, which
are with the French nation, has never been congenial to its temper.]

[Footnote 121: Gregory of Tours (l. viii. c. 30, in tom. ii. p. 325,
326) relates, with much indifference, the crimes, the reproof, and the
apology. Nullus Regem metuit, nullus Ducem, nullus Comitem reveretur;
et si fortassis alicui ista displicent, et ea, pro longaevitate vitae
vestrae, emendare conatur, statim seditio in populo, statim tumultus
exoritur, et in tantum unusquisque contra seniorem saeva intentione
grassatur, ut vix se credat evadere, si tandem silere nequiverit.]

[Footnote 1211: This remarkable passage was published in 1779--M.]

The Visigoths had resigned to Clovis the greatest part of their Gallic
possessions; but their loss was amply compensated by the easy conquest,
and secure enjoyment, of the provinces of Spain. From the monarchy
of the Goths, which soon involved the Suevic kingdom of Gallicia, the
modern Spaniards still derive some national vanity; but the historian
of the Roman empire is neither invited, nor compelled, to pursue the
obscure and barren series of their annals. [122] The Goths of Spain were
separated from the rest of mankind by the lofty ridge of the Pyrenaean
mountains: their manners and institutions, as far as they were common to
the Germanic tribes, have been already explained. I have anticipated,
in the preceding chapter, the most important of their ecclesiastical
events, the fall of Arianism, and the persecution of the Jews; and it
only remains to observe some interesting circumstances which relate to
the civil and ecclesiastical constitution of the Spanish kingdom.

[Footnote 122: Spain, in these dark ages, has been peculiarly
unfortunate. The Franks had a Gregory of Tours; the Saxons, or Angles,
a Bede; the Lombards, a Paul Warnefrid, &c. But the history of the
Visigoths is contained in the short and imperfect Chronicles of Isidore
of Seville and John of Biclar] After their conversion from idolatry or
heresy, the Frank and the Visigoths were disposed to embrace, with
equal submission, the inherent evils and the accidental benefits, of
superstition. But the prelates of France, long before the extinction
of the Merovingian race, had degenerated into fighting and hunting
Barbarians. They disdained the use of synods; forgot the laws of
temperance and chastity; and preferred the indulgence of private
ambition and luxury to the general interest of the sacerdotal
profession. [123] The bishops of Spain respected themselves, and were
respected by the public: their indissoluble union disguised their vices,
and confirmed their authority; and the regular discipline of the church
introduced peace, order, and stability, into the government of the
state. From the reign of Recared, the first Catholic king, to that of
Witiza, the immediate predecessor of the unfortunate Roderic, sixteen
national councils were successively convened. The six metropolitans,
Toledo, Seville, Merida, Braga, Tarragona, and Narbonne, presided
according to their respective seniority; the assembly was composed of
their suffragan bishops, who appeared in person, or by their proxies;
and a place was assigned to the most holy, or opulent, of the Spanish
abbots. During the first three days of the convocation, as long as they
agitated the ecclesiastical question of doctrine and discipline, the
profane laity was excluded from their debates; which were conducted,
however, with decent solemnity. But, on the morning of the fourth day,
the doors were thrown open for the entrance of the great officers of the
palace, the dukes and counts of the provinces, the judges of the cities,
and the Gothic nobles, and the decrees of Heaven were ratified by the
consent of the people.

The same rules were observed in the provincial assemblies, the annual
synods, which were empowered to hear complaints, and to redress
grievances; and a legal government was supported by the prevailing
influence of the Spanish clergy. The bishops, who, in each revolution,
were prepared to flatter the victorious, and to insult the prostrate
labored, with diligence and success, to kindle the flames of
persecution, and to exalt the mitre above the crown. Yet the national
councils of Toledo, in which the free spirit of the Barbarians was
tempered and guided by episcopal policy, have established some prudent
laws for the common benefit of the king and people. The vacancy of the
throne was supplied by the choice of the bishops and palatines; and
after the failure of the line of Alaric, the regal dignity was still
limited to the pure and noble blood of the Goths. The clergy, who
anointed their lawful prince, always recommended, and sometimes
practised, the duty of allegiance; and the spiritual censures were
denounced on the heads of the impious subjects, who should resist his
authority, conspire against his life, or violate, by an indecent
union, the chastity even of his widow. But the monarch himself, when
he ascended the throne, was bound by a reciprocal oath to God and his
people, that he would faithfully execute this important trust. The real
or imaginary faults of his administration were subject to the control of
a powerful aristocracy; and the bishops and palatines were guarded by
a fundamental privilege, that they should not be degraded, imprisoned,
tortured, nor punished with death, exile, or confiscation, unless by the
free and public judgment of their peers. [124]

[Footnote 123: Such are the complaints of St. Boniface, the apostle of
Germany, and the reformer of Gaul, (in tom. iv. p. 94.) The fourscore
years, which he deplores, of license and corruption, would seem to
insinuate that the Barbarians were admitted into the clergy about the
year 660.]

[Footnote 124: The acts of the councils of Toledo are still the most
authentic records of the church and constitution of Spain. The following
passages are particularly important, (iii. 17, 18; iv. 75; v. 2, 3, 4,
5, 8; vi. 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18; vii. 1; xiii. 2 3 6.) I have found
Mascou (Hist. of the Ancient Germans, xv. 29, and Annotations, xxvi.
and xxxiii.) and Ferreras (Hist. Generale de l'Espagne, tom. ii.) very
useful and accurate guides.]

One of these legislative councils of Toledo examined and ratified the
code of laws which had been compiled by a succession of Gothic kings,
from the fierce Euric, to the devout Egica. As long as the Visigoths
themselves were satisfied with the rude customs of their ancestors, they
indulged their subjects of Aquitain and Spain in the enjoyment of the
Roman law. Their gradual improvement in arts, in policy, and at length
in religion, encouraged them to imitate, and to supersede, these foreign
institutions; and to compose a code of civil and criminal jurisprudence,
for the use of a great and united people. The same obligations, and
the same privileges, were communicated to the nations of the Spanish
monarchy; and the conquerors, insensibly renouncing the Teutonic idiom,
submitted to the restraints of equity, and exalted the Romans to
the participation of freedom. The merit of this impartial policy was
enhanced by the situation of Spain under the reign of the Visigoths.
The provincials were long separated from their Arian masters by the
irreconcilable difference of religion. After the conversion of Recared
had removed the prejudices of the Catholics, the coasts, both of the
Ocean and Mediterranean, were still possessed by the Eastern emperors;
who secretly excited a discontented people to reject the yoke of the
Barbarians, and to assert the name and dignity of Roman citizens. The
allegiance of doubtful subjects is indeed most effectually secured by
their own persuasion, that they hazard more in a revolt, than they
can hope to obtain by a revolution; but it has appeared so natural
to oppress those whom we hate and fear, that the contrary system well
deserves the praise of wisdom and moderation. [125]

[Footnote 125: The Code of the Visigoths, regularly divided into twelve
books, has been correctly published by Dom Bouquet, (in tom. iv. p.
273-460.) It has been treated by the President de Montesquieu (Esprit
des Loix, l. xxviii. c. 1) with excessive severity. I dislike the style;
I detest the superstition; but I shall presume to think, that the
civil jurisprudence displays a more civilized and enlightened state of
society, than that of the Burgundians, or even of the Lombards.]

While the kingdom of the Franks and Visigoths were established in Gaul
and Spain, the Saxons achieved the conquest of Britain, the third
great diocese of the Praefecture of the West. Since Britain was already
separated from the Roman empire, I might, without reproach, decline a
story familiar to the most illiterate, and obscure to the most learned,
of my readers. The Saxons, who excelled in the use of the oar, or the
battle-axe, were ignorant of the art which could alone perpetuate the
fame of their exploits; the Provincials, relapsing into barbarism,
neglected to describe the ruin of their country; and the doubtful
tradition was almost extinguished, before the missionaries of Rome
restored the light of science and Christianity. The declamations of
Gildas, the fragments, or fables, of Nennius, the obscure hints of the
Saxon laws and chronicles, and the ecclesiastical tales of the venerable
Bede, [126] have been illustrated by the diligence, and sometimes
embellished by the fancy, of succeeding writers, whose works I am not
ambitious either to censure or to transcribe. [127] Yet the historian of
the empire may be tempted to pursue the revolutions of a Roman province,
till it vanishes from his sight; and an Englishman may curiously trace
the establishment of the Barbarians, from whom he derives his name, his
laws, and perhaps his origin.

About forty years after the dissolution of the Roman government,
Vortigern appears to have obtained the supreme, though precarious
command of the princes and cities of Britain. That unfortunate monarch
has been almost unanimously condemned for the weak and mischievous
policy of inviting [128] a formidable stranger, to repel the vexatious
inroads of a domestic foe. His ambassadors are despatched, by the
gravest historians, to the coast of Germany: they address a pathetic
oration to the general assembly of the Saxons, and those warlike
Barbarians resolve to assist with a fleet and army the suppliants of a
distant and unknown island. If Britain had indeed been unknown to the
Saxons, the measure of its calamities would have been less complete. But
the strength of the Roman government could not always guard the maritime
province against the pirates of Germany; the independent and divided
states were exposed to their attacks; and the Saxons might sometimes
join the Scots and the Picts, in a tacit, or express, confederacy of
rapine and destruction. Vortigern could only balance the various perils,
which assaulted on every side his throne and his people; and his policy
may deserve either praise or excuse, if he preferred the alliance of
those Barbarians, whose naval power rendered them the most dangerous
enemies and the most serviceable allies. Hengist and Horsa, as they
ranged along the Eastern coast with three ships, were engaged, by the
promise of an ample stipend, to embrace the defence of Britain; and
their intrepid valor soon delivered the country from the Caledonian
invaders. The Isle of Thanet, a secure and fertile district, was
allotted for the residence of these German auxiliaries, and they
were supplied, according to the treaty, with a plentiful allowance
of clothing and provisions. This favorable reception encouraged five
thousand warriors to embark with their families in seventeen vessels,
and the infant power of Hengist was fortified by this strong and
seasonable reenforcement. The crafty Barbarian suggested to Vortigern
the obvious advantage of fixing, in the neighborhood of the Picts,
a colony of faithful allies: a third fleet of forty ships, under the
command of his son and nephew, sailed from Germany, ravaged the Orkneys,
and disembarked a new army on the coast of Northumberland, or Lothian,
at the opposite extremity of the devoted land. It was easy to foresee,
but it was impossible to prevent, the impending evils. The two nations
were soon divided and exasperated by mutual jealousies. The Saxons
magnified all that they had done and suffered in the cause of an
ungrateful people; while the Britons regretted the liberal rewards which
could not satisfy the avarice of those haughty mercenaries. The causes
of fear and hatred were inflamed into an irreconcilable quarrel. The
Saxons flew to arms; and if they perpetrated a treacherous massacre
during the security of a feast, they destroyed the reciprocal confidence
which sustains the intercourse of peace and war. [129]

[Footnote 128: This invitation, which may derive some countenance from
the loose expressions of Gildas and Bede, is framed into a regular story
by Witikind, a Saxon monk of the tenth century, (see Cousin, Hist. de
l'Empire d'Occident, tom. ii. p. 356.) Rapin, and even Hume, have too
freely used this suspicious evidence, without regarding the precise and
probable testimony of Tennius: Iterea venerunt tres Chinlae a exilio
pulsoe, in quibus erant Hors et Hengist.]

[Footnote 129: Nennius imputes to the Saxons the murder of three hundred
British chiefs; a crime not unsuitable to their savage manners. But we
are not obliged to believe (see Jeffrey of Monmouth, l. viii. c.
9-12) that Stonehenge is their monument, which the giants had formerly
transported from Africa to Ireland, and which was removed to Britain by
the order of Ambrosius, and the art of Merlin. * Note: Sir f. Palgrave
(Hist. of England, p. 36) is inclined to resolve the whole of these
stories, as Niebuhr the older Roman history, into poetry. To the editor
they appeared, in early youth, so essentially poetic, as to justify the
rash attempt to embody them in an Epic Poem, called Samor, commenced
at Eton, and finished before he had arrived at the maturer taste of
manhood.--M.]

Hengist, who boldly aspired to the conquest of Britain, exhorted his
countrymen to embrace the glorious opportunity: he painted in lively
colors the fertility of the soil, the wealth of the cities, the
pusillanimous temper of the natives, and the convenient situation of a
spacious solitary island, accessible on all sides to the Saxon fleets.
The successive colonies which issued, in the period of a century, from
the mouths of the Elbe, the Weser, and the Rhine, were principally
composed of three valiant tribes or nations of Germany; the Jutes, the
old Saxons, and the Angles. The Jutes, who fought under the peculiar
banner of Hengist, assumed the merit of leading their countrymen in the
paths of glory, and of erecting, in Kent, the first independent kingdom.
The fame of the enterprise was attributed to the primitive Saxons; and
the common laws and language of the conquerors are described by the
national appellation of a people, which, at the end of four hundred
years, produced the first monarchs of South Britain. The Angles were
distinguished by their numbers and their success; and they claimed the
honor of fixing a perpetual name on the country, of which they occupied
the most ample portion. The Barbarians, who followed the hopes of rapine
either on the land or sea, were insensibly blended with this triple
confederacy; the Frisians, who had been tempted by their vicinity to the
British shores, might balance, during a short space, the strength and
reputation of the native Saxons; the Danes, the Prussians, the Rugians,
are faintly described; and some adventurous Huns, who had wandered as
far as the Baltic, might embark on board the German vessels, for the
conquest of a new world. [130] But this arduous achievement was not
prepared or executed by the union of national powers. Each intrepid
chieftain, according to the measure of his fame and fortunes, assembled
his followers; equipped a fleet of three, or perhaps of sixty, vessels;
chose the place of the attack; and conducted his subsequent operations
according to the events of the war, and the dictates of his private
interest. In the invasion of Britain many heroes vanquished and fell;
but only seven victorious leaders assumed, or at least maintained, the
title of kings. Seven independent thrones, the Saxon Heptarchy, [1301]
were founded by the conquerors, and seven families, one of which has
been continued, by female succession, to our present sovereign, derived
their equal and sacred lineage from Woden, the god of war. It has
been pretended, that this republic of kings was moderated by a general
council and a supreme magistrate. But such an artificial scheme of
policy is repugnant to the rude and turbulent spirit of the Saxons:
their laws are silent; and their imperfect annals afford only a dark and
bloody prospect of intestine discord. [131]

[Footnote 130: All these tribes are expressly enumerated by Bede, (l.
i. c. 15, p. 52, l. v. c. 9, p. 190;) and though I have considered Mr.
Whitaker's remarks, (Hist. of Manchester, vol. ii. p. 538-543,) I do not
perceive the absurdity of supposing that the Frisians, &c., were mingled
with the Anglo-Saxons.]

[Footnote 1301: This term (the Heptarchy) must be rejected because an
idea is conveyed thereby which is substantially wrong. At no one period
were there ever seven kingdoms independent of each other. Palgrave, vol.
i. p. 46. Mr. Sharon Turner has the merit of having first confuted
the popular notion on this subject. Anglo-Saxon History, vol. i. p.
302.--M.]

[Footnote 131: Bede has enumerated seven kings, two Saxons, a Jute, and
four Angles, who successively acquired in the heptarchy an indefinite
supremacy of power and renown. But their reign was the effect, not of
law, but of conquest; and he observes, in similar terms, that one of
them subdued the Isles of Man and Anglesey; and that another imposed a
tribute on the Scots and Picts. (Hist. Eccles. l. ii. c. 5, p. 83.)]

A monk, who, in the profound ignorance of human life, has presumed to
exercise the office of historian, strangely disfigures the state of
Britain at the time of its separation from the Western empire. Gildas
[132] describes in florid language the improvements of agriculture,
the foreign trade which flowed with every tide into the Thames and the
Severn the solid and lofty construction of public and private edifices;
he accuses the sinful luxury of the British people; of a people,
according to the same writer, ignorant of the most simple arts, and
incapable, without the aid of the Romans, of providing walls of stone,
or weapons of iron, for the defence of their native land. [133] Under
the long dominion of the emperors, Britain had been insensibly moulded
into the elegant and servile form of a Roman province, whose safety
was intrusted to a foreign power. The subjects of Honorius contemplated
their new freedom with surprise and terror; they were left destitute of
any civil or military constitution; and their uncertain rulers wanted
either skill, or courage, or authority, to direct the public force
against the common enemy. The introduction of the Saxons betrayed their
internal weakness, and degraded the character both of the prince and
people. Their consternation magnified the danger; the want of union
diminished their resources; and the madness of civil factions was more
solicitous to accuse, than to remedy, the evils, which they imputed to
the misconduct of their adversaries.

Yet the Britons were not ignorant, they could not be ignorant, of the
manufacture or the use of arms; the successive and disorderly attacks
of the Saxons allowed them to recover from their amazement, and the
prosperous or adverse events of the war added discipline and experience
to their native valor.

[Footnote 133: Mr. Whitaker (Hist. of Manchester, vol. ii. p. 503, 516)
has smartly exposed this glaring absurdity, which had passed unnoticed
by the general historians, as they were hastening to more interesting
and important events]

While the continent of Europe and Africa yielded, without resistance,
to the Barbarians, the British island, alone and unaided, maintained
a long, a vigorous, though an unsuccessful, struggle, against the
formidable pirates, who, almost at the same instant, assaulted the
Northern, the Eastern, and the Southern coasts. The cities which had
been fortified with skill, were defended with resolution; the advantages
of ground, hills, forests, and morasses, were diligently improved by the
inhabitants; the conquest of each district was purchased with blood; and
the defeats of the Saxons are strongly attested by the discreet silence
of their annalist. Hengist might hope to achieve the conquest of
Britain; but his ambition, in an active reign of thirty-five years, was
confined to the possession of Kent; and the numerous colony which he had
planted in the North, was extirpated by the sword of the Britons. The
monarchy of the West Saxons was laboriously founded by the persevering
efforts of three martial generations. The life of Cerdic, one of the
bravest of the children of Woden, was consumed in the conquest of
Hampshire, and the Isle of Wight; and the loss which he sustained in
the battle of Mount Badon, reduced him to a state of inglorious repose.
Kenric, his valiant son, advanced into Wiltshire; besieged Salisbury, at
that time seated on a commanding eminence; and vanquished an army
which advanced to the relief of the city. In the subsequent battle of
Marlborough, [134] his British enemies displayed their military science.
Their troops were formed in three lines; each line consisted of three
distinct bodies, and the cavalry, the archers, and the pikemen, were
distributed according to the principles of Roman tactics. The Saxons
charged in one weighty column, boldly encountered with their shord
swords the long lances of the Britons, and maintained an equal conflict
till the approach of night. Two decisive victories, the death of three
British kings, and the reduction of Cirencester, Bath, and Gloucester,
established the fame and power of Ceaulin, the grandson of Cerdic, who
carried his victorious arms to the banks of the Severn.

[Footnote 134: At Beran-birig, or Barbury-castle, near Marlborough. The
Saxon chronicle assigns the name and date. Camden (Britannia, vol. i.
p. 128) ascertains the place; and Henry of Huntingdon (Scriptores
pest Bedam, p. 314) relates the circumstances of this battle. They are
probable and characteristic; and the historians of the twelfth century
might consult some materials that no longer exist.] After a war of a
hundred years, the independent Britons still occupied the whole
extent of the Western coast, from the wall of Antoninus to the extreme
promontory of Cornwall; and the principal cities of the inland country
still opposed the arms of the Barbarians. Resistance became more
languid, as the number and boldness of the assailants continually
increased. Winning their way by slow and painful efforts, the Saxons,
the Angles, and their various confederates, advanced from the North,
from the East, and from the South, till their victorious banners were
united in the centre of the island. Beyond the Severn the Britons still
asserted their national freedom, which survived the heptarchy, and even
the monarchy, of the Saxons. The bravest warriors, who preferred
exile to slavery, found a secure refuge in the mountains of Wales: the
reluctant submission of Cornwall was delayed for some ages; [135] and a
band of fugitives acquired a settlement in Gaul, by their own valor,
or the liberality of the Merovingian kings. [136] The Western angle
of Armorica acquired the new appellations of Cornwall, and the Lesser
Britain; and the vacant lands of the Osismii were filled by a strange
people, who, under the authority of their counts and bishops, preserved
the laws and language of their ancestors. To the feeble descendants of
Clovis and Charlemagne, the Britons of Armorica refused the customary
tribute, subdued the neighboring dioceses of Vannes, Rennes, and Nantes,
and formed a powerful, though vassal, state, which has been united to
the crown of France. [137]

[Footnote 135: Cornwall was finally subdued by Athelstan, (A.D.
927-941,) who planted an English colony at Exeter, and confined the
Britons beyond the River Tamar. See William of Malmsbury, l. ii., in
the Scriptores post Bedam, p. 50. The spirit of the Cornish knights
was degraded by servitude: and it should seem, from the Romance of Sir
Tristram, that their cowardice was almost proverbial.]

[Footnote 136: The establishment of the Britons in Gaul is proved in
the sixth century, by Procopius, Gregory of Tours, the second council
of Tours, (A.D. 567,) and the least suspicious of their chronicles and
lives of saints. The subscription of a bishop of the Britons to
the first council of Tours, (A.D. 461, or rather 481,) the army of
Riothamus, and the loose declamation of Gildas, (alii transmarinas
petebant regiones, c. 25, p. 8,) may countenance an emigration as early
as the middle of the fifth century. Beyond that era, the Britons of
Armorica can be found only in romance; and I am surprised that Mr.
Whitaker (Genuine History of the Britons, p. 214-221) should so
faithfully transcribe the gross ignorance of Carte, whose venial errors
he has so rigorously chastised.]

[Footnote 137: The antiquities of Bretagne, which have been the subject
even of political controversy, are illustrated by Hadrian Valesius,
(Notitia Galliarum, sub voce Britannia Cismarina, p. 98-100.) M.
D'Anville, (Notice de l'Ancienne Gaule, Corisopiti, Curiosolites,
Osismii, Vorganium, p. 248, 258, 508, 720, and Etats de l'Europe, p.
76-80,) Longuerue, (Description de la France, tom. i. p. 84-94,) and the
Abbe de Vertot, (Hist. Critique de l'Etablissement des Bretons dans
les Gaules, 2 vols. in 12 mo., Paris, 1720.) I may assume the merit
of examining the original evidence which they have produced. * Note:
Compare Gallet, Memoires sur la Bretagne, and Daru, Histoire de
Bretagne. These authors appear to me to establish the point of the
independence of Bretagne at the time that the insular Britons took
refuge in their country, and that the greater part landed as fugitives
rather than as conquerors. I observe that M. Lappenberg (Geschichte von
England, vol. i. p. 56) supposes the settlement of a military colony
formed of British soldiers, (Milites limitanei, laeti,) during the
usurpation of Maximus, (381, 388,) who gave their name and peculiar
civilization to Bretagne. M. Lappenberg expresses his surprise that
Gibbon here rejects the authority which he follows elsewhere.--M.]
