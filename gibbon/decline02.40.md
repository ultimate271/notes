## Chapter XXIII: Reign Of Julian.--Part III.

In the midst of a rocky and barren country, the walls of Jerusalem [59]
enclosed the two mountains of Sion and Acra, within an oval figure of
about three English miles. [60] Towards the south, the upper town, and
the fortress of David, were erected on the lofty ascent of Mount Sion:
on the north side, the buildings of the lower town covered the spacious
summit of Mount Acra; and a part of the hill, distinguished by the name
of Moriah, and levelled by human industry, was crowned with the stately
temple of the Jewish nation. After the final destruction of the temple
by the arms of Titus and Hadrian, a ploughshare was drawn over the
consecrated ground, as a sign of perpetual interdiction. Sion was
deserted; and the vacant space of the lower city was filled with
the public and private edifices of the Aelian colony, which spread
themselves over the adjacent hill of Calvary. The holy places were
polluted with mountains of idolatry; and, either from design or
accident, a chapel was dedicated to Venus, on the spot which had been
sanctified by the death and resurrection of Christ. [61] [61a] Almost
three hundred years after those stupendous events, the profane chapel of
Venus was demolished by the order of Constantine; and the removal of the
earth and stones revealed the holy sepulchre to the eyes of mankind.
A magnificent church was erected on that mystic ground, by the first
Christian emperor; and the effects of his pious munificence were
extended to every spot which had been consecrated by the footstep of
patriarchs, of prophets, and of the Son of God. [62]

[Footnote 59: Reland (Palestin. l. i. p. 309, 390, l. iii. p. 838)
describes, with learning and perspicuity, Jerusalem, and the face of the
adjacent country.]

[Footnote 60: I have consulted a rare and curious treatise of M.
D'Anville, (sur l'Ancienne Jerusalem, Paris, 1747, p. 75.) The
circumference of the ancient city (Euseb. Preparat. Evangel. l. ix. c.
36) was 27 stadia, or 2550 toises. A plan, taken on the spot, assigns
no more than 1980 for the modern town. The circuit is defined by natural
landmarks, which cannot be mistaken or removed.]

[Footnote 61: See two curious passages in Jerom, (tom. i. p. 102, tom.
vi. p. 315,) and the ample details of Tillemont, (Hist, des Empereurs,
tom. i. p. 569. tom. ii. p. 289, 294, 4to edition.)]

[Footnote 61a: On the site of the Holy Sepulchre, compare the chapter
in Professor Robinson's Travels in Palestine, which has renewed the old
controversy with great vigor. To me, this temple of Venus, said to
have been erected by Hadrian to insult the Christians, is not the least
suspicious part of the whole legend.-M. 1845.]

[Footnote 62: Eusebius in Vit. Constantin. l. iii. c. 25-47, 51-53. The
emperor likewise built churches at Bethlem, the Mount of Olives, and the
oa of Mambre. The holy sepulchre is described by Sandys, (Travels, p.
125-133,) and curiously delineated by Le Bruyn, (Voyage au Levant, p.
28-296.)]

The passionate desire of contemplating the original monuments of their
redemption attracted to Jerusalem a successive crowd of pilgrims, from
the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, and the most distant countries of the
East; [63] and their piety was authorized by the example of the empress
Helena, who appears to have united the credulity of age with the warm
feelings of a recent conversion. Sages and heroes, who have visited
the memorable scenes of ancient wisdom or glory, have confessed the
inspiration of the genius of the place; [64] and the Christian who knelt
before the holy sepulchre, ascribed his lively faith, and his fervent
devotion, to the more immediate influence of the Divine Spirit. The
zeal, perhaps the avarice, of the clergy of Jerusalem, cherished and
multiplied these beneficial visits. They fixed, by unquestionable
tradition, the scene of each memorable event. They exhibited the
instruments which had been used in the passion of Christ; the nails and
the lance that had pierced his hands, his feet, and his side; the crown
of thorns that was planted on his head; the pillar at which he was
scourged; and, above all, they showed the cross on which he suffered,
and which was dug out of the earth in the reign of those princes, who
inserted the symbol of Christianity in the banners of the Roman legions.
[65] Such miracles as seemed necessary to account for its extraordinary
preservation, and seasonable discovery, were gradually propagated
without opposition. The custody of the true cross, which on Easter
Sunday was solemnly exposed to the people, was intrusted to the bishop
of Jerusalem; and he alone might gratify the curious devotion of the
pilgrims, by the gift of small pieces, which they encased in gold or
gems, and carried away in triumph to their respective countries. But as
this gainful branch of commerce must soon have been annihilated, it was
found convenient to suppose, that the marvelous wood possessed a
secret power of vegetation; and that its substance, though continually
diminished, still remained entire and unimpaired. [66] It might perhaps
have been expected, that the influence of the place and the belief of
a perpetual miracle, should have produced some salutary effects on the
morals, as well as on the faith, of the people. Yet the most respectable
of the ecclesiastical writers have been obliged to confess, not only
that the streets of Jerusalem were filled with the incessant tumult of
business and pleasure, [67] but that every species of vice--adultery,
theft, idolatry, poisoning, murder--was familiar to the inhabitants
of the holy city. [68] The wealth and preeminence of the church
of Jerusalem excited the ambition of Arian, as well as orthodox,
candidates; and the virtues of Cyril, who, since his death, has been
honored with the title of Saint, were displayed in the exercise, rather
than in the acquisition, of his episcopal dignity. [69]

[Footnote 63: The Itinerary from Bourdeaux to Jerusalem was composed in
the year 333, for the use of pilgrims; among whom Jerom (tom. i. p. 126)
mentions the Britons and the Indians. The causes of this superstitious
fashion are discussed in the learned and judicious preface of Wesseling.
(Itinarar. p. 537-545.) ----Much curious information on this subject is
collected in the first chapter of Wilken, Geschichte der Kreuzzuge.--M.]

[Footnote 64: Cicero (de Finibus, v. 1) has beautifully expressed the
common sense of mankind.]

[Footnote 65: Baronius (Annal. Eccles. A. D. 326, No. 42-50) and
Tillemont (Mem. Eccles. tom. xii. p. 8-16) are the historians and
champions of the miraculous invention of the cross, under the reign of
Constantine. Their oldest witnesses are Paulinus, Sulpicius Severus,
Rufinus, Ambrose, and perhaps Cyril of Jerusalem. The silence of
Eusebius, and the Bourdeaux pilgrim, which satisfies those who think
perplexes those who believe. See Jortin's sensible remarks, vol. ii. p
238-248.]

[Footnote 66: This multiplication is asserted by Paulinus, (Epist.
xxxvi. See Dupin. Bibliot. Eccles. tom. iii. p. 149,) who seems to
have improved a rhetorical flourish of Cyril into a real fact. The same
supernatural privilege must have been communicated to the Virgin's
milk, (Erasmi Opera, tom. i. p. 778, Lugd. Batav. 1703, in Colloq. de
Peregrinat. Religionis ergo,) saints' heads, &c. and other relics, which
are repeated in so many different churches. * Note: Lord Mahon, in a
memoir read before the Society of Antiquaries, (Feb. 1831,) has traced
in a brief but interesting manner, the singular adventures of the "true"
cross. It is curious to inquire, what authority we have, except of
late tradition, for the Hill of Calvary. There is none in the sacred
writings; the uniform use of the common word, instead of any word
expressing assent or acclivity, is against the notion.--M.]

[Footnote 67: Jerom, (tom. i. p. 103,) who resided in the neighboring
village of Bethlem, describes the vices of Jerusalem from his personal
experience.]

[Footnote 68: Gregor. Nyssen, apud Wesseling, p. 539. The whole epistle,
which condemns either the use or the abuse of religious pilgrimage, is
painful to the Catholic divines, while it is dear and familiar to our
Protestant polemics.]

[Footnote 69: He renounced his orthodox ordination, officiated as
a deacon, and was re-ordained by the hands of the Arians. But Cyril
afterwards changed with the times, and prudently conformed to the Nicene
faith. Tillemont, (Mem. Eccles. tom. viii.,) who treats his memory with
tenderness and respect, has thrown his virtues into the text, and his
faults into the notes, in decent obscurity, at the end of the volume.]

The vain and ambitious mind of Julian might aspire to restore the
ancient glory of the temple of Jerusalem. [70] As the Christians were
firmly persuaded that a sentence of everlasting destruction had been
pronounced against the whole fabric of the Mosaic law, the Imperial
sophist would have converted the success of his undertaking into a
specious argument against the faith of prophecy, and the truth of
revelation. [71] He was displeased with the spiritual worship of the
synagogue; but he approved the institutions of Moses, who had not
disdained to adopt many of the rites and ceremonies of Egypt. [72]
The local and national deity of the Jews was sincerely adored by a
polytheist, who desired only to multiply the number of the gods; [73]
and such was the appetite of Julian for bloody sacrifice, that his
emulation might be excited by the piety of Solomon, who had offered, at
the feast of the dedication, twenty-two thousand oxen, and one hundred
and twenty thousand sheep. [74] These considerations might influence his
designs; but the prospect of an immediate and important advantage would
not suffer the impatient monarch to expect the remote and uncertain
event of the Persian war. He resolved to erect, without delay, on the
commanding eminence of Moriah, a stately temple, which might eclipse
the splendor of the church of the resurrection on the adjacent hill of
Calvary; to establish an order of priests, whose interested zeal would
detect the arts, and resist the ambition, of their Christian rivals;
and to invite a numerous colony of Jews, whose stern fanaticism would be
always prepared to second, and even to anticipate, the hostile measures
of the Pagan government. Among the friends of the emperor (if the names
of emperor, and of friend, are not incompatible) the first place was
assigned, by Julian himself, to the virtuous and learned Alypius.
[75] The humanity of Alypius was tempered by severe justice and
manly fortitude; and while he exercised his abilities in the civil
administration of Britain, he imitated, in his poetical compositions,
the harmony and softness of the odes of Sappho. This minister, to whom
Julian communicated, without reserve, his most careless levities, and
his most serious counsels, received an extraordinary commission to
restore, in its pristine beauty, the temple of Jerusalem; and the
diligence of Alypius required and obtained the strenuous support of the
governor of Palestine. At the call of their great deliverer, the Jews,
from all the provinces of the empire, assembled on the holy mountain of
their fathers; and their insolent triumph alarmed and exasperated the
Christian inhabitants of Jerusalem. The desire of rebuilding the temple
has in every age been the ruling passion of the children of Israel. In
this propitious moment the men forgot their avarice, and the women their
delicacy; spades and pickaxes of silver were provided by the vanity of
the rich, and the rubbish was transported in mantles of silk and purple.
Every purse was opened in liberal contributions, every hand claimed
a share in the pious labor, and the commands of a great monarch were
executed by the enthusiasm of a whole people. [76]

[Footnote 70: Imperii sui memoriam magnitudine operum gestiens propagare
Ammian. xxiii. 1. The temple of Jerusalem had been famous even among the
Gentiles. They had many temples in each city, (at Sichem five, at
Gaza eight, at Rome four hundred and twenty-four;) but the wealth and
religion of the Jewish nation was centred in one spot.]

[Footnote 71: The secret intentions of Julian are revealed by the late
bishop of Gloucester, the learned and dogmatic Warburton; who, with the
authority of a theologian, prescribes the motives and conduct of the
Supreme Being. The discourse entitled Julian (2d edition, London, 1751)
is strongly marked with all the peculiarities which are imputed to the
Warburtonian school.]

[Footnote 72: I shelter myself behind Maimonides, Marsham, Spencer, Le
Clerc, Warburton, &c., who have fairly derided the fears, the folly, and
the falsehood of some superstitious divines. See Divine Legation, vol.
iv. p. 25, &c.]

[Footnote 73: Julian (Fragment. p. 295) respectfully styles him, and
mentions him elsewhere (Epist. lxiii.) with still higher reverence. He
doubly condemns the Christians for believing, and for renouncing, the
religion of the Jews. Their Deity was a true, but not the only, God Apul
Cyril. l. ix. p. 305, 306.]

and smoke of so many hecatombs might be inconvenient, Lightfoot, the

enough to suspect to fidelity of the numbers. * Note: According to the
historian Kotobeddym, quoted by Burckhardt, (Travels in Arabia, p. 276,)
the Khalif Mokteder sacrificed, during his pilgrimage to Mecca, in
the year of the Hejira 350, forty thousand camels and cows, and fifty
thousand sheep. Barthema describes thirty thousand oxen slain, and their
carcasses given to the poor. Quarterly Review, xiii.p.39--M.]

Nazianzen (Orat. iv. p. 111) and Theodoret. (l. iii. c. 20.)]

Yet, on this occasion, the joint efforts of power and enthusiasm were
unsuccessful; and the ground of the Jewish temple, which is now covered
by a Mahometan mosque, [77] still continued to exhibit the same edifying
spectacle of ruin and desolation. Perhaps the absence and death of the
emperor, and the new maxims of a Christian reign, might explain the
interruption of an arduous work, which was attempted only in the last
six months of the life of Julian. [78] But the Christians entertained
a natural and pious expectation, that, in this memorable contest,
the honor of religion would be vindicated by some signal miracle. An
earthquake, a whirlwind, and a fiery eruption, which overturned and
scattered the new foundations of the temple, are attested, with some
variations, by contemporary and respectable evidence. [79] This public
event is described by Ambrose, [80] bishop of Milan, in an epistle to
the emperor Theodosius, which must provoke the severe animadversion
of the Jews; by the eloquent Chrysostom, [81] who might appeal to the
memory of the elder part of his congregation at Antioch; and by Gregory
Nazianzen, [82] who published his account of the miracle before the
expiration of the same year. The last of these writers has boldly
declared, that this preternatural event was not disputed by the
infidels; and his assertion, strange as it may seem is confirmed by the
unexceptionable testimony of Ammianus Marcellinus. [83] The philosophic
soldier, who loved the virtues, without adopting the prejudices, of his
master, has recorded, in his judicious and candid history of his own
times, the extraordinary obstacles which interrupted the restoration of
the temple of Jerusalem. "Whilst Alypius, assisted by the governor of
the province, urged, with vigor and diligence, the execution of the
work, horrible balls of fire breaking out near the foundations, with
frequent and reiterated attacks, rendered the place, from time to time,
inaccessible to the scorched and blasted workmen; and the victorious
element continuing in this manner obstinately and resolutely bent, as it
were, to drive them to a distance, the undertaking was abandoned."
[83a] Such authority should satisfy a believing, and must astonish an
incredulous, mind. Yet a philosopher may still require the original
evidence of impartial and intelligent spectators. At this important
crisis, any singular accident of nature would assume the appearance, and
produce the effects of a real prodigy. This glorious deliverance would
be speedily improved and magnified by the pious art of the clergy of
Jerusalem, and the active credulity of the Christian world and, at the
distance of twenty years, a Roman historian, care less of theological
disputes, might adorn his work with the specious and splendid miracle.

great mosque covers the whole consecrated ground of the Jewish temple,
and constitutes almost a square of 760 toises, or one Roman mile in
circumference. See D'Anville, Jerusalem, p. 45.]

[Footnote 78: Ammianus records the consults of the year 363, before
he proceeds to mention the thoughts of Julian. Templum. ... instaurare
sumptibus cogitabat immodicis. Warburton has a secret wish to anticipate
the design; but he must have understood, from former examples, that the
execution of such a work would have demanded many years.]

[Footnote 79: The subsequent witnesses, Socrates, Sozomen, Theodoret,
Philostorgius, &c., add contradictions rather than authority. Compare
the objections of Basnage (Hist. des Juifs, tom. viii. p. 156-168) with
Warburton's answers, (Julian, p. 174-258.) The bishop has ingeniously
explained the miraculous crosses which appeared on the garments of the
spectators by a similar instance, and the natural effects of lightning.]

composed this fanatic epistle (A. D. 388) to justify a bishop who had
been condemned by the civil magistrate for burning a synagogue.]

the composition of these sermons in the year 383, is confident they were
never pronounced from the pulpit.]

cessavit inceptum. Warburton labors (p. 60-90) to extort a confession
of the miracle from the mouths of Julian and Libanius, and to employ the
evidence of a rabbi who lived in the fifteenth century. Such witnesses
can only be received by a very favorable judge.]

[Footnote 83a: Michaelis has given an ingenious and sufficiently
probable explanation of this remarkable incident, which the positive
testimony of Ammianus, a contemporary and a pagan, will not permit us
to call in question. It was suggested by a passage in Tacitus. That
historian, speaking of Jerusalem, says, [I omit the first part of the
quotation adduced by M. Guizot, which only by a most extraordinary
mistranslation of muri introrsus sinuati by "enfoncemens" could be made
to bear on the question.--M.] The Temple itself was a kind of citadel,
which had its own walls, superior in their workmanship and construction
to those of the city. The porticos themselves, which surrounded the
temple, were an excellent fortification. There was a fountain of
constantly running water; subterranean excavations under the mountain;
reservoirs and cisterns to collect the rain-water. Tac. Hist. v. ii.
12. These excavations and reservoirs must have been very considerable.
The latter furnished water during the whole siege of Jerusalem to
1,100,000 inhabitants, for whom the fountain of Siloe could not have
sufficed, and who had no fresh rain-water, the siege having taken place
from the month of April to the month of August, a period of the year
during which it rarely rains in Jerusalem. As to the excavations, they
served after, and even before, the return of the Jews from Babylon,
to contain not only magazines of oil, wine, and corn, but also the
treasures which were laid up in the Temple. Josephus has related several
incidents which show their extent. When Jerusalem was on the point of
being taken by Titus, the rebel chiefs, placing their last hopes
in these vast subterranean cavities, formed a design of concealing
themselves there, and remaining during the conflagration of the city,
and until the Romans had retired to a distance. The greater part had not
time to execute their design; but one of them, Simon, the Son of Gioras,
having provided himself with food, and tools to excavate the earth
descended into this retreat with some companions: he remained there till
Titus had set out for Rome: under the pressure of famine he issued forth
on a sudden in the very place where the Temple had stood, and appeared
in the midst of the Roman guard. He was seized and carried to Rome for
the triumph. His appearance made it be suspected that other Jews
might have chosen the same asylum; search was made, and a great number
discovered. Joseph. de Bell. Jud. l. vii. c. 2. It is probable that
the greater part of these excavations were the remains of the time of
Solomon, when it was the custom to work to a great extent under ground:
no other date can be assigned to them. The Jews, on their return from
the captivity, were too poor to undertake such works; and, although
Herod, on rebuilding the Temple, made some excavations, (Joseph. Ant.
Jud. xv. 11, vii.,) the haste with which that building was completed
will not allow us to suppose that they belonged to that period. Some
were used for sewers and drains, others served to conceal the immense
treasures of which Crassus, a hundred and twenty years before, plundered
the Jews, and which doubtless had been since replaced. The Temple was
destroyed A. C. 70; the attempt of Julian to rebuild it, and the fact
related by Ammianus, coincide with the year 363. There had then elapsed
between these two epochs an interval of near 300 years, during which the
excavations, choked up with ruins, must have become full of inflammable
air. The workmen employed by Julian as they were digging, arrived at
the excavations of the Temple; they would take torches to explore them;
sudden flames repelled those who approached; explosions were heard, and
these phenomena were renewed every time that they penetrated into new
subterranean passages. This explanation is confirmed by the relation
of an event nearly similar, by Josephus. King Herod having heard that
immense treasures had been concealed in the sepulchre of David, he
descended into it with a few confidential persons; he found in the first
subterranean chamber only jewels and precious stuffs: but having wished
to penetrate into a second chamber, which had been long closed, he
was repelled, when he opened it, by flames which killed those who
accompanied him. (Ant. Jud. xvi. 7, i.) As here there is no room for
miracle, this fact may be considered as a new proof of the veracity of
that related by Ammianus and the contemporary writers.--G. ----To the
illustrations of the extent of the subterranean chambers adduced by
Michaelis, may be added, that when John of Gischala, during the siege,
surprised the Temple, the party of Eleazar took refuge within them.
Bell. Jud. vi. 3, i. The sudden sinking of the hill of Sion when
Jerusalem was occupied by Barchocab, may have been connected with
similar excavations. Hist. of Jews, vol. iii. 122 and 186.--M. ----It is
a fact now popularly known, that when mines which have been long closed
are opened, one of two things takes place; either the torches are
extinguished and the men fall first into a swoor and soon die; or, if
the air is inflammable, a little flame is seen to flicker round the
lamp, which spreads and multiplies till the conflagration becomes
general, is followed by an explosion, and kill all who are in the
way.--G.]

[Footnote 84: Dr. Lardner, perhaps alone of the Christian critics,
presumes to doubt the truth of this famous miracle. (Jewish and Heathen
Testimonies, vol. iv. p. 47-71.)]

The silence of Jerom would lead to a suspicion that the same story which
was celebrated at a distance, might be despised on the spot. * Note:
Gibbon has forgotten Basnage, to whom Warburton replied.--M.
