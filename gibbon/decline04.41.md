## Chapter XLVII: Ecclesiastical Discord.--Part V.

I. Both in his native and his episcopal province, the heresy of the
unfortunate Nestorius was speedily obliterated. The Oriental bishops,
who at Ephesus had resisted to his face the arrogance of Cyril,
were mollified by his tardy concessions. The same prelates, or their
successors, subscribed, not without a murmur, the decrees of Chalcedon;
the power of the Monophysites reconciled them with the Catholics in
the conformity of passion, of interest, and, insensibly, of belief;
and their last reluctant sigh was breathed in the defence of the three
chapters. Their dissenting brethren, less moderate, or more sincere,
were crushed by the penal laws; and, as early as the reign of Justinian,
it became difficult to find a church of Nestorians within the limits of
the Roman empire. Beyond those limits they had discovered a new world,
in which they might hope for liberty, and aspire to conquest. In Persia,
notwithstanding the resistance of the Magi, Christianity had struck a
deep root, and the nations of the East reposed under its salutary shade.
The catholic, or primate, resided in the capital: in his synods, and in
their dioceses, his metropolitans, bishops, and clergy, represented the
pomp and order of a regular hierarchy: they rejoiced in the increase of
proselytes, who were converted from the Zendavesta to the gospel, from
the secular to the monastic life; and their zeal was stimulated by the
presence of an artful and formidable enemy. The Persian church had been
founded by the missionaries of Syria; and their language, discipline,
and doctrine, were closely interwoven with its original frame. The
catholics were elected and ordained by their own suffragans; but their
filial dependence on the patriarchs of Antioch is attested by the canons
of the Oriental church. [113] In the Persian school of Edessa, [114] the
rising generations of the faithful imbibed their theological idiom: they
studied in the Syriac version the ten thousand volumes of Theodore of
Mopsuestia; and they revered the apostolic faith and holy martyrdom of
his disciple Nestorius, whose person and language were equally unknown
to the nations beyond the Tigris. The first indelible lesson of Ibas,
bishop of Edessa, taught them to execrate the Egyptians, who, in the
synod of Ephesus, had impiously confounded the two natures of Christ.
The flight of the masters and scholars, who were twice expelled from
the Athens of Syria, dispersed a crowd of missionaries inflamed by
the double zeal of religion and revenge. And the rigid unity of the
Monophysites, who, under the reigns of Zeno and Anastasius, had invaded
the thrones of the East, provoked their antagonists, in a land of
freedom, to avow a moral, rather than a physical, union of the two
persons of Christ. Since the first preaching of the gospel, the
Sassanian kings beheld with an eye of suspicion a race of aliens and
apostates, who had embraced the religion, and who might favor the cause,
of the hereditary foes of their country. The royal edicts had often
prohibited their dangerous correspondence with the Syrian clergy: the
progress of the schism was grateful to the jealous pride of Perozes, and
he listened to the eloquence of an artful prelate, who painted Nestorius
as the friend of Persia, and urged him to secure the fidelity of his
Christian subjects, by granting a just preference to the victims and
enemies of the Roman tyrant. The Nestorians composed a large majority of
the clergy and people: they were encouraged by the smile, and armed with
the sword, of despotism; yet many of their weaker brethren were startled
at the thought of breaking loose from the communion of the Christian
world, and the blood of seven thousand seven hundred Monophysites,
or Catholics, confirmed the uniformity of faith and discipline in
the churches of Persia. [115] Their ecclesiastical institutions are
distinguished by a liberal principle of reason, or at least of policy:
the austerity of the cloister was relaxed and gradually forgotten;
houses of charity were endowed for the education of orphans and
foundlings; the law of celibacy, so forcibly recommended to the Greeks
and Latins, was disregarded by the Persian clergy; and the number of
the elect was multiplied by the public and reiterated nuptials of the
priests, the bishops, and even the patriarch himself. To this standard
of natural and religious freedom, myriads of fugitives resorted from all
the provinces of the Eastern empire; the narrow bigotry of Justinian
was punished by the emigration of his most industrious subjects; they
transported into Persia the arts both of peace and war: and those
who deserved the favor, were promoted in the service, of a discerning
monarch. The arms of Nushirvan, and his fiercer grandson, were assisted
with advice, and money, and troops, by the desperate sectaries who still
lurked in their native cities of the East: their zeal was rewarded with
the gift of the Catholic churches; but when those cities and churches
were recovered by Heraclius, their open profession of treason and heresy
compelled them to seek a refuge in the realm of their foreign ally. But
the seeming tranquillity of the Nestorians was often endangered, and
sometimes overthrown. They were involved in the common evils of Oriental
despotism: their enmity to Rome could not always atone for their
attachment to the gospel: and a colony of three hundred thousand
Jacobites, the captives of Apamea and Antioch, was permitted to erect
a hostile altar in the face of the catholic, and in the sunshine of the
court. In his last treaty, Justinian introduced some conditions which
tended to enlarge and fortify the toleration of Christianity in Persia.
The emperor, ignorant of the rights of conscience, was incapable of pity
or esteem for the heretics who denied the authority of the holy synods:
but he flattered himself that they would gradually perceive the temporal
benefits of union with the empire and the church of Rome; and if
he failed in exciting their gratitude, he might hope to provoke the
jealousy of their sovereign. In a later age the Lutherans have been
burnt at Paris, and protected in Germany, by the superstition and policy
of the most Christian king.

[Footnote 113: See the Arabic canons of Nice in the translation of
Abraham Ecchelensis, No. 37, 38, 39, 40. Concil. tom. ii. p. 335,
336, edit. Venet. These vulgar titles, Nicene and Arabic, are both
apocryphal. The council of Nice enacted no more than twenty canons,
(Theodoret. Hist. Eccles. l. i. c. 8;) and the remainder, seventy or
eighty, were collected from the synods of the Greek church. The Syriac
edition of Maruthas is no longer extant, (Asseman. Bibliot. Oriental.
tom. i. p. 195, tom. iii. p. 74,) and the Arabic version is marked with
many recent interpolations. Yet this Code contains many curious relics
of ecclesiastical discipline; and since it is equally revered by all the
Eastern communions, it was probably finished before the schism of
the Nestorians and Jacobites, (Fabric. Bibliot. Graec. tom. xi. p.
363--367.)]

[Footnote 114: Theodore the Reader (l. ii. c. 5, 49, ad calcem Hist.
Eccles.) has noticed this Persian school of Edessa. Its ancient
splendor, and the two aeras of its downfall, (A.D. 431 and 489) are
clearly discussed by Assemanni, (Biblioth. Orient. tom. ii. p. 402, iii.
p. 376, 378, iv. p. 70, 924.)]

[Footnote 115: A dissertation on the state of the Nestorians has swelled
in the bands of Assemanni to a folio volume of 950 pages, and his
learned researches are digested in the most lucid order. Besides this
ivth volume of the Bibliotheca Orientalis, the extracts in the three
preceding tomes (tom. i. p. 203, ii. p. 321-463, iii. 64--70, 378--395,
&c., 405--408, 580--589) may be usefully consulted.]

The desire of gaining souls for God and subjects for the church, has
excited in every age the diligence of the Christian priests. From the
conquest of Persia they carried their spiritual arms to the north, the
east, and the south; and the simplicity of the gospel was fashioned and
painted with the colors of the Syriac theology. In the sixth century,
according to the report of a Nestorian traveller, [116] Christianity
was successfully preached to the Bactrians, the Huns, the Persians, the
Indians, the Persarmenians, the Medes, and the Elamites: the Barbaric
churches, from the Gulf of Persia to the Caspian Sea, were almost
infinite; and their recent faith was conspicuous in the number and
sanctity of their monks and martyrs. The pepper coast of Malabar,
and the isles of the ocean, Socotora and Ceylon, were peopled with an
increasing multitude of Christians; and the bishops and clergy of
those sequestered regions derived their ordination from the Catholic of
Babylon. In a subsequent age the zeal of the Nestorians overleaped the
limits which had confined the ambition and curiosity both of the Greeks
and Persians. The missionaries of Balch and Samarcand pursued without
fear the footsteps of the roving Tartar, and insinuated themselves into
the camps of the valleys of Imaus and the banks of the Selinga. They
exposed a metaphysical creed to those illiterate shepherds: to those
sanguinary warriors, they recommended humanity and repose. Yet a khan,
whose power they vainly magnified, is said to have received at their
hands the rites of baptism, and even of ordination; and the fame of
Prester or Presbyter John [117] has long amused the credulity of Europe.
The royal convert was indulged in the use of a portable altar; but he
despatched an embassy to the patriarch, to inquire how, in the season of
Lent, he should abstain from animal food, and how he might celebrate
the Eucharist in a desert that produced neither corn nor wine. In their
progress by sea and land, the Nestorians entered China by the port of
Canton and the northern residence of Sigan. Unlike the senators of
Rome, who assumed with a smile the characters of priests and augurs, the
mandarins, who affect in public the reason of philosophers, are devoted
in private to every mode of popular superstition. They cherished and
they confounded the gods of Palestine and of India; but the propagation
of Christianity awakened the jealousy of the state, and, after a short
vicissitude of favor and persecution, the foreign sect expired in
ignorance and oblivion. [118] Under the reign of the caliphs, the
Nestorian church was diffused from China to Jerusalem and Cyrus; and
their numbers, with those of the Jacobites, were computed to surpass
the Greek and Latin communions. [119] Twenty-five metropolitans
or archbishops composed their hierarchy; but several of these were
dispensed, by the distance and danger of the way, from the duty of
personal attendance, on the easy condition that every six years they
should testify their faith and obedience to the catholic or patriarch of
Babylon, a vague appellation which has been successively applied to the
royal seats of Seleucia, Ctesiphon, and Bagdad. These remote branches
are long since withered; and the old patriarchal trunk [120] is now
divided by the Elijahs of Mosul, the representatives almost on lineal
descent of the genuine and primitive succession; the Josephs of Amida,
who are reconciled to the church of Rome: [121] and the Simeons of Van
or Ormia, whose revolt, at the head of forty thousand families, was
promoted in the sixteenth century by the Sophis of Persia. The number of
three hundred thousand is allowed for the whole body of the Nestorians,
who, under the name of Chaldeans or Assyrians, are confounded with the
most learned or the most powerful nation of Eastern antiquity.

[Footnote 116: See the Topographia Christiana of Cosmas, surnamed
Indicopleustes, or the Indian navigator, l. iii. p. 178, 179, l. xi.
p. 337. The entire work, of which some curious extracts may be found in
Photius, (cod. xxxvi. p. 9, 10, edit. Hoeschel,) Thevenot, (in the 1st
part of his Relation des Voyages, &c.,) and Fabricius, (Bibliot. Graec.
l. iii. c. 25, tom. ii. p. 603-617,) has been published by Father
Montfaucon at Paris, 1707, in the Nova Collectio Patrum, (tom. ii. p.
113--346.) It was the design of the author to confute the impious heresy
of those who maintained that the earth is a globe, and not a flat,
oblong table, as it is represented in the Scriptures, (l. ii. p. 138.)
But the nonsense of the monk is mingled with the practical knowledge of
the traveller, who performed his voyage A.D. 522, and published his book
at Alexandria, A.D. 547, (l. ii. p. 140, 141. Montfaucon, Praefat.
c. 2.) The Nestorianism of Cosmas, unknown to his learned editor, was
detected by La Croze, (Christianisme des Indes, tom. i. p. 40--55,) and
is confirmed by Assemanni, (Bibliot. Orient. tom. iv. p. 605, 606.)]

[Footnote 117: In its long progress to Mosul, Jerusalem, Rome, &c., the
story of Prester John evaporated in a monstrous fable, of which some
features have been borrowed from the Lama of Thibet, (Hist. Genealogique
des Tartares, P. ii. p. 42. Hist. de Gengiscan, p. 31, &c.,) and were
ignorantly transferred by the Portuguese to the emperor of Abyssinia,
(Ludolph. Hist. Aethiop. Comment. l. ii. c. 1.) Yet it is probable that
in the xith and xiith centuries, Nestorian Christianity was professed
in the horde of the Keraites, (D'Herbelot, p. 256, 915, 959. Assemanni,
tom. iv. p. 468--504.) Note: The extent to which Nestorian Christianity
prevailed among the Tartar tribes is one of the most curious questions
in Oriental history. M. Schmidt (Geschichte der Ost Mongolen, notes,
p. 383) appears to question the Christianity of Ong Chaghan, and his
Keraite subjects.--M.]

[Footnote 118: The Christianity of China, between the seventh and the
thirteenth century, is invincibly proved by the consent of Chinese,
Arabian, Syriac, and Latin evidence, (Assemanni, Biblioth. Orient.
tom. iv. p. 502--552. Mem. de l'Academie des Inscript. tom. xxx. p.
802--819.) The inscription of Siganfu which describes the fortunes of
the Nestorian church, from the first mission, A.D. 636, to the current
year 781, is accused of forgery by La Croze, Voltaire, &c., who become
the dupes of their own cunning, while they are afraid of a Jesuitical
fraud. * Note: This famous monument, the authenticity of which many have
attempted to impeach, rather from hatred to the Jesuits, by whom it
was made known, than by a candid examination of its contents, is now
generally considered above all suspicion. The Chinese text and the facts
which it relates are equally strong proofs of its authenticity. This
monument was raised as a memorial of the establishment of Christianity
in China. It is dated the year 1092 of the era of the Greeks, or the
Seleucidae, A.D. 781, in the time of the Nestorian patriarch Anan-jesu.
It was raised by Iezdbouzid, priest and chorepiscopus of Chumdan, that
is, of the capital of the Chinese empire, and the son of a priest who
came from Balkh in Tokharistan. Among the various arguments which may be
urged in favor of the authenticity of this monument, and which has not
yet been advanced, may be reckoned the name of the priest by whom it
was raised. The name is Persian, and at the time the monument was
discovered, it would have been impossible to have imagined it; for there
was no work extant from whence the knowledge of it could be derived. I
do not believe that ever since this period, any book has been published
in which it can be found a second time. It is very celebrated amongst
the Armenians, and is derived from a martyr, a Persian by birth, of the
royal race, who perished towards the middle of the seventh century, and
rendered his name celebrated among the Christian nations of the East.
St. Martin, vol. i. p. 69. M. Remusat has also strongly expressed his
conviction of the authenticity of this monument. Melanges Asiatiques,
P. i. p. 33. Yet M. Schmidt (Geschichte der Ost Mongolen, p. 384) denies
that there is any satisfactory proof that much a monument was ever found
in China, or that it was not manufactured in Europe. But if the Jesuits
had attempted such a forgery, would it not have been more adapted to
further their peculiar views?--M.]

According to the legend of antiquity, the gospel was preached in India
by St. Thomas. [122] At the end of the ninth century, his shrine,
perhaps in the neighborhood of Madras, was devoutly visited by the
ambassadors of Alfred; and their return with a cargo of pearls and
spices rewarded the zeal of the English monarch, who entertained the
largest projects of trade and discovery. [123] When the Portuguese first
opened the navigation of India, the Christians of St. Thomas had been
seated for ages on the coast of Malabar, and the difference of their
character and color attested the mixture of a foreign race. In arms, in
arts, and possibly in virtue, they excelled the natives of Hindostan;
the husbandmen cultivated the palm-tree, the merchants were enriched by
the pepper trade, the soldiers preceded the nairs or nobles of Malabar,
and their hereditary privileges were respected by the gratitude or the
fear of the king of Cochin and the Zamorin himself. They acknowledged a
Gentoo of sovereign, but they were governed, even in temporal concerns,
by the bishop of Angamala. He still asserted his ancient title of
metropolitan of India, but his real jurisdiction was exercised in
fourteen hundred churches, and he was intrusted with the care of two
hundred thousand souls. Their religion would have rendered them the
firmest and most cordial allies of the Portuguese; but the inquisitors
soon discerned in the Christians of St. Thomas the unpardonable guilt
of heresy and schism. Instead of owning themselves the subjects of the
Roman pontiff, the spiritual and temporal monarch of the globe, they
adhered, like their ancestors, to the communion of the Nestorian
patriarch; and the bishops whom he ordained at Mosul, traversed the
dangers of the sea and land to reach their diocese on the coast of
Malabar. In their Syriac liturgy the names of Theodore and Nestorius
were piously commemorated: they united their adoration of the two
persons of Christ; the title of Mother of God was offensive to their
ear, and they measured with scrupulous avarice the honors of the Virgin
Mary, whom the superstition of the Latins had almost exalted to the rank
of a goddess. When her image was first presented to the disciples of St.
Thomas, they indignantly exclaimed, "We are Christians, not idolaters!"
and their simple devotion was content with the veneration of the cross.
Their separation from the Western world had left them in ignorance
of the improvements, or corruptions, of a thousand years; and their
conformity with the faith and practice of the fifth century would
equally disappoint the prejudices of a Papist or a Protestant. It was
the first care of the ministers of Rome to intercept all correspondence
with the Nestorian patriarch, and several of his bishops expired in the
prisons of the holy office.

The flock, without a shepherd, was assaulted by the power of the
Portuguese, the arts of the Jesuits, and the zeal of Alexis de Menezes,
archbishop of Goa, in his personal visitation of the coast of Malabar.
The synod of Diamper, at which he presided, consummated the pious work
of the reunion; and rigorously imposed the doctrine and discipline of
the Roman church, without forgetting auricular confession, the strongest
engine of ecclesiastical torture. The memory of Theodore and Nestorius
was condemned, and Malabar was reduced under the dominion of the pope,
of the primate, and of the Jesuits who invaded the see of Angamala
or Cranganor. Sixty years of servitude and hypocrisy were patiently
endured; but as soon as the Portuguese empire was shaken by the courage
and industry of the Dutch, the Nestorians asserted, with vigor and
effect, the religion of their fathers. The Jesuits were incapable of
defending the power which they had abused; the arms of forty thousand
Christians were pointed against their falling tyrants; and the Indian
archdeacon assumed the character of bishop till a fresh supply of
episcopal gifts and Syriac missionaries could be obtained from the
patriarch of Babylon. Since the expulsion of the Portuguese, the
Nestorian creed is freely professed on the coast of Malabar. The trading
companies of Holland and England are the friends of toleration; but
if oppression be less mortifying than contempt, the Christians of St.
Thomas have reason to complain of the cold and silent indifference of
their brethren of Europe. [124]

[Footnote 122: The Indian missionary, St. Thomas, an apostle, a
Manichaean, or an Armenian merchant, (La Croze, Christianisme des Indes,
tom. i. p. 57--70,) was famous, however, as early as the time of Jerom,
(ad Marcellam, epist. 148.) Marco-Polo was informed on the spot that he
suffered martyrdom in the city of Malabar, or Meliapour, a league only
from Madras, (D'Anville, Eclaircissemens sur l'Inde, p. 125,) where the
Portuguese founded an episcopal church under the name of St. Thome, and
where the saint performed an annual miracle, till he was silenced by the
profane neighborhood of the English, (La Croze, tom. ii. p. 7-16.)]

[Footnote 123: Neither the author of the Saxon Chronicle (A.D. 833) not
William of Malmesbury (de Gestis Regum Angliae, l. ii. c. 4, p. 44) were
capable, in the twelfth century, of inventing this extraordinary fact;
they are incapable of explaining the motives and measures of Alfred;
and their hasty notice serves only to provoke our curiosity. William of
Malmesbury feels the difficulty of the enterprise, quod quivis in hoc
saeculo miretur; and I almost suspect that the English ambassadors
collected their cargo and legend in Egypt. The royal author has not
enriched his Orosius (see Barrington's Miscellanies) with an Indian, as
well as a Scandinavian, voyage.]

They have drawn from the same source, the Portuguese and Italian
narratives; and the prejudices of the Jesuits are sufficiently corrected
by those of the Protestants. Note: The St. Thome Christians had excited
great interest in the ancient mind of the admirable Bishop Heber. See
his curious and, to his friends, highly characteristic letter to
Mar Athanasius, Appendix to Journal. The arguments of his friend and
coadjutor, Mr. Robinson, (Last Days of Bishop Heber,) have not
convinced me that the Christianity of India is older than the Nestorian
dispersion.--M]

II. The history of the Monophysites is less copious and interesting than
that of the Nestorians. Under the reigns of Zeno and Anastasius, their
artful leaders surprised the ear of the prince, usurped the thrones of
the East, and crushed on its native soil the school of the Syrians. The
rule of the Monophysite faith was defined with exquisite discretion
by Severus, patriarch of Antioch: he condemned, in the style of the
Henoticon, the adverse heresies of Nestorius; and Eutyches maintained
against the latter the reality of the body of Christ, and constrained
the Greeks to allow that he was a liar who spoke truth. [125] But the
approximation of ideas could not abate the vehemence of passion; each
party was the more astonished that their blind antagonist could dispute
on so trifling a difference; the tyrant of Syria enforced the belief of
his creed, and his reign was polluted with the blood of three hundred
and fifty monks, who were slain, not perhaps without provocation or
resistance, under the walls of Apamea. [126] The successor of Anastasius
replanted the orthodox standard in the East; Severus fled into Egypt;
and his friend, the eloquent Xenaias, [127] who had escaped from the
Nestorians of Persia, was suffocated in his exile by the Melchites of
Paphlagonia. Fifty-four bishops were swept from their thrones, eight
hundred ecclesiastics were cast into prison, [128] and notwithstanding
the ambiguous favor of Theodora, the Oriental flocks, deprived of their
shepherds, must insensibly have been either famished or poisoned. In
this spiritual distress, the expiring faction was revived, and united,
and perpetuated, by the labors of a monk; and the name of James
Baradaeus [129] has been preserved in the appellation of Jacobites, a
familiar sound, which may startle the ear of an English reader. From
the holy confessors in their prison of Constantinople, he received the
powers of bishop of Edessa and apostle of the East, and the ordination
of fourscore thousand bishops, priests, and deacons, is derived from
the same inexhaustible source. The speed of the zealous missionary was
promoted by the fleetest dromedaries of a devout chief of the Arabs; the
doctrine and discipline of the Jacobites were secretly established in
the dominions of Justinian; and each Jacobite was compelled to violate
the laws and to hate the Roman legislator. The successors of Severus,
while they lurked in convents or villages, while they sheltered
their proscribed heads in the caverns of hermits, or the tents of the
Saracens, still asserted, as they now assert, their indefeasible right
to the title, the rank, and the prerogatives of patriarch of Antioch:
under the milder yoke of the infidels, they reside about a league
from Merdin, in the pleasant monastery of Zapharan, which they have
embellished with cells, aqueducts, and plantations. The secondary,
though honorable, place is filled by the maphrian, who, in his station
at Mosul itself, defies the Nestorian catholic with whom he contests the
primacy of the East. Under the patriarch and the maphrian, one hundred
and fifty archbishops and bishops have been counted in the different
ages of the Jacobite church; but the order of the hierarchy is relaxed
or dissolved, and the greater part of their dioceses is confined to the
neighborhood of the Euphrates and the Tigris. The cities of Aleppo and
Amida, which are often visited by the patriarch, contain some wealthy
merchants and industrious mechanics, but the multitude derive their
scanty sustenance from their daily labor: and poverty, as well as
superstition, may impose their excessive fasts: five annual lents,
during which both the clergy and laity abstain not only from flesh
or eggs, but even from the taste of wine, of oil, and of fish. Their
present numbers are esteemed from fifty to fourscore thousand souls, the
remnant of a populous church, which was gradually decreased under the
impression of twelve centuries. Yet in that long period, some strangers
of merit have been converted to the Monophysite faith, and a Jew was
the father of Abulpharagius, [130] primate of the East, so truly eminent
both in his life and death. In his life he was an elegant writer of the
Syriac and Arabic tongues, a poet, physician, and historian, a subtile
philosopher, and a moderate divine. In his death, his funeral was
attended by his rival the Nestorian patriarch, with a train of Greeks
and Armenians, who forgot their disputes, and mingled their tears over
the grave of an enemy. The sect which was honored by the virtues
of Abulpharagius appears, however, to sink below the level of their
Nestorian brethren. The superstition of the Jacobites is more abject,
their fasts more rigid, [131] their intestine divisions are more
numerous, and their doctors (as far as I can measure the degrees of
nonsense) are more remote from the precincts of reason. Something may
possibly be allowed for the rigor of the Monophysite theology; much more
for the superior influence of the monastic order. In Syria, in Egypt,
in Ethiopia, the Jacobite monks have ever been distinguished by the
austerity of their penance and the absurdity of their legends. Alive or
dead, they are worshipped as the favorites of the Deity; the crosier
of bishop and patriarch is reserved for their venerable hands; and they
assume the government of men, while they are yet reeking with the habits
and prejudices of the cloister. [132]

[Footnote 125: Is the expression of Theodore, in his Treatise of
the Incarnation, p. 245, 247, as he is quoted by La Croze, (Hist. du
Christianisme d'Ethiopie et d'Armenie, p. 35,) who exclaims, perhaps
too hastily, "Quel pitoyable raisonnement!" Renaudot has touched (Hist.
Patriarch. Alex. p. 127--138) the Oriental accounts of Severus; and
his authentic creed may be found in the epistle of John the Jacobite
patriarch of Antioch, in the xth century, to his brother Mannas of
Alexandria, (Asseman. Bibliot. Orient. tom. ii. p. 132--141.)]

[Footnote 126: Epist. Archimandritarum et Monachorum Syriae Secundae ad
Papam Hormisdam, Concil. tom. v. p. 598--602. The courage of St. Sabas,
ut leo animosus, will justify the suspicion that the arms of these monks
were not always spiritual or defensive, (Baronius, A.D. 513, No. 7,
&c.)]

[Footnote 127: Assemanni (Bibliot. Orient. tom. ii. p. 10--46) and La
Croze (Christianisme d'Ethiopie, p. 36--40) will supply the history of
Xenaias, or Philoxenus, bishop of Mabug, or Hierapolis, in Syria. He was
a perfect master of the Syriac language, and the author or editor of a
version of the New Testament.]

[Footnote 128: The names and titles of fifty-four bishops who were
exiled by Justin, are preserved in the Chronicle of Dionysius,
(apud Asseman. tom. ii. p. 54.) Severus was personally summoned to
Constantinople--for his trial, says Liberatus (Brev. c. 19)--that his
tongue might be cut out, says Evagrius, (l. iv. c. iv.) The prudent
patriarch did not stay to examine the difference. This ecclesiastical
revolution is fixed by Pagi to the month of September of the year 518,
(Critica, tom. ii. p. 506.)]

[Footnote 129: The obscure history of James or Jacobus Baradaeus, or
Zanzalust may be gathered from Eutychius, (Annal. tom. ii. p. 144, 147,)

Orient. tom. i. p. 424, tom. ii. p. 62-69, 324--332, 414, tom. iii.
p. 385--388.) He seems to be unknown to the Greeks. The Jacobites
themselves had rather deduce their name and pedigree from St. James the
apostle.]

[Footnote 130: The account of his person and writings is perhaps the
most curious article in the Bibliotheca of Assemannus, (tom. ii.
p. 244--321, under the name of Gregorius Bar-Hebroeus.) La Croze
(Christianisme d'Ethiopie, p. 53--63) ridicules the prejudice of the
Spaniards against the Jewish blood which secretly defiles their church
and state.]

[Footnote 131: This excessive abstinence is censured by La Croze, (p.
352,) and even by the Syrian Assemannus, (tom. i. p. 226, tom. ii. p.
304, 305.)]

[Footnote 132: The state of the Monophysites is excellently illustrated
in a dissertation at the beginning of the iid volume of Assemannus,
which contains 142 pages. The Syriac Chronicle of Gregory Bar-Hebraeus,
or Abulpharagius, (Bibliot. Orient. tom. ii. p. 321--463,) pursues
the double series of the Nestorian Catholics and the Maphrians of the
Jacobites.]

III. In the style of the Oriental Christians, the Monothelites of every
age are described under the appellation of Maronites, [133] a name which
has been insensibly transferred from a hermit to a monastery, from a
monastery to a nation. Maron, a saint or savage of the fifth century,
displayed his religious madness in Syria; the rival cities of Apamea and
Emesa disputed his relics, a stately church was erected on his tomb, and
six hundred of his disciples united their solitary cells on the banks
of the Orontes. In the controversies of the incarnation they nicely
threaded the orthodox line between the sects of Nestorians and Eutyches;
but the unfortunate question of one will or operation in the two natures
of Christ, was generated by their curious leisure. Their proselyte, the
emperor Heraclius, was rejected as a Maronite from the walls of
Emesa, he found a refuge in the monastery of his brethren; and their
theological lessons were repaid with the gift a spacious and wealthy
domain. The name and doctrine of this venerable school were propagated
among the Greeks and Syrians, and their zeal is expressed by Macarius,
patriarch of Antioch, who declared before the synod of Constantinople,
that sooner than subscribe the two wills of Christ, he would submit to
be hewn piecemeal and cast into the sea. [134] A similar or a less
cruel mode of persecution soon converted the unresisting subjects of
the plain, while the glorious title of Mardaites, [135] or rebels, was
bravely maintained by the hardy natives of Mount Libanus. John Maron,
one of the most learned and popular of the monks, assumed the character
of patriarch of Antioch; his nephew, Abraham, at the head of the
Maronites, defended their civil and religious freedom against the
tyrants of the East. The son of the orthodox Constantine pursued with
pious hatred a people of soldiers, who might have stood the bulwark of
his empire against the common foes of Christ and of Rome. An army of
Greeks invaded Syria; the monastery of St. Maron was destroyed with
fire; the bravest chieftains were betrayed and murdered, and twelve
thousand of their followers were transplanted to the distant frontiers
of Armenia and Thrace. Yet the humble nation of the Maronites had
survived the empire of Constantinople, and they still enjoy, under
their Turkish masters, a free religion and a mitigated servitude. Their
domestic governors are chosen among the ancient nobility: the patriarch,
in his monastery of Canobin, still fancies himself on the throne of
Antioch: nine bishops compose his synod, and one hundred and fifty
priests, who retain the liberty of marriage, are intrusted with the care
of one hundred thousand souls. Their country extends from the ridge of
Mount Libanus to the shores of Tripoli; and the gradual descent affords,
in a narrow space, each variety of soil and climate, from the Holy
Cedars, erect under the weight of snow, [136] to the vine, the mulberry,
and the olive-trees of the fruitful valley. In the twelfth century, the
Maronites, abjuring the Monothelite error were reconciled to the Latin
churches of Antioch and Rome, [137] and the same alliance has been
frequently renewed by the ambition of the popes and the distress of the
Syrians. But it may reasonably be questioned, whether their union has
ever been perfect or sincere; and the learned Maronites of the college
of Rome have vainly labored to absolve their ancestors from the guilt of
heresy and schism. [138]

[Footnote 133: The synonymous use of the two words may be proved from
Eutychius, (Annal. tom. ii. p. 191, 267, 332,) and many similar passages
which may be found in the methodical table of Pocock. He was not
actuated by any prejudice against the Maronites of the xth century; and
we may believe a Melchite, whose testimony is confirmed by the Jacobites
and Latins.]

[Footnote 134: Concil. tom. vii. p. 780. The Monothelite cause was
supported with firmness and subtilty by Constantine, a Syrian priest of
Apamea, (p. 1040, &c.)]

[Footnote 135: Theophanes (Chron. p. 295, 296, 300, 302, 306) and
Cedrenus (p. 437, 440) relates the exploits of the Mardaites: the name
(Mard, in Syriac, rebellavit) is explained by La Roque, (Voyage de la
Syrie, tom. ii. p. 53;) and dates are fixed by Pagi, (A.D. 676, No.
4--14, A.D. 685, No. 3, 4;) and even the obscure story of the patriarch
John Maron (Asseman. Bibliot. Orient. tom. i. p. 496--520) illustrates
from the year 686 to 707, the troubles of Mount Libanus. * Note: Compare
on the Mardaites Anquetil du Perron, in the fiftieth volume of the Mem.
de l'Acad. des Inscriptions; and Schlosser, Bildersturmendes Kaiser, p.
100.--M]

[Footnote 136: In the last century twenty large cedars still remained,
(Voyage de la Roque, tom. i. p. 68--76;) at present they are reduced
to four or five, (Volney, tom. i. p. 264.) These trees, so famous in
Scripture, were guarded by excommunication: the wood was sparingly
borrowed for small crosses, &c.; an annual mass was chanted under their
shade; and they were endowed by the Syrians with a sensitive power of
erecting their branches to repel the snow, to which Mount Libanus
is less faithful than it is painted by Tacitus: inter ardores opacum
fidumque nivibus--a daring metaphor, (Hist. v. 6.) Note: Of the oldest
and best looking trees, I counted eleven or twelve twenty-five very
large ones; and about fifty of middling size; and more than three
hundred smaller and young ones. Burckhardt's Travels in Syria p. 19.--M]

[Footnote 137: The evidence of William of Tyre (Hist. in Gestis Dei per
Francos, l. xxii. c. 8, p. 1022) is copied or confirmed by Jacques
de Vitra, (Hist. Hierosolym. l. ii. c. 77, p. 1093, 1094.) But this
unnatural league expired with the power of the Franks; and Abulpharagius
(who died in 1286) considers the Maronites as a sect of Monothelites,
(Bibliot. Orient. tom. ii. p. 292.)]

[Footnote 138: I find a description and history of the Maronites in the
Voyage de la Syrie et du Mont Liban par la Roque, (2 vols. in 12mo.,
Amsterdam, 1723; particularly tom. i. p. 42--47, p. 174--184, tom. ii.
p. 10--120.) In the ancient part, he copies the prejudices of Nairon and
the other Maronites of Rome, which Assemannus is afraid to renounce and
ashamed to support. Jablonski, (Institut. Hist. Christ. tom. iii. p.
186.) Niebuhr, (Voyage de l'Arabie, &c., tom. ii. p. 346, 370--381,)
and, above all, the judicious Volney, (Voyage en Egypte et en Syrie,
tom. ii. p. 8--31, Paris, 1787,) may be consulted.]

IV. Since the age of Constantine, the Armenians [139] had signalized
their attachment to the religion and empire of the Christians. [1391]
The disorders of their country, and their ignorance of the Greek tongue,
prevented their clergy from assisting at the synod of Chalcedon, and
they floated eighty-four years [140] in a state of indifference
or suspense, till their vacant faith was finally occupied by the
missionaries of Julian of Halicarnassus, [141] who in Egypt, their
common exile, had been vanquished by the arguments or the influence of
his rival Severus, the Monophysite patriarch of Antioch. The Armenians
alone are the pure disciples of Eutyches, an unfortunate parent, who has
been renounced by the greater part of his spiritual progeny. They alone
persevere in the opinion, that the manhood of Christ was created, or
existed without creation, of a divine and incorruptible substance. Their
adversaries reproach them with the adoration of a phantom; and they
retort the accusation, by deriding or execrating the blasphemy of the
Jacobites, who impute to the Godhead the vile infirmities of the flesh,
even the natural effects of nutrition and digestion. The religion of
Armenia could not derive much glory from the learning or the power of
its inhabitants. The royalty expired with the origin of their schism;
and their Christian kings, who arose and fell in the thirteenth century
on the confines of Cilicia, were the clients of the Latins and the
vassals of the Turkish sultan of Iconium. The helpless nation has seldom
been permitted to enjoy the tranquillity of servitude. From the earliest
period to the present hour, Armenia has been the theatre of perpetual
war: the lands between Tauris and Erivan were dispeopled by the
cruel policy of the Sophis; and myriads of Christian families were
transplanted, to perish or to propagate in the distant provinces of
Persia. Under the rod of oppression, the zeal of the Armenians is
fervent and intrepid; they have often preferred the crown of martyrdom
to the white turban of Mahomet; they devoutly hate the error and
idolatry of the Greeks; and their transient union with the Latins is not
less devoid of truth, than the thousand bishops, whom their patriarch
offered at the feet of the Roman pontiff. [142] The catholic, or
patriarch, of the Armenians resides in the monastery of Ekmiasin, three
leagues from Erivan. Forty-seven archbishops, each of whom may claim the
obedience of four or five suffragans, are consecrated by his hand; but
the far greater part are only titular prelates, who dignify with their
presence and service the simplicity of his court. As soon as they have
performed the liturgy, they cultivate the garden; and our bishops will
hear with surprise, that the austerity of their life increases in just
proportion to the elevation of their rank.

In the fourscore thousand towns or villages of his spiritual empire, the
patriarch receives a small and voluntary tax from each person above the
age of fifteen; but the annual amount of six hundred thousand crowns
is insufficient to supply the incessant demands of charity and tribute.
Since the beginning of the last century, the Armenians have obtained a
large and lucrative share of the commerce of the East: in their return
from Europe, the caravan usually halts in the neighborhood of Erivan,
the altars are enriched with the fruits of their patient industry;
and the faith of Eutyches is preached in their recent congregations of
Barbary and Poland. [143]

[Footnote 139: The religion of the Armenians is briefly described by La
Croze, (Hist. du Christ. de l'Ethiopie et de l'Armenie, p. 269--402.) He
refers to the great Armenian History of Galanus, (3 vols. in fol. Rome,
1650--1661,) and commends the state of Armenia in the iiid volume of the
Nouveaux Memoires des Missions du Levant. The work of a Jesuit must have
sterling merit when it is praised by La Croze.]

[Footnote 1391: See vol. iii. ch. xx. p. 271.--M.]

[Footnote 140: The schism of the Armenians is placed 84 years after the
council of Chalcedon, (Pagi, Critica, ad A.D. 535.) It was consummated
at the end of seventeen years; and it is from the year of Christ 552
that we date the aera of the Armenians, (L'Art de verifier les Dates, p.
xxxv.)]

[Footnote 141: The sentiments and success of Julian of Halicarnassus may
be seen in Liberatus, (Brev. c. 19,) Renaudot, (Hist. Patriarch. Alex.
p. 132, 303,) and Assemannus, (Bibliot. Orient. tom. ii. Dissertat.
Monophysitis, l. viii. p. 286.)]

[Footnote 142: See a remarkable fact of the xiith century in the History
of Nicetas Choniates, (p. 258.) Yet three hundred years before, Photius
(Epistol. ii. p. 49, edit. Montacut.) had gloried in the conversion of
the Armenians.]

[Footnote 143: The travelling Armenians are in the way of every
traveller, and their mother church is on the high road between
Constantinople and Ispahan; for their present state, see Fabricius,
(Lux Evangelii, &c., c. xxxviii. p. 40--51,) Olearius, (l. iv. c. 40,)
Chardin, (vol. ii. p. 232,) Teurnefort, (lettre xx.,) and, above all,
Tavernier, (tom. i. p. 28--37, 510-518,) that rambling jeweller, who had
read nothing, but had seen so much and so well]

V. In the rest of the Roman empire, the despotism of the prince might
eradicate or silence the sectaries of an obnoxious creed. But the
stubborn temper of the Egyptians maintained their opposition to the
synod of Chalcedon, and the policy of Justinian condescended to expect
and to seize the opportunity of discord. The Monophysite church of
Alexandria [144] was torn by the disputes of the corruptibles and
incorruptibles, and on the death of the patriarch, the two factions
upheld their respective candidates. [145] Gaian was the disciple of
Julian, Theodosius had been the pupil of Severus: the claims of the
former were supported by the consent of the monks and senators, the city
and the province; the latter depended on the priority of his ordination,
the favor of the empress Theodora, and the arms of the eunuch Narses,
which might have been used in more honorable warfare. The exile of
the popular candidate to Carthage and Sardinia inflamed the ferment of
Alexandria; and after a schism of one hundred and seventy years, the
Gaianites still revered the memory and doctrine of their founder. The
strength of numbers and of discipline was tried in a desperate and
bloody conflict; the streets were filled with the dead bodies of
citizens and soldiers; the pious women, ascending the roofs of their
houses, showered down every sharp or ponderous utensil on the heads of
the enemy; and the final victory of Narses was owing to the flames, with
which he wasted the third capital of the Roman world. But the lieutenant
of Justinian had not conquered in the cause of a heretic; Theodosius
himself was speedily, though gently, removed; and Paul of Tanis, an
orthodox monk, was raised to the throne of Athanasius. The powers of
government were strained in his support; he might appoint or displace
the dukes and tribunes of Egypt; the allowance of bread, which
Diocletian had granted, was suppressed, the churches were shut, and a
nation of schismatics was deprived at once of their spiritual and carnal
food. In his turn, the tyrant was excommunicated by the zeal and revenge
of the people: and none except his servile Melchites would salute him as
a man, a Christian, or a bishop. Yet such is the blindness of ambition,
that, when Paul was expelled on a charge of murder, he solicited, with
a bribe of seven hundred pounds of gold, his restoration to the same
station of hatred and ignominy. His successor Apollinaris entered
the hostile city in military array, alike qualified for prayer or for
battle. His troops, under arms, were distributed through the streets;
the gates of the cathedral were guarded, and a chosen band was stationed
in the choir, to defend the person of their chief. He stood erect on
his throne, and, throwing aside the upper garment of a warrior, suddenly
appeared before the eyes of the multitude in the robes of patriarch of
Alexandria. Astonishment held them mute; but no sooner had Apollinaris
begun to read the tome of St. Leo, than a volley of curses, and
invectives, and stones, assaulted the odious minister of the emperor
and the synod. A charge was instantly sounded by the successor of the
apostles; the soldiers waded to their knees in blood; and two hundred
thousand Christians are said to have fallen by the sword: an incredible
account, even if it be extended from the slaughter of a day to the
eighteen years of the reign of Apollinaris. Two succeeding patriarchs,
Eulogius [146] and John, [147] labored in the conversion of heretics,
with arms and arguments more worthy of their evangelical profession. The
theological knowledge of Eulogius was displayed in many a volume, which
magnified the errors of Eutyches and Severus, and attempted to reconcile
the ambiguous language of St. Cyril with the orthodox creed of Pope
Leo and the fathers of Chalcedon. The bounteous alms of John the
eleemosynary were dictated by superstition, or benevolence, or policy.
Seven thousand five hundred poor were maintained at his expense; on his
accession he found eight thousand pounds of gold in the treasury of the
church; he collected ten thousand from the liberality of the faithful;
yet the primate could boast in his testament, that he left behind him
no more than the third part of the smallest of the silver coins. The
churches of Alexandria were delivered to the Catholics, the religion of
the Monophysites was proscribed in Egypt, and a law was revived which
excluded the natives from the honors and emoluments of the state.

to Benjamin, is taken from Renaudot, (p. 114--164,) and the second tome

[Footnote 146: Eulogius, who had been a monk of Antioch, was more
conspicuous for subtilty than eloquence. He proves that the enemies of
the faith, the Gaianites and Theodosians, ought not to be reconciled;
that the same proposition may be orthodox in the mouth of St. Cyril,
heretical in that of Severus; that the opposite assertions of St. Leo
are equally true, &c. His writings are no longer extant except in the
Extracts of Photius, who had perused them with care and satisfaction,

Leontius, bishop of Neapolis in Cyrus, whose Greek text, either lost or
hidden, is reflected in the Latin version of Baronius, (A.D. 610, No.9,
