## Chapter XXIV: The Retreat And Death Of Julian.--Part I.

Residence Of Julian At Antioch.--His Successful Expedition Against
The Persians.--Passage Of The Tigris--The Retreat And Death Of
Julian.--Election Of Jovian.--He Saves The Roman Army By A Disgraceful
Treaty. The philosophical fable which Julian composed under the name
of the Caesars, [1] is one of the most agreeable and instructive
productions of ancient wit. [2] During the freedom and equality of the
days of the Saturnalia, Romulus prepared a feast for the deities of
Olympus, who had adopted him as a worthy associate, and for the Roman
princes, who had reigned over his martial people, and the vanquished
nations of the earth. The immortals were placed in just order on their
thrones of state, and the table of the Caesars was spread below the Moon
in the upper region of the air. The tyrants, who would have disgraced
the society of gods and men, were thrown headlong, by the inexorable
Nemesis, into the Tartarean abyss. The rest of the Caesars successively
advanced to their seats; and as they passed, the vices, the defects, the
blemishes of their respective characters, were maliciously noticed
by old Silenus, a laughing moralist, who disguised the wisdom of a
philosopher under the mask of a Bacchanal. [3] As soon as the feast
was ended, the voice of Mercury proclaimed the will of Jupiter, that a
celestial crown should be the reward of superior merit. Julius Caesar,
Augustus, Trajan, and Marcus Antoninus, were selected as the most
illustrious candidates; the effeminate Constantine [4] was not excluded
from this honorable competition, and the great Alexander was invited to
dispute the prize of glory with the Roman heroes. Each of the candidates
was allowed to display the merit of his own exploits; but, in the
judgment of the gods, the modest silence of Marcus pleaded more
powerfully than the elaborate orations of his haughty rivals. When the
judges of this awful contest proceeded to examine the heart, and to
scrutinize the springs of action, the superiority of the Imperial Stoic
appeared still more decisive and conspicuous. [5] Alexander and Caesar,
Augustus, Trajan, and Constantine, acknowledged, with a blush, that
fame, or power, or pleasure had been the important object of their
labors: but the gods themselves beheld, with reverence and love,
a virtuous mortal, who had practised on the throne the lessons of
philosophy; and who, in a state of human imperfection, had aspired to
imitate the moral attributes of the Deity. The value of this agreeable
composition (the Caesars of Julian) is enhanced by the rank of the
author. A prince, who delineates, with freedom, the vices and virtues of
his predecessors, subscribes, in every line, the censure or approbation
of his own conduct.

[Footnote 1: See this fable or satire, p. 306-336 of the Leipsig edition
of Julian's works. The French version of the learned Ezekiel Spanheim
(Paris, 1683) is coarse, languid, and correct; and his notes, proofs,
illustrations, &c., are piled on each other till they form a mass of
557 close-printed quarto pages. The Abbe' de la Bleterie (Vie de Jovien,
tom. i. p. 241-393) has more happily expressed the spirit, as well as
the sense, of the original, which he illustrates with some concise and
curious notes.]

[Footnote 2: Spanheim (in his preface) has most learnedly discussed the
etymology, origin, resemblance, and disagreement of the Greek satyrs,
a dramatic piece, which was acted after the tragedy; and the Latin
satires, (from Satura,) a miscellaneous composition, either in prose or
verse. But the Caesars of Julian are of such an original cast, that the
critic is perplexed to which class he should ascribe them. * Note: See
also Casaubon de Satira, with Rambach's observations.--M.]

[Footnote 3: This mixed character of Silenus is finely painted in the
sixth eclogue of Virgil.]

[Footnote 4: Every impartial reader must perceive and condemn the
partiality of Julian against his uncle Constantine, and the Christian
religion. On this occasion, the interpreters are compelled, by a most
sacred interest, to renounce their allegiance, and to desert the cause
of their author.]

[Footnote 5: Julian was secretly inclined to prefer a Greek to a
Roman. But when he seriously compared a hero with a philosopher, he was
sensible that mankind had much greater obligations to Socrates than to
Alexander, (Orat. ad Themistium, p. 264.)]

In the cool moments of reflection, Julian preferred the useful and
benevolent virtues of Antoninus; but his ambitious spirit was inflamed
by the glory of Alexander; and he solicited, with equal ardor, the
esteem of the wise, and the applause of the multitude. In the season of
life when the powers of the mind and body enjoy the most active vigor,
the emperor who was instructed by the experience, and animated by the
success, of the German war, resolved to signalize his reign by some more
splendid and memorable achievement. The ambassadors of the East, from
the continent of India, and the Isle of Ceylon, [6] had respectfully
saluted the Roman purple. [7] The nations of the West esteemed and
dreaded the personal virtues of Julian, both in peace and war. He
despised the trophies of a Gothic victory, and was satisfied that the
rapacious Barbarians of the Danube would be restrained from any future
violation of the faith of treaties by the terror of his name, and the
additional fortifications with which he strengthened the Thracian and
Illyrian frontiers. The successor of Cyrus and Artaxerxes was the only
rival whom he deemed worthy of his arms; and he resolved, by the final
conquest of Persia, to chastise the naughty nation which had so long
resisted and insulted the majesty of Rome. [9] As soon as the Persian
monarch was informed that the throne of Constantius was filed by a
prince of a very different character, he condescended to make some
artful, or perhaps sincere, overtures towards a negotiation of peace.
But the pride of Sapor was astonished by the firmness of Julian;
who sternly declared, that he would never consent to hold a peaceful
conference among the flames and ruins of the cities of Mesopotamia; and
who added, with a smile of contempt, that it was needless to treat by
ambassadors, as he himself had determined to visit speedily the court
of Persia. The impatience of the emperor urged the diligence of the
military preparations. The generals were named; and Julian, marching
from Constantinople through the provinces of Asia Minor, arrived at
Antioch about eight months after the death of his predecessor. His
ardent desire to march into the heart of Persia, was checked by the
indispensable duty of regulating the state of the empire; by his zeal to
revive the worship of the gods; and by the advice of his wisest friends;
who represented the necessity of allowing the salutary interval of
winter quarters, to restore the exhausted strength of the legions of
Gaul, and the discipline and spirit of the Eastern troops. Julian was
persuaded to fix, till the ensuing spring, his residence at Antioch,
among a people maliciously disposed to deride the haste, and to censure
the delays, of their sovereign. [10]

[Footnote 6: Inde nationibus Indicis certatim cum aonis optimates
mittentibus.... ab usque Divis et Serendivis. Ammian. xx. 7.
This island, to which the names of Taprobana, Serendib, and Ceylon, have
been successively applied, manifests how imperfectly the seas and lands
to the east of Cape Comorin were known to the Romans. 1. Under the reign
of Claudius, a freedman, who farmed the customs of the Red Sea, was
accidentally driven by the winds upon this strange and undiscovered
coast: he conversed six months with the natives; and the king of Ceylon,
who heard, for the first time, of the power and justice of Rome, was
persuaded to send an embassy to the emperor. (Plin. Hist. Nat. vi. 24.)
2. The geographers (and even Ptolemy) have magnified, above fifteen
times, the real size of this new world, which they extended as far as
the equator, and the neighborhood of China. * Note: The name of Diva
gens or Divorum regio, according to the probable conjecture of M.
Letronne, (Trois Mem. Acad. p. 127,) was applied by the ancients to the
whole eastern coast of the Indian Peninsula, from Ceylon to the Canges.
The name may be traced in Devipatnam, Devidan, Devicotta, Divinelly, the
point of Divy.----M. Letronne, p.121, considers the freedman with his
embassy from Ceylon to have been an impostor.--M.]

[Footnote 7: These embassies had been sent to Constantius. Ammianus, who
unwarily deviates into gross flattery, must have forgotten the length of
the way, and the short duration of the reign of Julian.]

[Footnote 8: Gothos saepe fallaces et perfidos; hostes quaerere se
meliores aiebat: illis enim sufficere mercators Galatas per quos ubique
sine conditionis discrimine venumdantur. (Ammian. xxii. 7.) Within less
than fifteen years, these Gothic slaves threatened and subdued their
masters.]

[Footnote 9: Alexander reminds his rival Caesar, who depreciated the
fame and merit of an Asiatic victory, that Crassus and Antony had felt
the Persian arrows; and that the Romans, in a war of three hundred
years, had not yet subdued the single province of Mesopotamia or
Assyria, (Caesares, p. 324.)]

[Footnote 10: The design of the Persian war is declared by Ammianus,
(xxii. 7, 12,) Libanius, (Orat. Parent. c. 79, 80, p. 305, 306,)
Zosimus, (l. iii. p. 158,) and Socrates, (l. iii. c. 19.)]

If Julian had flattered himself, that his personal connection with the
capital of the East would be productive of mutual satisfaction to the
prince and people, he made a very false estimate of his own character,
and of the manners of Antioch. [11] The warmth of the climate disposed
the natives to the most intemperate enjoyment of tranquillity and
opulence; and the lively licentiousness of the Greeks was blended
with the hereditary softness of the Syrians. Fashion was the only law,
pleasure the only pursuit, and the splendor of dress and furniture was
the only distinction of the citizens of Antioch. The arts of luxury were
honored; the serious and manly virtues were the subject of ridicule; and
the contempt for female modesty and reverent age announced the universal
corruption of the capital of the East. The love of spectacles was the
taste, or rather passion, of the Syrians; the most skilful artists were
procured from the adjacent cities; [12] a considerable share of the
revenue was devoted to the public amusements; and the magnificence of
the games of the theatre and circus was considered as the happiness and
as the glory of Antioch. The rustic manners of a prince who disdained
such glory, and was insensible of such happiness, soon disgusted the
delicacy of his subjects; and the effeminate Orientals could neither
imitate, nor admire, the severe simplicity which Julian always
maintained, and sometimes affected. The days of festivity, consecrated,
by ancient custom, to the honor of the gods, were the only occasions in
which Julian relaxed his philosophic severity; and those festivals
were the only days in which the Syrians of Antioch could reject the
allurements of pleasure. The majority of the people supported the glory
of the Christian name, which had been first invented by their ancestors:
[13] they contended themselves with disobeying the moral precepts, but
they were scrupulously attached to the speculative doctrines of their
religion. The church of Antioch was distracted by heresy and schism; but
the Arians and the Athanasians, the followers of Meletius and those of
Paulinus, [14] were actuated by the same pious hatred of their common
adversary.

[Footnote 11: The Satire of Julian, and the Homilies of St. Chrysostom,
exhibit the same picture of Antioch. The miniature which the Abbe de la
Bleterie has copied from thence, (Vie de Julian, p. 332,) is elegant and
correct.]

[Footnote 12: Laodicea furnished charioteers; Tyre and Berytus,
comedians; Caesarea, pantomimes; Heliopolis, singers; Gaza, gladiators,
Ascalon, wrestlers; and Castabala, rope-dancers. See the Expositio
totius Mundi, p. 6, in the third tome of Hudson's Minor Geographers.]

[Footnote 13: The people of Antioch ingenuously professed their
attachment to the Chi, (Christ,) and the Kappa, (Constantius.) Julian in
Misopogon, p. 357.]

[Footnote 14: The schism of Antioch, which lasted eighty-five years,
(A. D. 330-415,) was inflamed, while Julian resided in that city, by the
indiscreet ordination of Paulinus. See Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom. iii.
p. 803 of the quarto edition, (Paris, 1701, &c,) which henceforward I
shall quote.]

The strongest prejudice was entertained against the character of an
apostate, the enemy and successor of a prince who had engaged the
affections of a very numerous sect; and the removal of St. Babylas
excited an implacable opposition to the person of Julian. His subjects
complained, with superstitious indignation, that famine had pursued the
emperor's steps from Constantinople to Antioch; and the discontent of
a hungry people was exasperated by the injudicious attempt to relieve
their distress. The inclemency of the season had affected the harvests
of Syria; and the price of bread, [15] in the markets of Antioch, had
naturally risen in proportion to the scarcity of corn. But the fair
and reasonable proportion was soon violated by the rapacious arts of
monopoly. In this unequal contest, in which the produce of the land is
claimed by one party as his exclusive property, is used by another as a
lucrative object of trade, and is required by a third for the daily and
necessary support of life, all the profits of the intermediate agents
are accumulated on the head of the defenceless customers. The hardships
of their situation were exaggerated and increased by their own
impatience and anxiety; and the apprehension of a scarcity gradually
produced the appearances of a famine. When the luxurious citizens
of Antioch complained of the high price of poultry and fish, Julian
publicly declared, that a frugal city ought to be satisfied with a
regular supply of wine, oil, and bread; but he acknowledged, that it was
the duty of a sovereign to provide for the subsistence of his people.
With this salutary view, the emperor ventured on a very dangerous and
doubtful step, of fixing, by legal authority, the value of corn. He
enacted, that, in a time of scarcity, it should be sold at a price which
had seldom been known in the most plentiful years; and that his own
example might strengthen his laws, he sent into the market four hundred
and twenty-two thousand modii, or measures, which were drawn by his
order from the granaries of Hierapolis, of Chalcis, and even of Egypt.
The consequences might have been foreseen, and were soon felt. The
Imperial wheat was purchased by the rich merchants; the proprietors of
land, or of corn, withheld from the city the accustomed supply; and the
small quantities that appeared in the market were secretly sold at an
advanced and illegal price. Julian still continued to applaud his own
policy, treated the complaints of the people as a vain and ungrateful
murmur, and convinced Antioch that he had inherited the obstinacy,
though not the cruelty, of his brother Gallus. [16] The remonstrances of
the municipal senate served only to exasperate his inflexible mind.
He was persuaded, perhaps with truth, that the senators of Antioch who
possessed lands, or were concerned in trade, had themselves contributed
to the calamities of their country; and he imputed the disrespectful
boldness which they assumed, to the sense, not of public duty, but of
private interest. The whole body, consisting of two hundred of the most
noble and wealthy citizens, were sent, under a guard, from the palace to
the prison; and though they were permitted, before the close of evening,
to return to their respective houses, [17] the emperor himself could
not obtain the forgiveness which he had so easily granted. The same
grievances were still the subject of the same complaints, which were
industriously circulated by the wit and levity of the Syrian Greeks.
During the licentious days of the Saturnalia, the streets of the city
resounded with insolent songs, which derided the laws, the religion,
the personal conduct, and even the beard, of the emperor; the spirit
of Antioch was manifested by the connivance of the magistrates, and the
applause of the multitude. [18] The disciple of Socrates was too deeply
affected by these popular insults; but the monarch, endowed with a quick
sensibility, and possessed of absolute power, refused his passions
the gratification of revenge. A tyrant might have proscribed, without
distinction, the lives and fortunes of the citizens of Antioch; and
the unwarlike Syrians must have patiently submitted to the lust, the
rapaciousness and the cruelty, of the faithful legions of Gaul. A milder
sentence might have deprived the capital of the East of its honors and
privileges; and the courtiers, perhaps the subjects, of Julian, would
have applauded an act of justice, which asserted the dignity of the
supreme magistrate of the republic. [19] But instead of abusing, or
exerting, the authority of the state, to revenge his personal injuries,
Julian contented himself with an inoffensive mode of retaliation, which
it would be in the power of few princes to employ. He had been insulted
by satires and libels; in his turn, he composed, under the title of
the Enemy of the Beard, an ironical confession of his own faults, and a
severe satire on the licentious and effeminate manners of Antioch. This
Imperial reply was publicly exposed before the gates of the palace; and
the Misopogon [20] still remains a singular monument of the resentment,
the wit, the humanity, and the indiscretion of Julian. Though he
affected to laugh, he could not forgive. [21] His contempt was
expressed, and his revenge might be gratified, by the nomination of a
governor [22] worthy only of such subjects; and the emperor, forever
renouncing the ungrateful city, proclaimed his resolution to pass the
ensuing winter at Tarsus in Cilicia. [23]

[Footnote 15: Julian states three different proportions, of five,
ten, or fifteen medii of wheat for one piece of gold, according to the
degrees of plenty and scarcity, (in Misopogon, p. 369.) From this fact,
and from some collateral examples, I conclude, that under the successors
of Constantine, the moderate price of wheat was about thirty-two
shillings the English quarter, which is equal to the average price
of the sixty-four first years of the present century. See Arbuthnot's
Tables of Coins, Weights, and Measures, p. 88, 89. Plin. Hist. Natur.

[Footnote 16: Nunquam a proposito declinabat, Galli similis fratris,
licet incruentus. Ammian. xxii. 14. The ignorance of the most
enlightened princes may claim some excuse; but we cannot be satisfied
with Julian's own defence, (in Misopogon, p. 363, 369,) or the elaborate
apology of Libanius, (Orat. Parental c. xcvii. p. 321.)]

[Footnote 17: Their short and easy confinement is gently touched by
Libanius, (Orat. Parental. c. xcviii. p. 322, 323.)]

[Footnote 18: Libanius, (ad Antiochenos de Imperatoris ira, c. 17, 18,
19, in Fabricius, Bibliot. Graec. tom. vii. p. 221-223,) like a skilful
advocate, severely censures the folly of the people, who suffered for
the crime of a few obscure and drunken wretches.]

[Footnote 19: Libanius (ad Antiochen. c. vii. p. 213) reminds Antioch of
the recent chastisement of Caesarea; and even Julian (in Misopogon, p.
355) insinuates how severely Tarentum had expiated the insult to the
Roman ambassadors.]

[Footnote 20: On the subject of the Misopogon, see Ammianus, (xxii. 14,)
Libanius, (Orat. Parentalis, c. xcix. p. 323,) Gregory Nazianzen, (Orat.
iv. p. 133) and the Chronicle of Antioch, by John Malala, (tom. ii. p.
15, 16.) I have essential obligations to the translation and notes of
the Abbe de la Bleterie, (Vie de Jovien, tom. ii. p. 1-138.)]

[Footnote 21: Ammianus very justly remarks, Coactus dissimulare pro
tempore ira sufflabatur interna. The elaborate irony of Julian at length
bursts forth into serious and direct invective.]

[Footnote 22: Ipse autem Antiochiam egressurus, Heliopoliten quendam
Alexandrum Syriacae jurisdictioni praefecit, turbulentum et
saevum; dicebatque non illum meruisse, sed Antiochensibus avaris et
contumeliosis hujusmodi judicem convenire. Ammian. xxiii. 2. Libanius,
(Epist. 722, p. 346, 347,) who confesses to Julian himself, that he had
shared the general discontent, pretends that Alexander was a useful,
though harsh, reformer of the manners and religion of Antioch.]

[Footnote 23: Julian, in Misopogon, p. 364. Ammian. xxiii. 2, and
Valesius, ad loc. Libanius, in a professed oration, invites him to
return to his loyal and penitent city of Antioch.]

Yet Antioch possessed one citizen, whose genius and virtues might atone,
in the opinion of Julian, for the vice and folly of his country. The
sophist Libanius was born in the capital of the East; he publicly
professed the arts of rhetoric and declamation at Nice, Nicomedia,
Constantinople, Athens, and, during the remainder of his life, at
Antioch. His school was assiduously frequented by the Grecian youth; his
disciples, who sometimes exceeded the number of eighty, celebrated their
incomparable master; and the jealousy of his rivals, who persecuted him
from one city to another, confirmed the favorable opinion which Libanius
ostentatiously displayed of his superior merit. The preceptors of Julian
had extorted a rash but solemn assurance, that he would never attend
the lectures of their adversary: the curiosity of the royal youth
was checked and inflamed: he secretly procured the writings of this
dangerous sophist, and gradually surpassed, in the perfect imitation of
his style, the most laborious of his domestic pupils. [24] When Julian
ascended the throne, he declared his impatience to embrace and reward
the Syrian sophist, who had preserved, in a degenerate age, the
Grecian purity of taste, of manners, and of religion. The emperor's
prepossession was increased and justified by the discreet pride of his
favorite. Instead of pressing, with the foremost of the crowd, into
the palace of Constantinople, Libanius calmly expected his arrival
at Antioch; withdrew from court on the first symptoms of coldness and
indifference; required a formal invitation for each visit; and taught
his sovereign an important lesson, that he might command the obedience
of a subject, but that he must deserve the attachment of a friend.
The sophists of every age, despising, or affecting to despise, the
accidental distinctions of birth and fortune, [25] reserve their esteem
for the superior qualities of the mind, with which they themselves are
so plentifully endowed. Julian might disdain the acclamations of a venal
court, who adored the Imperial purple; but he was deeply flattered by
the praise, the admonition, the freedom, and the envy of an independent
philosopher, who refused his favors, loved his person, celebrated his
fame, and protected his memory. The voluminous writings of Libanius
still exist; for the most part, they are the vain and idle compositions
of an orator, who cultivated the science of words; the productions of
a recluse student, whose mind, regardless of his contemporaries, was
incessantly fixed on the Trojan war and the Athenian commonwealth.
Yet the sophist of Antioch sometimes descended from this imaginary
elevation; he entertained a various and elaborate correspondence; [26]
he praised the virtues of his own times; he boldly arraigned the abuse
of public and private life; and he eloquently pleaded the cause of
Antioch against the just resentment of Julian and Theodosius. It is the
common calamity of old age, [27] to lose whatever might have rendered it
desirable; but Libanius experienced the peculiar misfortune of surviving
the religion and the sciences, to which he had consecrated his genius.
The friend of Julian was an indignant spectator of the triumph of
Christianity; and his bigotry, which darkened the prospect of the
visible world, did not inspire Libanius with any lively hopes of
celestial glory and happiness. [28]

[Footnote 24: Libanius, Orat. Parent. c. vii. p. 230, 231.]

[Footnote 25: Eunapius reports, that Libanius refused the honorary rank
of Praetorian praefect, as less illustrious than the title of Sophist,
(in Vit. Sophist. p. 135.) The critics have observed a similar sentiment
in one of the epistles (xviii. edit. Wolf) of Libanius himself.]

[Footnote 26: Near two thousand of his letters--a mode of composition
in which Libanius was thought to excel--are still extant, and already
published. The critics may praise their subtle and elegant brevity; yet
Dr. Bentley (Dissertation upon Phalaris, p. 48) might justly, though
quaintly observe, that "you feel, by the emptiness and deadness of
them, that you converse with some dreaming pedant, with his elbow on his
desk."]

[Footnote 27: His birth is assigned to the year 314. He mentions the
seventy-sixth year of his age, (A. D. 390,) and seems to allude to some
events of a still later date.]

[Footnote 28: Libanius has composed the vain, prolix, but curious
narrative of his own life, (tom. ii. p. 1-84, edit. Morell,) of which
Eunapius (p. 130-135) has left a concise and unfavorable account. Among
the moderns, Tillemont, (Hist. des Empereurs, tom. iv. p. 571-576,)
Fabricius, (Bibliot. Graec. tom. vii. p. 376-414,) and Lardner, (Heathen
Testimonies, tom. iv. p. 127-163,) have illustrated the character and
writings of this famous sophist.]
