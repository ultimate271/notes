## Chapter XLIV: Idea Of The Roman Jurisprudence.--Part IV.

When Justinian ascended the throne, the reformation of the Roman
jurisprudence was an arduous but indispensable task. In the space of ten
centuries, the infinite variety of laws and legal opinions had filled
many thousand volumes, which no fortune could purchase and no capacity
could digest. Books could not easily be found; and the judges, poor in
the midst of riches, were reduced to the exercise of their illiterate
discretion. The subjects of the Greek provinces were ignorant of the
language that disposed of their lives and properties; and the barbarous
dialect of the Latins was imperfectly studied in the academies of
Berytus and Constantinople. As an Illyrian soldier, that idiom was
familiar to the infancy of Justinian; his youth had been instructed by
the lessons of jurisprudence, and his Imperial choice selected the most
learned civilians of the East, to labor with their sovereign in the
work of reformation. [71] The theory of professors was assisted by the
practice of advocates, and the experience of magistrates; and the
whole undertaking was animated by the spirit of Tribonian. [72] This
extraordinary man, the object of so much praise and censure, was
a native of Side in Pamphylia; and his genius, like that of Bacon,
embraced, as his own, all the business and knowledge of the age.
Tribonian composed, both in prose and verse, on a strange diversity of
curious and abstruse subjects: [73] a double panegyric of Justinian and
the life of the philosopher Theodotus; the nature of happiness and the
duties of government; Homer's catalogue and the four-and-twenty sorts of
metre; the astronomical canon of Ptolemy; the changes of the months;
the houses of the planets; and the harmonic system of the world. To the
literature of Greece he added the use of the Latin tonque; the Roman
civilians were deposited in his library and in his mind; and he most
assiduously cultivated those arts which opened the road of wealth and
preferment. From the bar of the Praetorian praefects, he raised himself
to the honors of quaestor, of consul, and of master of the offices: the
council of Justinian listened to his eloquence and wisdom; and envy
was mitigated by the gentleness and affability of his manners. The
reproaches of impiety and avarice have stained the virtue or the
reputation of Tribonian. In a bigoted and persecuting court, the
principal minister was accused of a secret aversion to the Christian
faith, and was supposed to entertain the sentiments of an Atheist and
a Pagan, which have been imputed, inconsistently enough, to the last
philosophers of Greece. His avarice was more clearly proved and more
sensibly felt. If he were swayed by gifts in the administration of
justice, the example of Bacon will again occur; nor can the merit of
Tribonian atone for his baseness, if he degraded the sanctity of his
profession; and if laws were every day enacted, modified, or repealed,
for the base consideration of his private emolument. In the sedition of
Constantinople, his removal was granted to the clamors, perhaps to the
just indignation, of the people: but the quaestor was speedily restored,
and, till the hour of his death, he possessed, above twenty years, the
favor and confidence of the emperor. His passive and dutiful submission
had been honored with the praise of Justinian himself, whose vanity was
incapable of discerning how often that submission degenerated into the
grossest adulation. Tribonian adored the virtues of his gracious of
his gracious master; the earth was unworthy of such a prince; and he
affected a pious fear, that Justinian, like Elijah or Romulus, would be
snatched into the air, and translated alive to the mansions of celestial
glory. [74]

[Footnote 71: For the legal labors of Justinian, I have studied the
Preface to the Institutes; the 1st, 2d, and 3d Prefaces to the Pandects;
the 1st and 2d Preface to the Code; and the Code itself, (l. i. tit.
xvii. de Veteri Jure enucleando.) After these original testimonies,
I have consulted, among the moderns, Heineccius, (Hist. J. R. No.
383--404,) Terasson. (Hist. de la Jurisprudence Romaine, p. 295--356,)
Gravina, (Opp. p. 93-100,) and Ludewig, in his Life of Justinian,
(p.19--123, 318-321; for the Code and Novels, p. 209--261; for the
Digest or Pandects, p. 262--317.)]

[Footnote 72: For the character of Tribonian, see the testimonies of
Procopius, (Persic. l. i. c. 23, 24. Anecdot. c. 13, 20,) and Suidas,
(tom. iii. p. 501, edit. Kuster.) Ludewig (in Vit. Justinian, p.
175--209) works hard, very hard, to whitewash--the blackamoor.]

[Footnote 73: I apply the two passages of Suidas to the same man; every
circumstance so exactly tallies. Yet the lawyers appear ignorant; and
Fabricius is inclined to separate the two characters, (Bibliot. Grae.
tom. i. p. 341, ii. p. 518, iii. p. 418, xii. p. 346, 353, 474.)]

[Footnote 74: This story is related by Hesychius, (de Viris
Illustribus,) Procopius, (Anecdot. c. 13,) and Suidas, (tom. iii. p.
501.) Such flattery is incredible! --Nihil est quod credere de se Non
possit, cum laudatur Diis aequa potestas. Fontenelle (tom. i. p.
32--39) has ridiculed the impudence of the modest Virgil. But the same
Fontenelle places his king above the divine Augustus; and the sage
Boileau has not blushed to say, "Le destin a ses yeux n'oseroit
balancer" Yet neither Augustus nor Louis XIV. were fools.]

If Caesar had achieved the reformation of the Roman law, his creative
genius, enlightened by reflection and study, would have given to the
world a pure and original system of jurisprudence. Whatever flattery
might suggest, the emperor of the East was afraid to establish his
private judgment as the standard of equity: in the possession of
legislative power, he borrowed the aid of time and opinion; and his
laborious compilations are guarded by the sages and legislature of past
times. Instead of a statue cast in a simple mould by the hand of an
artist, the works of Justinian represent a tessellated pavement of
antique and costly, but too often of incoherent, fragments. In the first
year of his reign, he directed the faithful Tribonian, and nine learned
associates, to revise the ordinances of his predecessors, as they were
contained, since the time of Adrian, in the Gregorian Hermogenian, and
Theodosian codes; to purge the errors and contradictions, to retrench
whatever was obsolete or superfluous, and to select the wise and
salutary laws best adapted to the practice of the tribunals and the use
of his subjects. The work was accomplished in fourteen months; and
the twelve books or tables, which the new decemvirs produced, might be
designed to imitate the labors of their Roman predecessors. The new
Code of Justinian was honored with his name, and confirmed by his royal
signature: authentic transcripts were multiplied by the pens of notaries
and scribes; they were transmitted to the magistrates of the European,
the Asiatic, and afterwards the African provinces; and the law of the
empire was proclaimed on solemn festivals at the doors of churches.
A more arduous operation was still behind--to extract the spirit of
jurisprudence from the decisions and conjectures, the questions and
disputes, of the Roman civilians. Seventeen lawyers, with Tribonian
at their head, were appointed by the emperor to exercise an absolute
jurisdiction over the works of their predecessors. If they had obeyed
his commands in ten years, Justinian would have been satisfied with
their diligence; and the rapid composition of the Digest of Pandects,
[75] in three years, will deserve praise or censure, according to the
merit of the execution. From the library of Tribonian, they chose forty,
the most eminent civilians of former times: [76] two thousand treatises
were comprised in an abridgment of fifty books; and it has been
carefully recorded, that three millions of lines or sentences, [77] were
reduced, in this abstract, to the moderate number of one hundred and
fifty thousand. The edition of this great work was delayed a month
after that of the Institutes; and it seemed reasonable that the elements
should precede the digest of the Roman law. As soon as the emperor
had approved their labors, he ratified, by his legislative power, the
speculations of these private citizens: their commentaries, on the
twelve tables, the perpetual edict, the laws of the people, and the
decrees of the senate, succeeded to the authority of the text; and the
text was abandoned, as a useless, though venerable, relic of antiquity.
The Code, the Pandects, and the Institutes, were declared to be the
legitimate system of civil jurisprudence; they alone were admitted into
the tribunals, and they alone were taught in the academies of Rome,
Constantinople, and Berytus. Justinian addressed to the senate and
provinces his eternal oracles; and his pride, under the mask of piety,
ascribed the consummation of this great design to the support and
inspiration of the Deity.

[Footnote 75: General receivers was a common title of the Greek
miscellanies, (Plin. Praefat. ad Hist. Natur.) The Digesta of Scaevola,
Marcellinus, Celsus, were already familiar to the civilians: but
Justinian was in the wrong when he used the two appellations as
synonymous. Is the word Pandects Greek or Latin--masculine or feminine?
The diligent Brenckman will not presume to decide these momentous
controversies, (Hist. Pandect. Florentine. p. 200--304.) Note: The word
was formerly in common use. See the preface is Aulus Gellius--W]

[Footnote 76: Angelus Politianus (l. v. Epist. ult.) reckons
thirty-seven (p. 192--200) civilians quoted in the Pandects--a learned,
and for his times, an extraordinary list. The Greek index to the
Pandects enumerates thirty-nine, and forty are produced by the
indefatigable Fabricius, (Bibliot. Graec. tom. iii. p. 488--502.)
Antoninus Augustus (de Nominibus Propriis Pandect. apud Ludewig, p.
283) is said to have added fifty-four names; but they must be vague or
second-hand references.]

[Footnote 77: The item of the ancient Mss. may be strictly defined as
sentences or periods of a complete sense, which, on the breadth of the
parchment rolls or volumes, composed as many lines of unequal length.
The number in each book served as a check on the errors of the scribes,
(Ludewig, p. 211--215; and his original author Suicer. Thesaur.
Ecclesiast. tom. i. p 1021-1036).]

Since the emperor declined the fame and envy of original composition, we
can only require, at his hands, method choice, and fidelity, the
humble, though indispensable, virtues of a compiler. Among the various
combinations of ideas, it is difficult to assign any reasonable
preference; but as the order of Justinian is different in his three
works, it is possible that all may be wrong; and it is certain that
two cannot be right. In the selection of ancient laws, he seems to have
viewed his predecessors without jealousy, and with equal regard: the
series could not ascend above the reign of Adrian, and the narrow
distinction of Paganism and Christianity, introduced by the superstition
of Theodosius, had been abolished by the consent of mankind. But the
jurisprudence of the Pandects is circumscribed within a period of
a hundred years, from the perpetual edict to the death of Severus
Alexander: the civilians who lived under the first Caesars are seldom
permitted to speak, and only three names can be attributed to the age of
the republic. The favorite of Justinian (it has been fiercely urged) was
fearful of encountering the light of freedom and the gravity of Roman
sages.

Tribonian condemned to oblivion the genuine and native wisdom of Cato,
the Scaevolas, and Sulpicius; while he invoked spirits more congenial to
his own, the Syrians, Greeks, and Africans, who flocked to the Imperial
court to study Latin as a foreign tongue, and jurisprudence as a
lucrative profession. But the ministers of Justinian, [78] were
instructed to labor, not for the curiosity of antiquarians, but for
the immediate benefit of his subjects. It was their duty to select the
useful and practical parts of the Roman law; and the writings of the old
republicans, however curious on excellent, were no longer suited to
the new system of manners, religion, and government. Perhaps, if the
preceptors and friends of Cicero were still alive, our candor would
acknowledge, that, except in purity of language, [79] their intrinsic
merit was excelled by the school of Papinian and Ulpian. The science of
the laws is the slow growth of time and experience, and the advantage
both of method and materials, is naturally assumed by the most recent
authors. The civilians of the reign of the Antonines had studied the
works of their predecessors: their philosophic spirit had mitigated the
rigor of antiquity, simplified the forms of proceeding, and emerged
from the jealousy and prejudice of the rival sects. The choice of
the authorities that compose the Pandects depended on the judgment of
Tribonian: but the power of his sovereign could not absolve him from
the sacred obligations of truth and fidelity. As the legislator of the
empire, Justinian might repeal the acts of the Antonines, or condemn, as
seditious, the free principles, which were maintained by the last of the
Roman lawyers. [80] But the existence of past facts is placed beyond
the reach of despotism; and the emperor was guilty of fraud and forgery,
when he corrupted the integrity of their text, inscribed with their
venerable names the words and ideas of his servile reign, [81] and
suppressed, by the hand of power, the pure and authentic copies of
their sentiments. The changes and interpolations of Tribonian and his
colleagues are excused by the pretence of uniformity: but their cares
have been insufficient, and the antinomies, or contradictions of the
Code and Pandects, still exercise the patience and subtilty of modern
civilians. [82]

[Footnote 78: An ingenious and learned oration of Schultingius
(Jurisprudentia Ante-Justinianea, p. 883--907) justifies the choice of
Tribonian, against the passionate charges of Francis Hottoman and his
sectaries.]

[Footnote 79: Strip away the crust of Tribonian, and allow for the use
of technical words, and the Latin of the Pandects will be found
not unworthy of the silver age. It has been vehemently attacked by
Laurentius Valla, a fastidious grammarian of the xvth century, and by
his apologist Floridus Sabinus. It has been defended by Alciat, and
a name less advocate, (most probably James Capellus.) Their various
treatises are collected by Duker, (Opuscula de Latinitate veterum
Jurisconsultorum, Lugd. Bat. 1721, in 12mo.) Note: Gibbon is mistaken
with regard to Valla, who, though he inveighs against the barbarous
style of the civilians of his own day, lavishes the highest praise on
the admirable purity of the language of the ancient writers on civil
law. (M. Warnkonig quotes a long passage of Valla in justification of
this observation.) Since his time, this truth has been recognized by
men of the highest eminence, such as Erasmus, David Hume and
Runkhenius.--W.]

[Footnote 80: Nomina quidem veteribus servavimus, legum autem veritatem
nostram fecimus. Itaque siquid erat in illis seditiosum, multa autem
talia erant ibi reposita, hoc decisum est et definitum, et in perspicuum
finem deducta est quaeque lex, (Cod. Justinian. l. i. tit. xvii. leg.
3, No 10.) A frank confession! * Note: Seditiosum, in the language of
Justinian, means not seditious, but discounted.--W.]

[Footnote 81: The number of these emblemata (a polite name for
forgeries) is much reduced by Bynkershoek, (in the four last books of
his Observations,) who poorly maintains the right of Justinian and the
duty of Tribonian.]

[Footnote 82: The antinomies, or opposite laws of the Code and
Pandects, are sometimes the cause, and often the excuse, of the glorious
uncertainty of the civil law, which so often affords what Montaigne
calls "Questions pour l'Ami." See a fine passage of Franciscus Balduinus
in Justinian, (l. ii. p. 259, &c., apud Ludewig, p. 305, 306.)]

A rumor devoid of evidence has been propagated by the enemies of
Justinian; that the jurisprudence of ancient Rome was reduced to ashes
by the author of the Pandects, from the vain persuasion, that it was now
either false or superfluous. Without usurping an office so
invidious, the emperor might safely commit to ignorance and time the
accomplishments of this destructive wish. Before the invention of
printing and paper, the labor and the materials of writing could be
purchased only by the rich; and it may reasonably be computed, that the
price of books was a hundred fold their present value. [83] Copies were
slowly multiplied and cautiously renewed: the hopes of profit tempted
the sacrilegious scribes to erase the characters of antiquity, [8311]
and Sophocles or Tacitus were obliged to resign the parchment to
missals, homilies, and the golden legend. [84] If such was the fate
of the most beautiful compositions of genius, what stability could be
expected for the dull and barren works of an obsolete science? The books
of jurisprudence were interesting to few, and entertaining to none:
their value was connected with present use, and they sunk forever as
soon as that use was superseded by the innovations of fashion, superior
merit, or public authority. In the age of peace and learning, between
Cicero and the last of the Antonines, many losses had been already
sustained, and some luminaries of the school, or forum, were known only
to the curious by tradition and report. Three hundred and sixty years
of disorder and decay accelerated the progress of oblivion; and it may
fairly be presumed, that of the writings, which Justinian is accused
of neglecting, many were no longer to be found in the libraries of the
East. [85] The copies of Papinian, or Ulpian, which the reformer had
proscribed, were deemed unworthy of future notice: the Twelve Tables and
praetorian edicts insensibly vanished, and the monuments of ancient Rome
were neglected or destroyed by the envy and ignorance of the Greeks.
Even the Pandects themselves have escaped with difficulty and danger
from the common shipwreck, and criticism has pronounced that all the
editions and manuscripts of the West are derived from one original. [86]
It was transcribed at Constantinople in the beginning of the seventh
century, [87] was successively transported by the accidents of war
and commerce to Amalphi, [88] Pisa, [89] and Florence, [90] and is now
deposited as a sacred relic [91] in the ancient palace of the republic.
[92]

[Footnote 83: When Faust, or Faustus, sold at Paris his first printed
Bibles as manuscripts, the price of a parchment copy was reduced from
four or five hundred to sixty, fifty, and forty crowns. The public
was at first pleased with the cheapness, and at length provoked by the
discovery of the fraud, (Mattaire, Annal. Typograph. tom. i. p. 12;
first edit.)]

[Footnote 8311: Among the works which have been recovered, by the
persevering and successful endeavors of M. Mai and his followers to
trace the imperfectly erased characters of the ancient writers on these
Palimpsests, Gibbon at this period of his labors would have hailed with
delight the recovery of the Institutes of Gaius, and the fragments of
the Theodosian Code, published by M Keyron of Turin.--M.]

[Footnote 84: This execrable practice prevailed from the viiith, and
more especially from the xiith, century, when it became almost universal
(Montfaucon, in the Memoires de l'Academie, tom. vi. p. 606, &c.
Bibliotheque Raisonnee de la Diplomatique, tom. i. p. 176.)]

[Footnote 85: Pomponius (Pandect. l. i. tit. ii. leg. 2) observes, that
of the three founders of the civil law, Mucius, Brutus, and Manilius,
extant volumina, scripta Manilii monumenta; that of some old republican
lawyers, haec versantur eorum scripta inter manus hominum. Eight of the
Augustan sages were reduced to a compendium: of Cascellius, scripta non
extant sed unus liber, &c.; of Trebatius, minus frequentatur; of Tubero,
libri parum grati sunt. Many quotations in the Pandects are derived from
books which Tribonian never saw; and in the long period from the viith
to the xiiith century of Rome, the apparent reading of the moderns
successively depends on the knowledge and veracity of their
predecessors.]

[Footnote 86: All, in several instances, repeat the errors of the scribe
and the transpositions of some leaves in the Florentine Pandects. This
fact, if it be true, is decisive. Yet the Pandects are quoted by Ivo of
Chartres, (who died in 1117,) by Theobald, archbishop of Canterbury, and
by Vacarius, our first professor, in the year 1140, (Selden ad Fletam,
c. 7, tom. ii. p. 1080--1085.) Have our British Mss. of the Pandects
been collated?]

[Footnote 87: See the description of this original in Brenckman, (Hist.
Pandect. Florent. l. i. c. 2, 3, p. 4--17, and l. ii.) Politian, an
enthusiast, revered it as the authentic standard of Justinian himself,
(p. 407, 408;) but this paradox is refuted by the abbreviations of the
Florentine Ms. (l. ii. c. 3, p. 117-130.) It is composed of two
quarto volumes, with large margins, on a thin parchment, and the Latin
characters betray the band of a Greek scribe.]

[Footnote 88: Brenckman, at the end of his history, has inserted two
dissertations on the republic of Amalphi, and the Pisan war in the year
1135, &c.]

[Footnote 89: The discovery of the Pandects at Amalphi (A. D 1137) is
first noticed (in 1501) by Ludovicus Bologninus, (Brenckman, l. i.
c. 11, p. 73, 74, l. iv. c. 2, p. 417--425,) on the faith of a Pisan
chronicle, (p. 409, 410,) without a name or a date. The whole story,
though unknown to the xiith century, embellished by ignorant ages,
and suspected by rigid criticism, is not, however, destitute of much
internal probability, (l. i. c. 4--8, p. 17--50.) The Liber Pandectarum
of Pisa was undoubtedly consulted in the xivth century by the great
Bartolus, (p. 406, 407. See l. i. c. 9, p. 50--62.) Note: Savigny (vol.
iii. p. 83, 89) examines and rejects the whole story. See likewise
Hallam vol. iii. p. 514.--M.]

[Footnote 90: Pisa was taken by the Florentines in the year 1406; and
in 1411 the Pandects were transported to the capital. These events are
authentic and famous.]

[Footnote 91: They were new bound in purple, deposited in a rich casket,
and shown to curious travellers by the monks and magistrates bareheaded,
and with lighted tapers, (Brenckman, l. i. c. 10, 11, 12, p. 62--93.)]

[Footnote 92: After the collations of Politian, Bologninus, and
Antoninus Augustinus, and the splendid edition of the Pandects
by Taurellus, (in 1551,) Henry Brenckman, a Dutchman, undertook a
pilgrimage to Florence, where he employed several years in the study of
a single manuscript. His Historia Pandectarum Florentinorum, (Utrecht,
1722, in 4to.,) though a monument of industry, is a small portion of his
original design.]

It is the first care of a reformer to prevent any future reformation. To
maintain the text of the Pandects, the Institutes, and the Code, the use
of ciphers and abbreviations was rigorously proscribed; and as Justinian
recollected, that the perpetual edict had been buried under the weight
of commentators, he denounced the punishment of forgery against the rash
civilians who should presume to interpret or pervert the will of their
sovereign. The scholars of Accursius, of Bartolus, of Cujacius, should
blush for their accumulated guilt, unless they dare to dispute his right
of binding the authority of his successors, and the native freedom of
the mind. But the emperor was unable to fix his own inconstancy; and,
while he boasted of renewing the exchange of Diomede, of transmuting
brass into gold, [93] discovered the necessity of purifying his gold
from the mixture of baser alloy. Six years had not elapsed from the
publication of the Code, before he condemned the imperfect attempt, by
a new and more accurate edition of the same work; which he enriched with
two hundred of his own laws, and fifty decisions of the darkest and
most intricate points of jurisprudence. Every year, or, according
to Procopius, each day, of his long reign, was marked by some legal
innovation. Many of his acts were rescinded by himself; many were
rejected by his successors; many have been obliterated by time; but the
number of sixteen Edicts, and one hundred and sixty-eight Novels, [94]
has been admitted into the authentic body of the civil jurisprudence.
In the opinion of a philosopher superior to the prejudices of
his profession, these incessant, and, for the most part, trifling
alterations, can be only explained by the venal spirit of a prince, who
sold without shame his judgments and his laws. [95] The charge of the
secret historian is indeed explicit and vehement; but the sole instance,
which he produces, may be ascribed to the devotion as well as to the
avarice of Justinian. A wealthy bigot had bequeathed his inheritance to
the church of Emesa; and its value was enhanced by the dexterity of an
artist, who subscribed confessions of debt and promises of payment
with the names of the richest Syrians. They pleaded the established
prescription of thirty or forty years; but their defence was overruled
by a retrospective edict, which extended the claims of the church to
the term of a century; an edict so pregnant with injustice and disorder,
that, after serving this occasional purpose, it was prudently abolished
in the same reign. [96] If candor will acquit the emperor himself, and
transfer the corruption to his wife and favorites, the suspicion of
so foul a vice must still degrade the majesty of his laws; and the
advocates of Justinian may acknowledge, that such levity, whatsoever be
the motive, is unworthy of a legislator and a man.

[Footnote 93: Apud Homerum patrem omnis virtutis, (1st Praefat. ad
Pandect.) A line of Milton or Tasso would surprise us in an act of
parliament. Quae omnia obtinere sancimus in omne aevum. Of the first
Code, he says, (2d Praefat.,) in aeternum valiturum. Man and forever!]

[Footnote 94: Novellae is a classic adjective, but a barbarous
substantive, (Ludewig, p. 245.) Justinian never collected them himself;
the nine collations, the legal standard of modern tribunals, consist of
ninety-eight Novels; but the number was increased by the diligence of
Julian, Haloander, and Contius, (Ludewig, p. 249, 258 Aleman. Not in
Anecdot. p. 98.)]

Decadence des Romains, c. 20, tom. iii. p. 501, in 4to. On this occasion

to the church of Rome, (Novel. ix.) For the general repeal of these
mischievous indulgences, see Novel. cxi. and Edict. v.]

Monarchs seldom condescend to become the preceptors of their subjects;
and some praise is due to Justinian, by whose command an ample system
was reduced to a short and elementary treatise. Among the various
institutes of the Roman law, [97] those of Caius [98] were the most
popular in the East and West; and their use may be considered as an
evidence of their merit. They were selected by the Imperial delegates,
Tribonian, Theophilus, and Dorotheus; and the freedom and purity of the
Antonines was incrusted with the coarser materials of a degenerate age.
The same volume which introduced the youth of Rome, Constantinople,
and Berytus, to the gradual study of the Code and Pandects, is still
precious to the historian, the philosopher, and the magistrate. The
Institutes of Justinian are divided into four books: they proceed,
with no contemptible method, from, I. Persons, to, II. Things, and from
things, to, III. Actions; and the article IV., of Private Wrongs, is
terminated by the principles of Criminal Law. [9811]

[Footnote 97: Lactantius, in his Institutes of Christianity, an elegant
and specious work, proposes to imitate the title and method of the
civilians. Quidam prudentes et arbitri aequitatis Institutiones Civilis
Juris compositas ediderunt, (Institut. Divin. l. i. c. 1.) Such as
Ulpian, Paul, Florentinus, Marcian.]

[Footnote 98: The emperor Justinian calls him suum, though he died
before the end of the second century. His Institutes are quoted by
Servius, Boethius, Priscian, &c.; and the Epitome by Arrian is still
extant. (See the Prolegomena and notes to the edition of Schulting, in
the Jurisprudentia Ante-Justinianea, Lugd. Bat. 1717. Heineccius, Hist.
J R No. 313. Ludewig, in Vit. Just. p. 199.)]

[Footnote 9811: Gibbon, dividing the Institutes into four parts,
considers the appendix of the criminal law in the last title as a fourth
part.--W.]
