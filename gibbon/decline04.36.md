## Chapter XLVI: Troubles In Persia.--Part IV.

Amidst the glories of the succeeding campaign, Heraclius is almost lost
to our eyes, and to those of the Byzantine historians. [91] From the
spacious and fruitful plains of Albania, the emperor appears to follow
the chain of Hyrcanian Mountains, to descend into the province of Media
or Irak, and to carry his victorious arms as far as the royal cities
of Casbin and Ispahan, which had never been approached by a Roman
conqueror. Alarmed by the danger of his kingdom, the powers of Chosroes
were already recalled from the Nile and the Bosphorus, and three
formidable armies surrounded, in a distant and hostile land, the camp
of the emperor. The Colchian allies prepared to desert his standard; and
the fears of the bravest veterans were expressed, rather than concealed,
by their desponding silence. "Be not terrified," said the intrepid
Heraclius, "by the multitude of your foes. With the aid of Heaven, one
Roman may triumph over a thousand Barbarians. But if we devote our
lives for the salvation of our brethren, we shall obtain the crown of
martyrdom, and our immortal reward will be liberally paid by God and
posterity." These magnanimous sentiments were supported by the vigor of
his actions. He repelled the threefold attack of the Persians, improved
the divisions of their chiefs, and, by a well-concerted train of
marches, retreats, and successful actions, finally chased them from the
field into the fortified cities of Media and Assyria. In the severity
of the winter season, Sarbaraza deemed himself secure in the walls of
Salban: he was surprised by the activity of Heraclius, who divided his
troops, and performed a laborious march in the silence of the night. The
flat roofs of the houses were defended with useless valor against the
darts and torches of the Romans: the satraps and nobles of Persia, with
their wives and children, and the flower of their martial youth, were
either slain or made prisoners. The general escaped by a precipitate
flight, but his golden armor was the prize of the conqueror; and the
soldiers of Heraclius enjoyed the wealth and repose which they had so
nobly deserved. On the return of spring, the emperor traversed in seven
days the mountains of Curdistan, and passed without resistance the
rapid stream of the Tigris. Oppressed by the weight of their spoils and
captives, the Roman army halted under the walls of Amida; and Heraclius
informed the senate of Constantinople of his safety and success, which
they had already felt by the retreat of the besiegers. The bridges of
the Euphrates were destroyed by the Persians; but as soon as the emperor
had discovered a ford, they hastily retired to defend the banks of the
Sarus, [92] in Cilicia. That river, an impetuous torrent, was about
three hundred feet broad; the bridge was fortified with strong turrets;
and the banks were lined with Barbarian archers. After a bloody
conflict, which continued till the evening, the Romans prevailed in the
assault; and a Persian of gigantic size was slain and thrown into the
Sarus by the hand of the emperor himself. The enemies were dispersed and
dismayed; Heraclius pursued his march to Sebaste in Cappadocia; and at
the expiration of three years, the same coast of the Euxine applauded
his return from a long and victorious expedition. [93]

[Footnote 91: I cannot find, and (what is much more,) M. D'Anville does
not attempt to seek, the Salban, Tarantum, territory of the Huns, &c.,
mentioned by Theophanes, (p. 260-262.) Eutychius, (Annal. tom. ii. p.
231, 232,) an insufficient author, names Asphahan; and Casbin is most
probably the city of Sapor. Ispahan is twenty-four days' journey from
Tauris, and Casbin half way between, them (Voyages de Tavernier, tom. i.
p. 63--82.)]

[Footnote 92: At ten parasangs from Tarsus, the army of the younger
Cyrus passed the Sarus, three plethra in breadth: the Pyramus, a stadium
in breadth, ran five parasangs farther to the east, (Xenophon, Anabas.

[Footnote 93: George of Pisidia (Bell. Abaricum, 246--265, p. 49)
celebrates with truth the persevering courage of the three campaigns
against the Persians.]

Instead of skirmishing on the frontier, the two monarchs who disputed
the empire of the East aimed their desperate strokes at the heart of
their rival. The military force of Persia was wasted by the marches and
combats of twenty years, and many of the veterans, who had survived
the perils of the sword and the climate, were still detained in the
fortresses of Egypt and Syria. But the revenge and ambition of Chosroes
exhausted his kingdom; and the new levies of subjects, strangers, and
slaves, were divided into three formidable bodies. [94] The first army
of fifty thousand men, illustrious by the ornament and title of the
golden spears, was destined to march against Heraclius; the second
was stationed to prevent his junction with the troops of his brother
Theodorus; and the third was commanded to besiege Constantinople, and
to second the operations of the chagan, with whom the Persian king had
ratified a treaty of alliance and partition. Sarbar, the general of the
third army, penetrated through the provinces of Asia to the well-known
camp of Chalcedon, and amused himself with the destruction of the sacred
and profane buildings of the Asiatic suburbs, while he impatiently
waited the arrival of his Scythian friends on the opposite side of the
Bosphorus. On the twenty-ninth of June, thirty thousand Barbarians, the
vanguard of the Avars, forced the long wall, and drove into the capital
a promiscuous crowd of peasants, citizens, and soldiers. Fourscore
thousand [95] of his native subjects, and of the vassal tribes of
Gepidae, Russians, Bulgarians, and Sclavonians, advanced under the
standard of the chagan; a month was spent in marches and negotiations,
but the whole city was invested on the thirty-first of July, from the
suburbs of Pera and Galata to the Blachernae and seven towers; and the
inhabitants descried with terror the flaming signals of the European
and Asiatic shores. In the mean while, the magistrates of Constantinople
repeatedly strove to purchase the retreat of the chagan; but their
deputies were rejected and insulted; and he suffered the patricians to
stand before his throne, while the Persian envoys, in silk robes, were
seated by his side. "You see," said the haughty Barbarian, "the proofs
of my perfect union with the great king; and his lieutenant is ready to
send into my camp a select band of three thousand warriors. Presume no
longer to tempt your master with a partial and inadequate ransom your
wealth and your city are the only presents worthy of my acceptance. For
yourselves, I shall permit you to depart, each with an under-garment and
a shirt; and, at my entreaty, my friend Sarbar will not refuse a passage
through his lines. Your absent prince, even now a captive or a fugitive,
has left Constantinople to its fate; nor can you escape the arms of
the Avars and Persians, unless you could soar into the air like birds,
unless like fishes you could dive into the waves." [96] During ten
successive days, the capital was assaulted by the Avars, who had made
some progress in the science of attack; they advanced to sap or batter
the wall, under the cover of the impenetrable tortoise; their engines
discharged a perpetual volley of stones and darts; and twelve lofty
towers of wood exalted the combatants to the height of the neighboring
ramparts.

But the senate and people were animated by the spirit of Heraclius, who
had detached to their relief a body of twelve thousand cuirassiers; the
powers of fire and mechanics were used with superior art and success in
the defence of Constantinople; and the galleys, with two and three ranks
of oars, commanded the Bosphorus, and rendered the Persians the idle
spectators of the defeat of their allies. The Avars were repulsed; a
fleet of Sclavonian canoes was destroyed in the harbor; the vassals
of the chagan threatened to desert, his provisions were exhausted, and
after burning his engines, he gave the signal of a slow and formidable
retreat. The devotion of the Romans ascribed this signal deliverance to
the Virgin Mary; but the mother of Christ would surely have condemned
their inhuman murder of the Persian envoys, who were entitled to the
rights of humanity, if they were not protected by the laws of nations.
[97]

[Footnote 94: Petavius (Annotationes ad Nicephorum, p. 62, 63, 64)
discriminates the names and actions of five Persian generals who were
successively sent against Heraclius.]

[Footnote 95: This number of eight myriads is specified by George of
Pisidia, (Bell. Abar. 219.) The poet (50--88) clearly indicates that
the old chagan lived till the reign of Heraclius, and that his son and
successor was born of a foreign mother. Yet Foggini (Annotat. p. 57) has
given another interpretation to this passage.]

[Footnote 96: A bird, a frog, a mouse, and five arrows, had been the
present of the Scythian king to Darius, (Herodot. l. iv. c. 131, 132.)
Substituez une lettre a ces signes (says Rousseau, with much good
taste) plus elle sera menacante moins elle effrayera; ce ne sera qu'une
fanfarronade dont Darius n'eut fait que rire, (Emile, tom. iii. p. 146.)
Yet I much question whether the senate and people of Constantinople
laughed at this message of the chagan.]

[Footnote 97: The Paschal Chronicle (p. 392--397) gives a minute and
authentic narrative of the siege and deliverance of Constantinople
Theophanes (p. 264) adds some circumstances; and a faint light may be
obtained from the smoke of George of Pisidia, who has composed a poem
(de Bello Abarico, p. 45--54) to commemorate this auspicious event.]

After the division of his army, Heraclius prudently retired to the banks
of the Phasis, from whence he maintained a defensive war against the
fifty thousand gold spears of Persia. His anxiety was relieved by the
deliverance of Constantinople; his hopes were confirmed by a victory of
his brother Theodorus; and to the hostile league of Chosroes with the
Avars, the Roman emperor opposed the useful and honorable alliance
of the Turks. At his liberal invitation, the horde of Chozars [98]
transported their tents from the plains of the Volga to the mountains of
Georgia; Heraclius received them in the neighborhood of Teflis, and the
khan with his nobles dismounted from their horses, if we may credit the
Greeks, and fell prostrate on the ground, to adore the purple of the
Caesars. Such voluntary homage and important aid were entitled to the
warmest acknowledgments; and the emperor, taking off his own diadem,
placed it on the head of the Turkish prince, whom he saluted with a
tender embrace and the appellation of son. After a sumptuous banquet, he
presented Ziebel with the plate and ornaments, the gold, the gems, and
the silk, which had been used at the Imperial table, and, with his own
hand, distributed rich jewels and ear-rings to his new allies. In a
secret interview, he produced the portrait of his daughter Eudocia, [99]
condescended to flatter the Barbarian with the promise of a fair and
august bride; obtained an immediate succor of forty thousand horse, and
negotiated a strong diversion of the Turkish arms on the side of the
Oxus. [100] The Persians, in their turn, retreated with precipitation;
in the camp of Edessa, Heraclius reviewed an army of seventy thousand
Romans and strangers; and some months were successfully employed in
the recovery of the cities of Syria, Mesopotamia and Armenia, whose
fortifications had been imperfectly restored. Sarbar still maintained
the important station of Chalcedon; but the jealousy of Chosroes, or the
artifice of Heraclius, soon alienated the mind of that powerful satrap
from the service of his king and country. A messenger was intercepted
with a real or fictitious mandate to the cadarigan, or second in
command, directing him to send, without delay, to the throne, the head
of a guilty or unfortunate general. The despatches were transmitted to
Sarbar himself; and as soon as he read the sentence of his own death,
he dexterously inserted the names of four hundred officers, assembled
a military council, and asked the cadarigan whether he was prepared to
execute the commands of their tyrant. The Persians unanimously declared,
that Chosroes had forfeited the sceptre; a separate treaty was concluded
with the government of Constantinople; and if some considerations
of honor or policy restrained Sarbar from joining the standard of
Heraclius, the emperor was assured that he might prosecute, without
interruption, his designs of victory and peace.

[Footnote 98: The power of the Chozars prevailed in the viith, viiith,
and ixth centuries. They were known to the Greeks, the Arabs, and under
the name of Kosa, to the Chinese themselves. De Guignes, Hist. des Huns,
tom. ii. part ii. p. 507--509. * Note: Moses of Chorene speaks of an
invasion of Armenia by the Khazars in the second century, l. ii. c. 62.
M. St. Martin suspects them to be the same with the Hunnish nation
of the Acatires or Agazzires. They are called by the Greek historians
Eastern Turks; like the Madjars and other Hunnish or Finnish tribes,
they had probably received some admixture from the genuine Turkish
races. Ibn. Hankal (Oriental Geography) says that their language was
like the Bulgarian, and considers them a people of Finnish or Hunnish
race. Klaproth, Tabl. Hist. p. 268-273. Abel Remusat, Rech. sur les
Langues Tartares, tom. i. p. 315, 316. St. Martin, vol. xi. p. 115.--M]

[Footnote 99: Epiphania, or Eudocia, the only daughter of Heraclius and
his first wife Eudocia, was born at Constantinople on the 7th of July,
A.D. 611, baptized the 15th of August, and crowned (in the oratory of
St. Stephen in the palace) the 4th of October of the same year. At this
time she was about fifteen. Eudocia was afterwards sent to her Turkish
husband, but the news of his death stopped her journey, and prevented
the consummation, (Ducange, Familiae Byzantin. p. 118.)]

[Footnote 100: Elmcain (Hist. Saracen. p. 13--16) gives some curious
and probable facts; but his numbers are rather too high--300,000 Romans
assembled at Edessa--500,000 Persians killed at Nineveh. The abatement
of a cipher is scarcely enough to restore his sanity]

Deprived of his firmest support, and doubtful of the fidelity of his
subjects, the greatness of Chosroes was still conspicuous in its ruins.
The number of five hundred thousand may be interpreted as an Oriental
metaphor, to describe the men and arms, the horses and elephants, that
covered Media and Assyria against the invasion of Heraclius. Yet the
Romans boldly advanced from the Araxes to the Tigris, and the timid
prudence of Rhazates was content to follow them by forced marches
through a desolate country, till he received a peremptory mandate to
risk the fate of Persia in a decisive battle. Eastward of the Tigris,
at the end of the bridge of Mosul, the great Nineveh had formerly been
erected: [101] the city, and even the ruins of the city, had long since
disappeared; [102] the vacant space afforded a spacious field for the
operations of the two armies. But these operations are neglected by the
Byzantine historians, and, like the authors of epic poetry and romance,
they ascribe the victory, not to the military conduct, but to the
personal valor, of their favorite hero. On this memorable day,
Heraclius, on his horse Phallas, surpassed the bravest of his warriors:
his lip was pierced with a spear; the steed was wounded in the thigh;
but he carried his master safe and victorious through the triple phalanx
of the Barbarians. In the heat of the action, three valiant chiefs were
successively slain by the sword and lance of the emperor: among these
was Rhazates himself; he fell like a soldier, but the sight of his head
scattered grief and despair through the fainting ranks of the Persians.
His armor of pure and massy gold, the shield of one hundred and twenty
plates, the sword and belt, the saddle and cuirass, adorned the triumph
of Heraclius; and if he had not been faithful to Christ and his mother,
the champion of Rome might have offered the fourth opime spoils to
the Jupiter of the Capitol. [103] In the battle of Nineveh, which
was fiercely fought from daybreak to the eleventh hour, twenty-eight
standards, besides those which might be broken or torn, were taken from
the Persians; the greatest part of their army was cut in pieces, and the
victors, concealing their own loss, passed the night on the field. They
acknowledged, that on this occasion it was less difficult to kill
than to discomfit the soldiers of Chosroes; amidst the bodies of their
friends, no more than two bow-shot from the enemy the remnant of the
Persian cavalry stood firm till the seventh hour of the night; about
the eighth hour they retired to their unrifled camp, collected their
baggage, and dispersed on all sides, from the want of orders rather than
of resolution. The diligence of Heraclius was not less admirable in
the use of victory; by a march of forty-eight miles in four-and-twenty
hours, his vanguard occupied the bridges of the great and the lesser
Zab; and the cities and palaces of Assyria were open for the first
time to the Romans. By a just gradation of magnificent scenes, they
penetrated to the royal seat of Dastagerd, [1031] and, though much of
the treasure had been removed, and much had been expended, the remaining
wealth appears to have exceeded their hopes, and even to have satiated
their avarice. Whatever could not be easily transported, they consumed
with fire, that Chosroes might feel the anguish of those wounds which he
had so often inflicted on the provinces of the empire: and justice might
allow the excuse, if the desolation had been confined to the works of
regal luxury, if national hatred, military license, and religious zeal,
had not wasted with equal rage the habitations and the temples of the
guiltless subject. The recovery of three hundred Roman standards, and
the deliverance of the numerous captives of Edessa and Alexandria,
reflect a purer glory on the arms of Heraclius. From the palace
of Dastagerd, he pursued his march within a few miles of Modain or
Ctesiphon, till he was stopped, on the banks of the Arba, by the
difficulty of the passage, the rigor of the season, and perhaps the fame
of an impregnable capital. The return of the emperor is marked by the
modern name of the city of Sherhzour: he fortunately passed Mount
Zara, before the snow, which fell incessantly thirty-four days; and the
citizens of Gandzca, or Tauris, were compelled to entertain the soldiers
and their horses with a hospitable reception. [104]

[Footnote 101: Ctesias (apud Didor. Sicul. tom. i. l. ii. p. 115,
edit. Wesseling) assigns 480 stadia (perhaps only 32 miles) for the
circumference of Nineveh. Jonas talks of three days' journey: the
120,000 persons described by the prophet as incapable of discerning
their right hand from their left, may afford about 700,000 persons of
all ages for the inhabitants of that ancient capital, (Goguet, Origines
des Loix, &c., tom. iii. part i. p. 92, 93,) which ceased to exist
600 years before Christ. The western suburb still subsisted, and is
mentioned under the name of Mosul in the first age of the Arabian
khalifs.]

[Footnote 102: Niebuhr (Voyage en Arabie, &c., tom. ii. p. 286) passed
over Nineveh without perceiving it. He mistook for a ridge of hills the
old rampart of brick or earth. It is said to have been 100 feet high,
flanked with 1500 towers, each of the height of 200 feet.]

[Footnote 103: Rex regia arma fero (says Romulus, in the first
consecration).... bina postea (continues Livy, i. 10) inter tot bella,
opima parta sunt spolia, adeo rara ejus fortuna decoris. If Varro (apud
Pomp Festum, p. 306, edit. Dacier) could justify his liberality in
granting the opime spoils even to a common soldier who had slain the
king or general of the enemy, the honor would have been much more cheap
and common]

the palace of Sira on the banks of the Diala between Holwan and Kanabee.

[Footnote 104: In describing this last expedition of Heraclius, the
facts, the places, and the dates of Theophanes (p. 265--271) are so
accurate and authentic, that he must have followed the original letters
of the emperor, of which the Paschal Chronicle has preserved (p.
398--402) a very curious specimen.]

When the ambition of Chosroes was reduced to the defence of his
hereditary kingdom, the love of glory, or even the sense of shame,
should have urged him to meet his rival in the field. In the battle of
Nineveh, his courage might have taught the Persians to vanquish, or
he might have fallen with honor by the lance of a Roman emperor. The
successor of Cyrus chose rather, at a secure distance, to expect the
event, to assemble the relics of the defeat, and to retire, by measured
steps, before the march of Heraclius, till he beheld with a sigh the
once loved mansions of Dastagerd. Both his friends and enemies were
persuaded, that it was the intention of Chosroes to bury himself under
the ruins of the city and palace: and as both might have been equally
adverse to his flight, the monarch of Asia, with Sira, [1041] and three
concubines, escaped through a hole in the wall nine days before the
arrival of the Romans. The slow and stately procession in which he
showed himself to the prostrate crowd, was changed to a rapid and secret
journey; and the first evening he lodged in the cottage of a peasant,
whose humble door would scarcely give admittance to the great king.
[105] His superstition was subdued by fear: on the third day, he entered
with joy the fortifications of Ctesiphon; yet he still doubted of
his safety till he had opposed the River Tigris to the pursuit of the
Romans. The discovery of his flight agitated with terror and tumult
the palace, the city, and the camp of Dastagerd: the satraps hesitated
whether they had most to fear from their sovereign or the enemy; and
the females of the harem were astonished and pleased by the sight of
mankind, till the jealous husband of three thousand wives again confined
them to a more distant castle. At his command, the army of Dastagerd
retreated to a new camp: the front was covered by the Arba, and a line
of two hundred elephants; the troops of the more distant provinces
successively arrived, and the vilest domestics of the king and satraps
were enrolled for the last defence of the throne. It was still in the
power of Chosroes to obtain a reasonable peace; and he was repeatedly
pressed by the messengers of Heraclius to spare the blood of his
subjects, and to relieve a humane conqueror from the painful duty of
carrying fire and sword through the fairest countries of Asia. But the
pride of the Persian had not yet sunk to the level of his fortune; he
derived a momentary confidence from the retreat of the emperor; he
wept with impotent rage over the ruins of his Assyrian palaces, and
disregarded too long the rising murmurs of the nation, who complained
that their lives and fortunes were sacrificed to the obstinacy of an old
man. That unhappy old man was himself tortured with the sharpest pains
both of mind and body; and, in the consciousness of his approaching end,
he resolved to fix the tiara on the head of Merdaza, the most favored
of his sons. But the will of Chosroes was no longer revered, and
Siroes, [1051] who gloried in the rank and merit of his mother Sira, had
conspired with the malecontents to assert and anticipate the rights
of primogeniture. [106] Twenty-two satraps (they styled themselves
patriots) were tempted by the wealth and honors of a new reign: to
the soldiers, the heir of Chosroes promised an increase of pay; to
the Christians, the free exercise of their religion; to the captives,
liberty and rewards; and to the nation, instant peace and the reduction
of taxes. It was determined by the conspirators, that Siroes, with the
ensigns of royalty, should appear in the camp; and if the enterprise
should fail, his escape was contrived to the Imperial court. But the new
monarch was saluted with unanimous acclamations; the flight of Chosroes
(yet where could he have fled?) was rudely arrested, eighteen sons were
massacred [1061] before his face, and he was thrown into a dungeon,
where he expired on the fifth day. The Greeks and modern Persians
minutely describe how Chosroes was insulted, and famished, and tortured,
by the command of an inhuman son, who so far surpassed the example of
his father: but at the time of his death, what tongue would relate
the story of the parricide? what eye could penetrate into the tower of
darkness? According to the faith and mercy of his Christian enemies, he
sunk without hope into a still deeper abyss; [107] and it will not be
denied, that tyrants of every age and sect are the best entitled to such
infernal abodes. The glory of the house of Sassan ended with the life of
Chosroes: his unnatural son enjoyed only eight months the fruit of his
crimes: and in the space of four years, the regal title was assumed by
nine candidates, who disputed, with the sword or dagger, the fragments
of an exhausted monarchy. Every province, and each city of Persia, was
the scene of independence, of discord, and of blood; and the state of
anarchy prevailed about eight years longer, [1071] till the factions
were silenced and united under the common yoke of the Arabian caliphs.

Schirin rivals in Persian romance that of Joseph with Zuleika the wife

at Mahuza in Babylonia, not in the presence of Chosroes. The Syrian

[Footnote 107: On the first rumor of the death of Chosroes, an Heracliad
in two cantos was instantly published at Constantinople by George of
Pisidia, (p. 97--105.) A priest and a poet might very properly exult in
the damnation of the public enemy but such mean revenge is unworthy of a
king and a conqueror; and I am sorry to find so much black superstition
in the letter of Heraclius: he almost applauds the parricide of Siroes
as an act of piety and justice. * Note: The Mahometans show no more
charity towards the memory of Chosroes or Khoosroo Purveez. All his
reverses are ascribed to the just indignation of God, upon a monarch who
had dared, with impious and accursed hands, to tear the letter of the
Holy Prophet Mahomed. Compare note, p. 231.--M.]

Sassanian kings are found in Eutychius, (Annal. tom. ii. p. 251--256,)
who dissembles the parricide of Siroes, D'Herbelot (Bibliotheque
Orientale, p. 789,) and Assemanni, (Bibliothec. Oriental. tom. iii. p.
415--420.)]

As soon as the mountains became passable, the emperor received the
welcome news of the success of the conspiracy, the death of Chosroes,
and the elevation of his eldest son to the throne of Persia. The authors
of the revolution, eager to display their merits in the court or camp of
Tauris, preceded the ambassadors of Siroes, who delivered the letters
of their master to his brother the emperor of the Romans. [109] In the
language of the usurpers of every age, he imputes his own crimes to the
Deity, and, without degrading his equal majesty, he offers to reconcile
the long discord of the two nations, by a treaty of peace and alliance
more durable than brass or iron. The conditions of the treaty were
easily defined and faithfully executed. In the recovery of the standards
and prisoners which had fallen into the hands of the Persians, the
emperor imitated the example of Augustus: their care of the national
dignity was celebrated by the poets of the times, but the decay of
genius may be measured by the distance between Horace and George of
Pisidia: the subjects and brethren of Heraclius were redeemed from
persecution, slavery, and exile; but, instead of the Roman eagles, the
true wood of the holy cross was restored to the importunate demands of
the successor of Constantine. The victor was not ambitious of enlarging
the weakness of the empire; the son of Chosroes abandoned without regret
the conquests of his father; the Persians who evacuated the cities of
Syria and Egypt were honorably conducted to the frontier, and a war
which had wounded the vitals of the two monarchies, produced no change
in their external and relative situation. The return of Heraclius from
Tauris to Constantinople was a perpetual triumph; and after the exploits
of six glorious campaigns, he peaceably enjoyed the Sabbath of his
toils. After a long impatience, the senate, the clergy, and the people,
went forth to meet their hero, with tears and acclamations, with olive
branches and innumerable lamps; he entered the capital in a chariot
drawn by four elephants; and as soon as the emperor could disengage
himself from the tumult of public joy, he tasted more genuine
satisfaction in the embraces of his mother and his son. [110]

[Footnote 109: The letter of Siroes in the Paschal Chronicle (p. 402)
unfortunately ends before he proceeds to business. The treaty appears in
its execution in the histories of Theophanes and Nicephorus. * Note: M.

lines, but no clear sense can be made out of the fragment.--M.]

[Footnote 110: The burden of Corneille's song, "Montrez Heraclius au
peuple qui l'attend," is much better suited to the present occasion. See
his triumph in Theophanes (p. 272, 273) and Nicephorus, (p. 15, 16.) The
life of the mother and tenderness of the son are attested by George of
Pisidia, (Bell. Abar. 255, &c., p. 49.) The metaphor of the Sabbath is
used somewhat profanely by these Byzantine Christians.]

The succeeding year was illustrated by a triumph of a very different
kind, the restitution of the true cross to the holy sepulchre. Heraclius
performed in person the pilgrimage of Jerusalem, the identity of the
relic was verified by the discreet patriarch, [111] and this august
ceremony has been commemorated by the annual festival of the exaltation
of the cross. Before the emperor presumed to tread the consecrated
ground, he was instructed to strip himself of the diadem and purple,
the pomp and vanity of the world: but in the judgment of his clergy, the
persecution of the Jews was more easily reconciled with the precepts
of the gospel. [1111] He again ascended his throne to receive the
congratulations of the ambassadors of France and India: and the fame
of Moses, Alexander, and Hercules, [112] was eclipsed in the popular
estimation, by the superior merit and glory of the great Heraclius.
Yet the deliverer of the East was indigent and feeble. Of the Persian
spoils, the most valuable portion had been expended in the war,
distributed to the soldiers, or buried, by an unlucky tempest, in the
waves of the Euxine. The conscience of the emperor was oppressed by the
obligation of restoring the wealth of the clergy, which he had borrowed
for their own defence: a perpetual fund was required to satisfy these
inexorable creditors; the provinces, already wasted by the arms and
avarice of the Persians, were compelled to a second payment of the same
taxes; and the arrears of a simple citizen, the treasurer of Damascus,
were commuted to a fine of one hundred thousand pieces of gold. The loss
of two hundred thousand soldiers [113] who had fallen by the sword,
was of less fatal importance than the decay of arts, agriculture, and
population, in this long and destructive war: and although a victorious
army had been formed under the standard of Heraclius, the unnatural
effort appears to have exhausted rather than exercised their strength.
While the emperor triumphed at Constantinople or Jerusalem, an obscure
town on the confines of Syria was pillaged by the Saracens, and they
cut in pieces some troops who advanced to its relief; an ordinary and
trifling occurrence, had it not been the prelude of a mighty revolution.
These robbers were the apostles of Mahomet; their fanatic valor had
emerged from the desert; and in the last eight years of his reign,
Heraclius lost to the Arabs the same provinces which he had rescued from
the Persians.

Eutychius, (Annal. tom. ii. p. 240--248,) Nicephorus, (Brev. p. 15.) The
seals of the case had never been broken; and this preservation of the
cross is ascribed (under God) to the devotion of Queen Sira.]

[Footnote 1111: If the clergy imposed upon the kneeling and penitent
emperor the persecution of the Jews, it must be acknowledge that
provocation was not wanting; for how many of them had been eye-witnesses
of, perhaps sufferers in, the horrible atrocities committed on
the capture of the city! Yet we have no authentic account of great
severities exercised by Heraclius. The law of Hadrian was reenacted,
which prohibited the Jews from approaching within three miles of the
city--a law, which, in the present exasperated state of the Christians,
might be a measure of security of mercy, rather than of oppression.

this passage does not belong to the emperor Heraclius.]
