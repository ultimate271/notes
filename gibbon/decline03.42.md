## Chapter XXXVII: Conversion Of The Barbarians To Christianity.--Part V.

The Catholics, oppressed by royal and military force, were far superior
to their adversaries in numbers and learning. With the same weapons
which the Greek [112] and Latin fathers had already provided for the
Arian controversy, they repeatedly silenced, or vanquished, the fierce
and illiterate successors of Ulphilas. The consciousness of their
own superiority might have raised them above the arts and passions of
religious warfare. Yet, instead of assuming such honorable pride, the
orthodox theologians were tempted, by the assurance of impunity, to
compose fictions, which must be stigmatized with the epithets of
fraud and forgery. They ascribed their own polemical works to the most
venerable names of Christian antiquity; the characters of Athanasius and
Augustin were awkwardly personated by Vigilius and his disciples; [113]
and the famous creed, which so clearly expounds the mysteries of the
Trinity and the Incarnation, is deduced, with strong probability, from
this African school. [114] Even the Scriptures themselves were profaned
by their rash and sacrilegious hands. The memorable text, which asserts
the unity of the three who bear witness in heaven, [115] is condemned
by the universal silence of the orthodox fathers, ancient versions,
and authentic manuscripts. [116] It was first alleged by the Catholic
bishops whom Hunneric summoned to the conference of Carthage. [117] An
allegorical interpretation, in the form, perhaps, of a marginal note,
invaded the text of the Latin Bibles, which were renewed and corrected
in a dark period of ten centuries. [118] After the invention of
printing, [119] the editors of the Greek Testament yielded to their own
prejudices, or those of the times; [120] and the pious fraud, which
was embraced with equal zeal at Rome and at Geneva, has been infinitely
multiplied in every country and every language of modern Europe.

[Footnote 112: Fulgentius, bishop of Ruspae, in the Byzacene province,
was of a senatorial family, and had received a liberal education. He
could repeat all Homer and Menander before he was allowed to study Latin
his native tongue, (Vit. Fulgent. c. l.) Many African bishops might
understand Greek, and many Greek theologians were translated into
Latin.]

[Footnote 113: Compare the two prefaces to the Dialogue of Vigilius of
Thapsus, (p. 118, 119, edit. Chiflet.) He might amuse his learned
reader with an innocent fiction; but the subject was too grave, and the
Africans were too ignorant.]

[Footnote 114: The P. Quesnel started this opinion, which has been
favorably received. But the three following truths, however surprising
they may seem, are now universally acknowledged, (Gerard Vossius, tom.
vi. p. 516-522. Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom. viii. p. 667-671.) 1. St.
Athanasius is not the author of the creed which is so frequently read in
our churches. 2. It does not appear to have existed within a century
after his death. 3. It was originally composed in the Latin tongue, and,
consequently in the Western provinces. Gennadius patriarch of
Constantinople, was so much amazed by this extraordinary composition,
that he frankly pronounced it to be the work of a drunken man. Petav.

[Footnote 115: 1 John, v. 7. See Simon, Hist. Critique du Nouveau
Testament, part i. c. xviii. p. 203-218; and part ii. c. ix. p. 99-121;
and the elaborate Prolegomena and Annotations of Dr. Mill and Wetstein
to their editions of the Greek Testament. In 1689, the papist Simon
strove to be free; in 1707, the Protestant Mill wished to be a slave;
in 1751, the Armenian Wetstein used the liberty of his times, and of his
sect. * Note: This controversy has continued to be agitated, but with
declining interest even in the more religious part of the community; and
may now be considered to have terminated in an almost general
acquiescence of the learned to the conclusions of Porson in his Letters
to Travis. See the pamphlets of the late Bishop of Salisbury and of
Crito Cantabrigiensis, Dr. Turton of Cambridge.--M.]

[Footnote 116: Of all the Mss. now extant, above fourscore in number,
some of which are more than 1200 years old, (Wetstein ad loc.) The
orthodox copies of the Vatican, of the Complutensian editors, of Robert
Stephens, are become invisible; and the two Mss. of Dublin and Berlin
are unworthy to form an exception. See Emlyn's Works, vol. ii. p
227-255, 269-299; and M. de Missy's four ingenious letters, in tom.
viii. and ix. of the Journal Britannique.]

[Footnote 117: Or, more properly, by the four bishops who composed and
published the profession of faith in the name of their brethren. They
styled this text, luce clarius, (Victor Vitensis de Persecut. Vandal.
l. iii. c. 11, p. 54.) It is quoted soon afterwards by the African
polemics, Vigilius and Fulgentius.]

[Footnote 118: In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the Bibles were
corrected by Lanfranc, archbishop of Canterbury, and by Nicholas,
cardinal and librarian of the Roman church, secundum orthodoxam fidem,
(Wetstein, Prolegom. p. 84, 85.) Notwithstanding these corrections, the
passage is still wanting in twenty-five Latin Mss., (Wetstein ad loc.,)
the oldest and the fairest; two qualities seldom united, except in
manuscripts.]

[Footnote 119: The art which the Germans had invented was applied in
Italy to the profane writers of Rome and Greece. The original Greek of
the New Testament was published about the same time (A.D. 1514, 1516,
1520,) by the industry of Erasmus, and the munificence of Cardinal
Ximenes. The Complutensian Polyglot cost the cardinal 50,000 ducats.
See Mattaire, Annal. Typograph. tom. ii. p. 2-8, 125-133; and Wetstein,
Prolegomena, p. 116-127.]

[Footnote 120: The three witnesses have been established in our Greek
Testaments by the prudence of Erasmus; the honest bigotry of the
Complutensian editors; the typographical fraud, or error, of Robert
Stephens, in the placing a crotchet; and the deliberate falsehood, or
strange misapprehension, of Theodore Beza.]

The example of fraud must excite suspicion: and the specious miracles by
which the African Catholics have defended the truth and justice of their
cause, may be ascribed, with more reason, to their own industry, than
to the visible protection of Heaven. Yet the historian, who views this
religious conflict with an impartial eye, may condescend to mention
one preternatural event, which will edify the devout, and surprise the
incredulous. Tipasa, [121] a maritime colony of Mauritania, sixteen
miles to the east of Caesarea, had been distinguished, in every age, by
the orthodox zeal of its inhabitants. They had braved the fury of the
Donatists; [122] they resisted, or eluded, the tyranny of the Arians.
The town was deserted on the approach of an heretical bishop: most of
the inhabitants who could procure ships passed over to the coast of
Spain; and the unhappy remnant, refusing all communion with the usurper,
still presumed to hold their pious, but illegal, assemblies. Their
disobedience exasperated the cruelty of Hunneric. A military count was
despatched from Carthage to Tipasa: he collected the Catholics in the
Forum, and, in the presence of the whole province, deprived the
guilty of their right hands and their tongues. But the holy confessors
continued to speak without tongues; and this miracle is attested by
Victor, an African bishop, who published a history of the persecution
within two years after the event. [123] "If any one," says Victor,
"should doubt of the truth, let him repair to Constantinople, and listen
to the clear and perfect language of Restitutus, the sub-deacon, one of
these glorious sufferers, who is now lodged in the palace of the emperor
Zeno, and is respected by the devout empress." At Constantinople we
are astonished to find a cool, a learned, and unexceptionable witness,
without interest, and without passion. Aeneas of Gaza, a Platonic
philosopher, has accurately described his own observations on these
African sufferers. "I saw them myself: I heard them speak: I diligently
inquired by what means such an articulate voice could be formed without
any organ of speech: I used my eyes to examine the report of my ears;
I opened their mouth, and saw that the whole tongue had been completely
torn away by the roots; an operation which the physicians generally
suppose to be mortal." [124] The testimony of Aeneas of Gaza might be
confirmed by the superfluous evidence of the emperor Justinian, in a
perpetual edict; of Count Marcellinus, in his Chronicle of the times;
and of Pope Gregory the First, who had resided at Constantinople, as the
minister of the Roman pontiff. [125] They all lived within the compass
of a century; and they all appeal to their personal knowledge, or the
public notoriety, for the truth of a miracle, which was repeated in
several instances, displayed on the greatest theatre of the world, and
submitted, during a series of years, to the calm examination of the
senses. This supernatural gift of the African confessors, who spoke
without tongues, will command the assent of those, and of those only,
who already believe, that their language was pure and orthodox. But the
stubborn mind of an infidel, is guarded by secret, incurable suspicion;
and the Arian, or Socinian, who has seriously rejected the doctrine of
a Trinity, will not be shaken by the most plausible evidence of an
Athanasian miracle.

the body; besides twenty-five Epistles, still extant. See Cave, (Hist.

have specified the number of the confessors, which is fixed at sixty in
an old menology, (apud Ruinart. p. 486.) Two of them lost their speech
by fornication; but the miracle is enhanced by the singular instance of
a boy who had never spoken before his tongue was cut out. ]

The Vandals and the Ostrogoths persevered in the profession of Arianism
till the final ruin of the kingdoms which they had founded in Africa and
Italy. The Barbarians of Gaul submitted to the orthodox dominion of the
Franks; and Spain was restored to the Catholic church by the voluntary
conversion of the Visigoths.

This salutary revolution [126] was hastened by the example of a royal
martyr, whom our calmer reason may style an ungrateful rebel. Leovigild,
the Gothic monarch of Spain, deserved the respect of his enemies, and
the love of his subjects; the Catholics enjoyed a free toleration, and
his Arian synods attempted, without much success, to reconcile their
scruples by abolishing the unpopular rite of a second baptism. His
eldest son Hermenegild, who was invested by his father with the royal
diadem, and the fair principality of Boetica, contracted an honorable
and orthodox alliance with a Merovingian princess, the daughter of
Sigebert, king of Austrasia, and of the famous Brunechild. The beauteous
Ingundis, who was no more than thirteen years of age, was received,
beloved, and persecuted, in the Arian court of Toledo; and her religious
constancy was alternately assaulted with blandishments and violence by
Goisvintha, the Gothic queen, who abused the double claim of maternal
authority. [127] Incensed by her resistance, Goisvintha seized the
Catholic princess by her long hair, inhumanly dashed her against the
ground, kicked her till she was covered with blood, and at last
gave orders that she should be stripped, and thrown into a basin, or
fish-pond. [128] Love and honor might excite Hermenegild to resent this
injurious treatment of his bride; and he was gradually persuaded that
Ingundis suffered for the cause of divine truth. Her tender complaints,
and the weighty arguments of Le ander, archbishop of Seville,
accomplished his conversion and the heir of the Gothic monarchy was
initiated in the Nicene faith by the solemn rites of confirmation. [129]
The rash youth, inflamed by zeal, and perhaps by ambition, was tempted
to violate the duties of a son and a subject; and the Catholics of
Spain, although they could not complain of persecution, applauded
his pious rebellion against an heretical father. The civil war was
protracted by the long and obstinate sieges of Merida, Cordova, and
Seville, which had strenuously espoused the party of Hermenegild He
invited the orthodox Barbarians, the Seuvi, and the Franks, to the
destruction of his native land; he solicited the dangerous aid of the
Romans, who possessed Africa, and a part of the Spanish coast; and
his holy ambassador, the archbishop Leander, effectually negotiated in
person with the Byzantine court. But the hopes of the Catholics were
crushed by the active diligence of the monarch who commanded the troops
and treasures of Spain; and the guilty Hermenegild, after his vain
attempts to resist or to escape, was compelled to surrender himself into
the hands of an incensed father. Leovigild was still mindful of that
sacred character; and the rebel, despoiled of the regal ornaments, was
still permitted, in a decent exile, to profess the Catholic religion.
His repeated and unsuccessful treasons at length provoked the
indignation of the Gothic king; and the sentence of death, which he
pronounced with apparent reluctance, was privately executed in the tower
of Seville. The inflexible constancy with which he refused to accept the
Arian communion, as the price of his safety, may excuse the honors that
have been paid to the memory of St. Hermenegild. His wife and infant son
were detained by the Romans in ignominious captivity; and this domestic
misfortune tarnished the glories of Leovigild, and imbittered the last
moments of his life.

[Footnote 126: See the two general historians of Spain, Mariana (Hist.
de Rebus Hispaniae, tom. i. l. v. c. 12-15, p. 182-194) and Ferreras,
(French translation, tom. ii. p. 206-247.) Mariana almost forgets that
he is a Jesuit, to assume the style and spirit of a Roman classic.
Ferreras, an industrious compiler, reviews his facts, and rectifies his
chronology.]

[Footnote 127: Goisvintha successively married two kings of the
Visigoths: Athanigild, to whom she bore Brunechild, the mother of
Ingundis; and Leovigild, whose two sons, Hermenegild and Recared, were
the issue of a former marriage.]

[Footnote 128: Iracundiae furore succensa, adprehensam per comam capitis
puellam in terram conlidit, et diu calcibus verberatam, ac sanguins
cruentatam, jussit exspoliari, et piscinae immergi. Greg. Turon. l. v.
c. 39. in tom. ii. p. 255. Gregory is one of our best originals for this
portion of history.]

[Footnote 129: The Catholics who admitted the baptism of heretics
repeated the rite, or, as it was afterwards styled, the sacrament,
of confirmation, to which they ascribed many mystic and marvellous
prerogatives both visible and invisible. See Chardon. Hist. des
Sacremens, tom. 1. p. 405-552.] His son and successor, Recared, the
first Catholic king of Spain, had imbibed the faith of his unfortunate
brother, which he supported with more prudence and success. Instead of
revolting against his father, Recared patiently expected the hour of his
death. Instead of condemning his memory, he piously supposed, that the
dying monarch had abjured the errors of Arianism, and recommended to
his son the conversion of the Gothic nation. To accomplish that salutary
end, Recared convened an assembly of the Arian clergy and nobles,
declared himself a Catholic, and exhorted them to imitate the example
of their prince. The laborious interpretation of doubtful texts, or the
curious pursuit of metaphysical arguments, would have excited an endless
controversy; and the monarch discreetly proposed to his illiterate
audience two substantial and visible arguments,--the testimony of Earth,
and of Heaven. The Earth had submitted to the Nicene synod: the Romans,
the Barbarians, and the inhabitants of Spain, unanimously professed
the same orthodox creed; and the Visigoths resisted, almost alone, the
consent of the Christian world. A superstitious age was prepared to
reverence, as the testimony of Heaven, the preternatural cures, which
were performed by the skill or virtue of the Catholic clergy; the
baptismal fonts of Osset in Boetica, [130] which were spontaneously
replenished every year, on the vigil of Easter; [131] and the miraculous
shrine of St. Martin of Tours, which had already converted the Suevic
prince and people of Gallicia. [132] The Catholic king encountered
some difficulties on this important change of the national religion. A
conspiracy, secretly fomented by the queen-dowager, was formed against
his life; and two counts excited a dangerous revolt in the Narbonnese
Gaul. But Recared disarmed the conspirators, defeated the rebels, and
executed severe justice; which the Arians, in their turn, might brand
with the reproach of persecution. Eight bishops, whose names betray
their Barbaric origin, abjured their errors; and all the books of Arian
theology were reduced to ashes, with the house in which they had been
purposely collected. The whole body of the Visigoths and Suevi were
allured or driven into the pale of the Catholic communion; the faith, at
least of the rising generation, was fervent and sincere: and the devout
liberality of the Barbarians enriched the churches and monasteries of
Spain. Seventy bishops, assembled in the council of Toledo, received the
submission of their conquerors; and the zeal of the Spaniards improved
the Nicene creed, by declaring the procession of the Holy Ghost from
the Son, as well as from the Father; a weighty point of doctrine, which
produced, long afterwards, the schism of the Greek and Latin churches.
[133] The royal proselyte immediately saluted and consulted Pope
Gregory, surnamed the Great, a learned and holy prelate, whose reign
was distinguished by the conversion of heretics and infidels. The
ambassadors of Recared respectfully offered on the threshold of
the Vatican his rich presents of gold and gems; they accepted, as a
lucrative exchange, the hairs of St. John the Baptist; a cross, which
enclosed a small piece of the true wood; and a key, that contained some
particles of iron which had been scraped from the chains of St. Peter.
[134]

[Footnote 130: Osset, or Julia Constantia, was opposite to Seville, on
the northern side of the Boetis, (Plin. Hist. Natur. iii. 3:) and the
authentic reference of Gregory of Tours (Hist. Francor. l. vi. c. 43, p.
288) deserves more credit than the name of Lusitania, (de Gloria Martyr.
c. 24,) which has been eagerly embraced by the vain and superstitious
Portuguese, (Ferreras, Hist. d'Espagne, tom. ii. p. 166.)]

[Footnote 131: This miracle was skilfully performed. An Arian king
sealed the doors, and dug a deep trench round the church, without being
able to intercept the Easter supply of baptismal water.]

[Footnote 132: Ferreras (tom. ii. p. 168-175, A.D. 550) has illustrated
the difficulties which regard the time and circumstances of the
conversion of the Suevi. They had been recently united by Leovigild to
the Gothic monarchy of Spain.]

[Footnote 133: This addition to the Nicene, or rather the
Constantinopolitan creed, was first made in the eighth council of
Toledo, A.D. 653; but it was expressive of the popular doctrine, (Gerard
Vossius, tom. vi. p. 527, de tribus Symbolis.)]

[Footnote 134: See Gregor. Magn. l. vii. epist. 126, apud Baronium,
Annal. Eccles. A.D. 559, No. 25, 26.]

The same Gregory, the spiritual conqueror of Britain, encouraged the
pious Theodelinda, queen of the Lombards, to propagate the Nicene faith
among the victorious savages, whose recent Christianity was polluted by
the Arian heresy. Her devout labors still left room for the industry
and success of future missionaries; and many cities of Italy were still
disputed by hostile bishops. But the cause of Arianism was gradually
suppressed by the weight of truth, of interest, and of example; and
the controversy, which Egypt had derived from the Platonic school, was
terminated, after a war of three hundred years, by the final conversion
of the Lombards of Italy. [135]

[Footnote 135: Paul Warnefrid (de Gestis Langobard. l. iv. c. 44, p.
153, edit Grot.) allows that Arianism still prevailed under the reign of
Rotharis, (A.D. 636-652.) The pious deacon does not attempt to mark the
precise era of the national conversion, which was accomplished, however,
before the end of the seventh century.]

The first missionaries who preached the gospel to the Barbarians,
appealed to the evidence of reason, and claimed the benefit of
toleration. [136] But no sooner had they established their spiritual
dominion, than they exhorted the Christian kings to extirpate, without
mercy, the remains of Roman or Barbaric superstition. The successors
of Clovis inflicted one hundred lashes on the peasants who refused to
destroy their idols; the crime of sacrificing to the demons was punished
by the Anglo-Saxon laws with the heavier penalties of imprisonment and
confiscation; and even the wise Alfred adopted, as an indispensable
duty, the extreme rigor of the Mosaic institutions. [137] But the
punishment and the crime were gradually abolished among a Christian
people; the theological disputes of the schools were suspended by
propitious ignorance; and the intolerant spirit which could find neither
idolaters nor heretics, was reduced to the persecution of the Jews. That
exiled nation had founded some synagogues in the cities of Gaul;
but Spain, since the time of Hadrian, was filled with their numerous
colonies. [138] The wealth which they accumulated by trade, and the
management of the finances, invited the pious avarice of their masters;
and they might be oppressed without danger, as they had lost the use,
and even the remembrance, of arms. Sisebut, a Gothic king, who reigned
in the beginning of the seventh century, proceeded at once to the last
extremes of persecution. [139] Ninety thousand Jews were compelled to
receive the sacrament of baptism; the fortunes of the obstinate infidels
were confiscated, their bodies were tortured; and it seems doubtful
whether they were permitted to abandon their native country. The
excessive zeal of the Catholic king was moderated, even by the clergy
of Spain, who solemnly pronounced an inconsistent sentence: that the
sacraments should not be forcibly imposed; but that the Jews who had
been baptized should be constrained, for the honor of the church, to
persevere in the external practice of a religion which they disbelieved
and detested. Their frequent relapses provoked one of the successors of
Sisebut to banish the whole nation from his dominions; and a council
of Toledo published a decree, that every Gothic king should swear to
maintain this salutary edict. But the tyrants were unwilling to dismiss
the victims, whom they delighted to torture, or to deprive themselves
of the industrious slaves, over whom they might exercise a lucrative
oppression. The Jews still continued in Spain, under the weight of
the civil and ecclesiastical laws, which in the same country have been
faithfully transcribed in the Code of the Inquisition. The Gothic kings
and bishops at length discovered, that injuries will produce hatred, and
that hatred will find the opportunity of revenge. A nation, the secret
or professed enemies of Christianity, still multiplied in servitude and
distress; and the intrigues of the Jews promoted the rapid success of
the Arabian conquerors. [140]

curious circumstances, essential to his subject, though they are foreign
to mine. * Note: Compare Milman, Hist. of Jews iii. 256--M]

As soon as the Barbarians withdrew their powerful support, the unpopular
heresy of Arius sunk into contempt and oblivion. But the Greeks still
retained their subtle and loquacious disposition: the establishment of
an obscure doctrine suggested new questions, and new disputes; and it
was always in the power of an ambitious prelate, or a fanatic monk,
to violate the peace of the church, and, perhaps, of the empire. The
historian of the empire may overlook those disputes which were confined
to the obscurity of schools and synods. The Manichaeans, who labored
to reconcile the religions of Christ and of Zoroaster, had secretly
introduced themselves into the provinces: but these foreign sectaries
were involved in the common disgrace of the Gnostics, and the Imperial
laws were executed by the public hatred. The rational opinions of the
Pelagians were propagated from Britain to Rome, Africa, and Palestine,
and silently expired in a superstitious age. But the East was distracted
by the Nestorian and Eutychian controversies; which attempted to explain
the mystery of the incarnation, and hastened the ruin of Christianity in
her native land. These controversies were first agitated under the reign
of the younger Theodosius: but their important consequences extend
far beyond the limits of the present volume. The metaphysical chain of
argument, the contests of ecclesiastical ambition, and their political
influence on the decline of the Byzantine empire, may afford an
interesting and instructive series of history, from the general councils
of Ephesus and Chalcedon, to the conquest of the East by the successors
of Mahomet.
