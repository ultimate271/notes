## Chapter LII: More Conquests By The Arabs.--Part V.

The third and most obvious cause was the weight and magnitude of the
empire itself. The caliph Almamon might proudly assert, that it
was easier for him to rule the East and the West, than to manage a
chess-board of two feet square: [102] yet I suspect that in both those
games he was guilty of many fatal mistakes; and I perceive, that in the
distant provinces the authority of the first and most powerful of the
Abbassides was already impaired. The analogy of despotism invests the
representative with the full majesty of the prince; the division and
balance of powers might relax the habits of obedience, might encourage
the passive subject to inquire into the origin and administration of
civil government. He who is born in the purple is seldom worthy to
reign; but the elevation of a private man, of a peasant, perhaps, or
a slave, affords a strong presumption of his courage and capacity.
The viceroy of a remote kingdom aspires to secure the property and
inheritance of his precarious trust; the nations must rejoice in the
presence of their sovereign; and the command of armies and treasures
are at once the object and the instrument of his ambition. A change was
scarcely visible as long as the lieutenants of the caliph were content
with their vicarious title; while they solicited for themselves or their
sons a renewal of the Imperial grant, and still maintained on the coin
and in the public prayers the name and prerogative of the commander of
the faithful. But in the long and hereditary exercise of power, they
assumed the pride and attributes of royalty; the alternative of peace
or war, of reward or punishment, depended solely on their will; and the
revenues of their government were reserved for local services or
private magnificence. Instead of a regular supply of men and money, the
successors of the prophet were flattered with the ostentatious gift of
an elephant, or a cast of hawks, a suit of silk hangings, or some pounds
of musk and amber. [103]

Annals of Elmacin, Abulpharagius, and Abulfeda, under the proper years,
in the dictionary of D'Herbelot, under the proper names. The tables of
M. de Guignes (Hist. des Huns, tom. i.) exhibit a general chronology
of the East, interspersed with some historical anecdotes; but his
attachment to national blood has sometimes confounded the order of time
and place.]

After the revolt of Spain from the temporal and spiritual supremacy of
the Abbassides, the first symptoms of disobedience broke forth in the
province of Africa. Ibrahim, the son of Aglab, the lieutenant of the
vigilant and rigid Harun, bequeathed to the dynasty of the Aglabites
the inheritance of his name and power. The indolence or policy of the
caliphs dissembled the injury and loss, and pursued only with poison the
founder of the Edrisites, [104] who erected the kingdom and city of Fez
on the shores of the Western ocean. [105] In the East, the first dynasty
was that of the Taherites; [106] the posterity of the valiant Taher,
who, in the civil wars of the sons of Harun, had served with too much
zeal and success the cause of Almamon, the younger brother. He was
sent into honorable exile, to command on the banks of the Oxus; and the
independence of his successors, who reigned in Chorasan till the fourth
generation, was palliated by their modest and respectful demeanor, the
happiness of their subjects and the security of their frontier. They
were supplanted by one of those adventures so frequent in the annals
of the East, who left his trade of a brazier (from whence the name of
Soffarides) for the profession of a robber. In a nocturnal visit to the
treasure of the prince of Sistan, Jacob, the son of Leith, stumbled over
a lump of salt, which he unwarily tasted with his tongue. Salt, among
the Orientals, is the symbol of hospitality, and the pious robber
immediately retired without spoil or damage. The discovery of this
honorable behavior recommended Jacob to pardon and trust; he led an army
at first for his benefactor, at last for himself, subdued Persia, and
threatened the residence of the Abbassides. On his march towards Bagdad,
the conqueror was arrested by a fever. He gave audience in bed to the
ambassador of the caliph; and beside him on a table were exposed a naked
cimeter, a crust of brown bread, and a bunch of onions. "If I die,"
said he, "your master is delivered from his fears. If I live, this
must determine between us. If I am vanquished, I can return without
reluctance to the homely fare of my youth." From the height where he
stood, the descent would not have been so soft or harmless: a timely
death secured his own repose and that of the caliph, who paid with the
most lavish concessions the retreat of his brother Amrou to the palaces
of Shiraz and Ispahan. The Abbassides were too feeble to contend, too
proud to forgive: they invited the powerful dynasty of the Samanides,
who passed the Oxus with ten thousand horse so poor, that their stirrups
were of wood: so brave, that they vanquished the Soffarian army, eight
times more numerous than their own. The captive Amrou was sent in
chains, a grateful offering to the court of Bagdad; and as the victor
was content with the inheritance of Transoxiana and Chorasan, the realms
of Persia returned for a while to the allegiance of the caliphs. The
provinces of Syria and Egypt were twice dismembered by their Turkish
slaves of the race of Toulon and Ilkshid. [107] These Barbarians, in
religion and manners the countrymen of Mahomet, emerged from the bloody
factions of the palace to a provincial command and an independent
throne: their names became famous and formidable in their time; but the
founders of these two potent dynasties confessed, either in words or
actions, the vanity of ambition. The first on his death-bed implored the
mercy of God to a sinner, ignorant of the limits of his own power:
the second, in the midst of four hundred thousand soldiers and eight
thousand slaves, concealed from every human eye the chamber where he
attempted to sleep. Their sons were educated in the vices of kings;
and both Egypt and Syria were recovered and possessed by the Abbassides
during an interval of thirty years. In the decline of their empire,
Mesopotamia, with the important cities of Mosul and Aleppo, was occupied
by the Arabian princes of the tribe of Hamadan. The poets of their court
could repeat without a blush, that nature had formed their countenances
for beauty, their tongues for eloquence, and their hands for liberality
and valor: but the genuine tale of the elevation and reign of the
Hamadanites exhibits a scene of treachery, murder, and parricide.

At the same fatal period, the Persian kingdom was again usurped by
the dynasty of the Bowides, by the sword of three brothers, who, under
various names, were styled the support and columns of the state, and
who, from the Caspian Sea to the ocean, would suffer no tyrants but
themselves. Under their reign, the language and genius of Persia
revived, and the Arabs, three hundred and four years after the death of
Mahomet, were deprived of the sceptre of the East.

[Footnote 104: The Aglabites and Edrisites are the professed subject of
M. de Cardonne, (Hist. de l'Afrique et de l'Espagne sous la Domination
des Arabes, tom. ii. p. 1-63.)]

[Footnote 105: To escape the reproach of error, I must criticize the
inaccuracies of M. de Guignes (tom. i. p. 359) concerning the Edrisites.
1. The dynasty and city of Fez could not be founded in the year of the
Hegira 173, since the founder was a posthumous child of a descendant of
Ali, who fled from Mecca in the year 168. 2. This founder, Edris, the
son of Edris, instead of living to the improbable age of 120 years, A.
H. 313, died A. H. 214, in the prime of manhood. 3. The dynasty ended A.
H. 307, twenty-three years sooner than it is fixed by the historian of
the Huns. See the accurate Annals of Abulfeda p. 158, 159, 185, 238.]

[Footnote 106: The dynasties of the Taherites and Soffarides, with the
rise of that of the Samanines, are described in the original history and
Latin version of Mirchond: yet the most interesting facts had already
been drained by the diligence of M. D'Herbelot.]

[Footnote 107: M. de Guignes (Hist. des Huns, tom. iii. p. 124-154) has
exhausted the Toulunides and Ikshidites of Egypt, and thrown some light
on the Carmathians and Hamadanites.]

Rahadi, the twentieth of the Abbassides, and the thirty-ninth of the
successors of Mahomet, was the last who deserved the title of commander
of the faithful; [108] the last (says Abulfeda) who spoke to the people,
or conversed with the learned; the last who, in the expense of his
household, represented the wealth and magnificence of the ancient
caliphs. After him, the lords of the Eastern world were reduced to the
most abject misery, and exposed to the blows and insults of a servile
condition. The revolt of the provinces circumscribed their dominions
within the walls of Bagdad: but that capital still contained an
innumerable multitude, vain of their past fortune, discontented with
their present state, and oppressed by the demands of a treasury which
had formerly been replenished by the spoil and tribute of nations. Their
idleness was exercised by faction and controversy. Under the mask of
piety, the rigid followers of Hanbal [109] invaded the pleasures of
domestic life, burst into the houses of plebeians and princes, the wine,
broke the instruments, beat the musicians, and dishonored, with infamous
suspicions, the associates of every handsome youth. In each profession,
which allowed room for two persons, the one was a votary, the other an
antagonist, of Ali; and the Abbassides were awakened by the clamorous
grief of the sectaries, who denied their title, and cursed their
progenitors. A turbulent people could only be repressed by a military
force; but who could satisfy the avarice or assert the discipline of the
mercenaries themselves? The African and the Turkish guards drew their
swords against each other, and the chief commanders, the emirs al Omra,
[110] imprisoned or deposed their sovereigns, and violated the sanctuary
of the mosch and harem. If the caliphs escaped to the camp or court of
any neighboring prince, their deliverance was a change of servitude,
till they were prompted by despair to invite the Bowides, the sultans of
Persia, who silenced the factions of Bagdad by their irresistible arms.
The civil and military powers were assumed by Moezaldowlat, the second
of the three brothers, and a stipend of sixty thousand pounds sterling
was assigned by his generosity for the private expense of the commander
of the faithful. But on the fortieth day, at the audience of the
ambassadors of Chorasan, and in the presence of a trembling multitude,
the caliph was dragged from his throne to a dungeon, by the command
of the stranger, and the rude hands of his Dilamites. His palace was
pillaged, his eyes were put out, and the mean ambition of the Abbassides
aspired to the vacant station of danger and disgrace. In the school
of adversity, the luxurious caliphs resumed the grave and abstemious
virtues of the primitive times. Despoiled of their armor and silken
robes, they fasted, they prayed, they studied the Koran and the
tradition of the Sonnites: they performed, with zeal and knowledge,
the functions of their ecclesiastical character. The respect of nations
still waited on the successors of the apostle, the oracles of the law
and conscience of the faithful; and the weakness or division of their
tyrants sometimes restored the Abbassides to the sovereignty of
Bagdad. But their misfortunes had been imbittered by the triumph of
the Fatimites, the real or spurious progeny of Ali. Arising from the
extremity of Africa, these successful rivals extinguished, in Egypt and
Syria, both the spiritual and temporal authority of the Abbassides; and
the monarch of the Nile insulted the humble pontiff on the banks of the
Tigris.

as the manner and tone of Abulfeda, but the cast of Latin eloquence
belongs more properly to Reiske. The Arabian historian (p. 255, 257,
261-269, 283, &c.) has supplied me with the most interesting facts of
this paragraph.]

more indulgent and tolerating spirit. Ahmed Ebn Hanbal, the head of one
of the four orthodox sects, was born at Bagdad A. H. 164, and died there
A. H. 241. He fought and suffered in the dispute concerning the creation
of the Koran.]

[Footnote 110: The office of vizier was superseded by the emir al Omra,
Imperator Imperatorum, a title first instituted by Radhi, and which
merged at length in the Bowides and Seljukides: vectigalibus, et
tributis, et curiis per omnes regiones praefecit, jussitque in omnibus
suggestis nominis ejus in concionibus mentionem fieri, (Abulpharagius,
Dynart. p 199.) It is likewise mentioned by Elmacin, (p. 254, 255.)]

In the declining age of the caliphs, in the century which elapsed after
the war of Theophilus and Motassem, the hostile transactions of the two
nations were confined to some inroads by sea and land, the fruits of
their close vicinity and indelible hatred. But when the Eastern world
was convulsed and broken, the Greeks were roused from their lethargy
by the hopes of conquest and revenge. The Byzantine empire, since the
accession of the Basilian race, had reposed in peace and dignity; and
they might encounter with their entire strength the front of some petty
emir, whose rear was assaulted and threatened by his national foes of
the Mahometan faith. The lofty titles of the morning star, and the
death of the Saracens, [111] were applied in the public acclamations to
Nicephorus Phocas, a prince as renowned in the camp, as he was unpopular
in the city. In the subordinate station of great domestic, or general
of the East, he reduced the Island of Crete, and extirpated the nest
of pirates who had so long defied, with impunity, the majesty of the
empire. [112] His military genius was displayed in the conduct and
success of the enterprise, which had so often failed with loss and
dishonor. The Saracens were confounded by the landing of his troops on
safe and level bridges, which he cast from the vessels to the shore.
Seven months were consumed in the siege of Candia; the despair of the
native Cretans was stimulated by the frequent aid of their brethren of
Africa and Spain; and after the massy wall and double ditch had been
stormed by the Greeks a hopeless conflict was still maintained in the
streets and houses of the city. [1121] The whole island was subdued in
the capital, and a submissive people accepted, without resistance,
the baptism of the conqueror. [113] Constantinople applauded the
long-forgotten pomp of a triumph; but the Imperial diadem was the
sole reward that could repay the services, or satisfy the ambition, of
Nicephorus.

[Footnote 111: Liutprand, whose choleric temper was imbittered by his
uneasy situation, suggests the names of reproach and contempt more
applicable to Nicephorus than the vain titles of the Greeks, Ecce venit
stella matutina, surgit Eous, reverberat obtutu solis radios, pallida
Saracenorum mors, Nicephorus.]

[Footnote 112: Notwithstanding the insinuation of Zonaras, &c., (tom.
ii. l. xvi. p. 197,) it is an undoubted fact, that Crete was completely
and finally subdued by Nicephorus Phocas, (Pagi, Critica, tom. iii. p.
873-875. Meursius, Creta, l. iii. c. 7, tom. iii. p. 464, 465.)]

[Footnote 1121: The Acroases of Theodorus, de expugnatione Cretae,
miserable iambics, relate the whole campaign. Whoever would fairly
estimate the merit of the poetic deacon, may read the description of the
slinging a jackass into the famishing city. The poet is in a transport
at the wit of the general, and revels in the luxury of antithesis.

[Footnote 113: A Greek Life of St. Nicon the Armenian was found in the
Sforza library, and translated into Latin by the Jesuit Sirmond, for the
use of Cardinal Baronius. This contemporary legend casts a ray of
light on Crete and Peloponnesus in the 10th century. He found the
newly-recovered island, foedis detestandae Agarenorum superstitionis
vestigiis adhuc plenam ac refertam.... but the victorious missionary,
perhaps with some carnal aid, ad baptismum omnes veraeque fidei
disciplinam pepulit. Ecclesiis per totam insulam aedificatis, &c.,
(Annal. Eccles. A.D. 961.)]

After the death of the younger Romanus, the fourth in lineal descent of
the Basilian race, his widow Theophania successively married Nicephorus
Phocas and his assassin John Zimisces, the two heroes of the age. They
reigned as the guardians and colleagues of her infant sons; and the
twelve years of their military command form the most splendid period of
the Byzantine annals. The subjects and confederates, whom they led to
war, appeared, at least in the eyes of an enemy, two hundred thousand
strong; and of these about thirty thousand were armed with cuirasses:
[114] a train of four thousand mules attended their march; and their
evening camp was regularly fortified with an enclosure of iron spikes.
A series of bloody and undecisive combats is nothing more than an
anticipation of what would have been effected in a few years by the
course of nature; but I shall briefly prosecute the conquests of the
two emperors from the hills of Cappadocia to the desert of Bagdad. The
sieges of Mopsuestia and Tarsus, in Cilicia, first exercised the skill
and perseverance of their troops, on whom, at this moment, I shall not
hesitate to bestow the name of Romans. In the double city of Mopsuestia,
which is divided by the River Sarus, two hundred thousand Moslems
were predestined to death or slavery, [115] a surprising degree of
population, which must at least include the inhabitants of the dependent
districts. They were surrounded and taken by assault; but Tarsus was
reduced by the slow progress of famine; and no sooner had the Saracens
yielded on honorable terms than they were mortified by the distant and
unprofitable view of the naval succors of Egypt. They were dismissed
with a safe-conduct to the confines of Syria: a part of the old
Christians had quietly lived under their dominion; and the vacant
habitations were replenished by a new colony. But the mosch was
converted into a stable; the pulpit was delivered to the flames; many
rich crosses of gold and gems, the spoils of Asiatic churches, were
made a grateful offering to the piety or avarice of the emperor; and he
transported the gates of Mopsuestia and Tarsus, which were fixed in the
walls of Constantinople, an eternal monument of his victory. After they
had forced and secured the narrow passes of Mount Amanus, the two Roman
princes repeatedly carried their arms into the heart of Syria. Yet,
instead of assaulting the walls of Antioch, the humanity or superstition
of Nicephorus appeared to respect the ancient metropolis of the East: he
contented himself with drawing round the city a line of circumvallation;
left a stationary army; and instructed his lieutenant to expect, without
impatience, the return of spring. But in the depth of winter, in a dark
and rainy night, an adventurous subaltern, with three hundred soldiers,
approached the rampart, applied his scaling-ladders, occupied two
adjacent towers, stood firm against the pressure of multitudes, and
bravely maintained his post till he was relieved by the tardy, though
effectual, support of his reluctant chief. The first tumult of slaughter
and rapine subsided; the reign of Caesar and of Christ was restored; and
the efforts of a hundred thousand Saracens, of the armies of Syria and
the fleets of Africa, were consumed without effect before the walls of
Antioch. The royal city of Aleppo was subject to Seifeddowlat, of
the dynasty of Hamadan, who clouded his past glory by the precipitate
retreat which abandoned his kingdom and capital to the Roman invaders.
In his stately palace, that stood without the walls of Aleppo, they
joyfully seized a well-furnished magazine of arms, a stable of fourteen
hundred mules, and three hundred bags of silver and gold. But the walls
of the city withstood the strokes of their battering-rams: and the
besiegers pitched their tents on the neighboring mountain of Jaushan.
Their retreat exasperated the quarrel of the townsmen and mercenaries;
the guard of the gates and ramparts was deserted; and while they
furiously charged each other in the market-place, they were surprised
and destroyed by the sword of a common enemy. The male sex was
exterminated by the sword; ten thousand youths were led into captivity;
the weight of the precious spoil exceeded the strength and number of
the beasts of burden; the superfluous remainder was burnt; and, after
a licentious possession of ten days, the Romans marched away from the
naked and bleeding city. In their Syrian inroads they commanded the
husbandmen to cultivate their lands, that they themselves, in the
ensuing season, might reap the benefit; more than a hundred cities were
reduced to obedience; and eighteen pulpits of the principal moschs were
committed to the flames to expiate the sacrilege of the disciples of
Mahomet. The classic names of Hierapolis, Apamea, and Emesa, revive for
a moment in the list of conquest: the emperor Zimisces encamped in the
paradise of Damascus, and accepted the ransom of a submissive people;
and the torrent was only stopped by the impregnable fortress of
Tripoli, on the sea-coast of Phoenicia. Since the days of Heraclius, the
Euphrates, below the passage of Mount Taurus, had been impervious, and
almost invisible, to the Greeks.

The river yielded a free passage to the victorious Zimisces; and the
historian may imitate the speed with which he overran the once famous
cities of Samosata, Edessa, Martyropolis, Amida, [116] and Nisibis, the
ancient limit of the empire in the neighborhood of the Tigris. His
ardor was quickened by the desire of grasping the virgin treasures of
Ecbatana, [117] a well-known name, under which the Byzantine writer
has concealed the capital of the Abbassides. The consternation of the
fugitives had already diffused the terror of his name; but the fancied
riches of Bagdad had already been dissipated by the avarice and
prodigality of domestic tyrants. The prayers of the people, and the
stern demands of the lieutenant of the Bowides, required the caliph to
provide for the defence of the city. The helpless Mothi replied, that
his arms, his revenues, and his provinces, had been torn from his hands,
and that he was ready to abdicate a dignity which he was unable to
support. The emir was inexorable; the furniture of the palace was sold;
and the paltry price of forty thousand pieces of gold was instantly
consumed in private luxury. But the apprehensions of Bagdad were
relieved by the retreat of the Greeks: thirst and hunger guarded the
desert of Mesopotamia; and the emperor, satiated with glory, and laden
with Oriental spoils, returned to Constantinople, and displayed, in his
triumph, the silk, the aromatics, and three hundred myriads of gold and
silver. Yet the powers of the East had been bent, not broken, by this
transient hurricane. After the departure of the Greeks, the fugitive
princes returned to their capitals; the subjects disclaimed their
involuntary oaths of allegiance; the Moslems again purified their
temples, and overturned the idols of the saints and martyrs; the
Nestorians and Jacobites preferred a Saracen to an orthodox master; and
the numbers and spirit of the Melchites were inadequate to the support
of the church and state.

Of these extensive conquests, Antioch, with the cities of Cilicia and
the Isle of Cyprus, was alone restored, a permanent and useful accession
to the Roman empire. [118]

[Footnote 114: Elmacin, Hist. Saracen. p. 278, 279. Liutprand was
disposed to depreciate the Greek power, yet he owns that Nicephorus led
against Assyria an army of eighty thousand men.]

[Footnote 115: Ducenta fere millia hominum numerabat urbs (Abulfeda,
Annal. Moslem. p. 231) of Mopsuestia, or Masifa, Mampsysta, Mansista,
Mamista, as it is corruptly, or perhaps more correctly, styled in the
middle ages, (Wesseling, Itinerar. p. 580.) Yet I cannot credit this
extreme populousness a few years after the testimony of the emperor Leo,
(Tactica, c. xviii. in Meursii Oper. tom. vi. p. 817.)]

[Footnote 116: The text of Leo the deacon, in the corrupt names of
Emeta and Myctarsim, reveals the cities of Amida and Martyropolis, (Mia
farekin. See Abulfeda, Geograph. p. 245, vers. Reiske.) Of the former,
Leo observes, urbus munita et illustris; of the latter, clara atque
conspicua opibusque et pecore, reliquis ejus provinciis urbibus atque
oppidis longe praestans.]

iv. p. 34.) This splendid description suits only with Bagdad, and cannot
possibly apply either to Hamadan, the true Ecbatana, (D'Anville, Geog.
Ancienne, tom. ii. p. 237,) or Tauris, which has been commonly mistaken
for that city. The name of Ecbatana, in the same indefinite sense, is
transferred by a more classic authority (Cicero pro Lego Manilia, c. 4)
to the royal seat of Mithridates, king of Pontus.]
