The Gauls, [1] who impatiently supported the Roman yoke, received a
memorable lesson from one of the lieutenants of Vespasian, whose weighty
sense has been refined and expressed by the genius of Tacitus. [2] "The
protection of the republic has delivered Gaul from internal discord
and foreign invasions. By the loss of national independence, you have
acquired the name and privileges of Roman citizens. You enjoy, in common
with yourselves, the permanent benefits of civil government; and your
remote situation is less exposed to the accidental mischiefs of tyranny.
Instead of exercising the rights of conquest, we have been contented to
impose such tributes as are requisite for your own preservation. Peace
cannot be secured without armies; and armies must be supported at the
expense of the people. It is for your sake, not for our own, that we
guard the barrier of the Rhine against the ferocious Germans, who have
so often attempted, and who will always desire, to exchange the solitude
of their woods and morasses for the wealth and fertility of Gaul. The
fall of Rome would be fatal to the provinces; and you would be buried in
the ruins of that mighty fabric, which has been raised by the valor and
wisdom of eight hundred years. Your imaginary freedom would be insulted
and oppressed by a savage master; and the expulsion of the Romans would
be succeeded by the eternal hostilities of the Barbarian conquerors."
[3] This salutary advice was accepted, and this strange prediction was
accomplished. In the space of four hundred years, the hardy Gauls, who
had encountered the arms of Caesar, were imperceptibly melted into the
general mass of citizens and subjects: the Western empire was dissolved;
and the Germans, who had passed the Rhine, fiercely contended for the
possession of Gaul, and excited the contempt, or abhorrence, of its
peaceful and polished inhabitants. With that conscious pride which
the preeminence of knowledge and luxury seldom fails to inspire, they
derided the hairy and gigantic savages of the North; their rustic
manners, dissonant joy, voracious appetite, and their horrid appearance,
equally disgusting to the sight and to the smell. The liberal studies
were still cultivated in the schools of Autun and Bordeaux; and the
language of Cicero and Virgil was familiar to the Gallic youth. Their
ears were astonished by the harsh and unknown sounds of the Germanic
dialect, and they ingeniously lamented that the trembling muses fled
from the harmony of a Burgundian lyre. The Gauls were endowed with all
the advantages of art and nature; but as they wanted courage to defend
them, they were justly condemned to obey, and even to flatter, the
victorious Barbarians, by whose clemency they held their precarious
fortunes and their lives. [4]

[Footnote 1: In this chapter I shall draw my quotations from the Recueil
des Historiens des Gaules et de la France, Paris, 1738-1767, in
eleven volumes in folio. By the labor of Dom Bouquet, and the other
Benedictines, all the original testimonies, as far as A.D. 1060, are
disposed in chronological order, and illustrated with learned notes.
Such a national work, which will be continued to the year 1500, might
provoke our emulation.]

[Footnote 2: Tacit. Hist. iv. 73, 74, in tom. i. p. 445. To abridge
Tacitus would indeed be presumptuous; but I may select the general ideas
which he applies to the present state and future revelations of Gaul.]

[Footnote 3: Eadem semper causa Germanis transcendendi in Gallias
libido atque avaritiae et mutandae sedis amor; ut relictis paludibus
et solitudinibus, suis, fecundissimum hoc solum vosque ipsos

gentium exsistent?]

[Footnote 4: Sidonius Apollinaris ridicules, with affected wit and
pleasantry, the hardships of his situation, (Carm. xii. in tom. i. p.
811.)]

As soon as Odoacer had extinguished the Western empire, he sought the
friendship of the most powerful of the Barbarians. The new sovereign of
Italy resigned to Euric, king of the Visigoths, all the Roman conquests
beyond the Alps, as far as the Rhine and the Ocean: [5] and the senate
might confirm this liberal gift with some ostentation of power, and
without any real loss of revenue and dominion. The lawful pretensions
of Euric were justified by ambition and success; and the Gothic nation
might aspire, under his command, to the monarchy of Spain and Gaul.
Arles and Marseilles surrendered to his arms: he oppressed the freedom
of Auvergne; and the bishop condescended to purchase his recall from
exile by a tribute of just, but reluctant praise. Sidonius waited before
the gates of the palace among a crowd of ambassadors and suppliants; and
their various business at the court of Bordeaux attested the power,
and the renown, of the king of the Visigoths. The Heruli of the distant
ocean, who painted their naked bodies with its coerulean color, implored
his protection; and the Saxons respected the maritime provinces of
a prince, who was destitute of any naval force. The tall Burgundians
submitted to his authority; nor did he restore the captive Franks, till
he had imposed on that fierce nation the terms of an unequal peace. The
Vandals of Africa cultivated his useful friendship; and the Ostrogoths
of Pannonia were supported by his powerful aid against the oppression of
the neighboring Huns. The North (such are the lofty strains of the poet)
was agitated or appeased by the nod of Euric; the great king of Persia
consulted the oracle of the West; and the aged god of the Tyber was
protected by the swelling genius of the Garonne. [6] The fortune of
nations has often depended on accidents; and France may ascribe her
greatness to the premature death of the Gothic king, at a time when
his son Alaric was a helpless infant, and his adversary Clovis [7] an
ambitious and valiant youth.

[Footnote 5: See Procopius de Bell. Gothico, l. i. c. 12, in tom. ii.
p. 81. The character of Grotius inclines me to believe, that he has not
substituted the Rhine for the Rhone (Hist. Gothorum, p. 175) without the
authority of some Ms.]

[Footnote 6: Sidonius, l. viii. epist. 3, 9, in tom. i. p. 800.
Jornandes (de Rebus Geticis, c. 47 p. 680) justifies, in some measure,
this portrait of the Gothic hero.]

[Footnote 7: I use the familiar appellation of Clovis, from the Latin
Chlodovechus, or Chlodovoeus. But the Ch expresses only the German
aspiration, and the true name is not different from Lewis, (Mem. de
'Academie des Inscriptions, tom. xx. p. 68.)]

While Childeric, the father of Clovis, lived an exile in Germany, he
was hospitably entertained by the queen, as well as by the king, of the
Thuringians. After his restoration, Basina escaped from her husband's
bed to the arms of her lover; freely declaring, that if she had known a
man wiser, stronger, or more beautiful, than Childeric, that man should
have been the object of her preference. [8] Clovis was the offspring
of this voluntary union; and, when he was no more than fifteen years of
age, he succeeded, by his father's death, to the command of the Salian
tribe. The narrow limits of his kingdom were confined to the island of
the Batavians, with the ancient dioceses of Tournay and Arras; [10] and
at the baptism of Clovis the number of his warriors could not exceed
five thousand. The kindred tribes of the Franks, who had seated
themselves along the Belgic rivers, the Scheld, the Meuse, the Moselle,
and the Rhine, were governed by their independent kings, of the
Merovingian race; the equals, the allies, and sometimes the enemies of
the Salic prince. But the Germans, who obeyed, in peace, the hereditary
jurisdiction of their chiefs, were free to follow the standard of
a popular and victorious general; and the superior merit of Clovis
attracted the respect and allegiance of the national confederacy. When
he first took the field, he had neither gold and silver in his coffers,
nor wine and corn in his magazine; [11] but he imitated the example of
Caesar, who, in the same country, had acquired wealth by the sword, and
purchased soldiers with the fruits of conquest. After each successful
battle or expedition, the spoils were accumulated in one common
mass; every warrior received his proportionable share; and the royal
prerogative submitted to the equal regulations of military law.
The untamed spirit of the Barbarians was taught to acknowledge the
advantages of regular discipline. [12] At the annual review of the month
of March, their arms were diligently inspected; and when they traversed
a peaceful territory, they were prohibited from touching a blade
of grass. The justice of Clovis was inexorable; and his careless or
disobedient soldiers were punished with instant death. It would be
superfluous to praise the valor of a Frank; but the valor of Clovis was
directed by cool and consummate prudence. [13] In all his transactions
with mankind, he calculated the weight of interest, of passion, and
of opinion; and his measures were sometimes adapted to the sanguinary
manners of the Germans, and sometimes moderated by the milder genius
of Rome, and Christianity. He was intercepted in the career of victory,
since he died in the forty-fifth year of his age: but he had already
accomplished, in a reign of thirty years, the establishment of the
French monarchy in Gaul.

[Footnote 8: Greg. l. ii. c. 12, in tom. i. p. 168. Basina speaks the
language of nature; the Franks, who had seen her in their youth, might
converse with Gregory in their old age; and the bishop of Tours could
not wish to defame the mother of the first Christian king.]

[Footnote 9: The Abbe Dubos (Hist. Critique de l'Etablissement de la
Monarchie Francoise dans les Gaules, tom. i. p. 630-650) has the merit
of defining the primitive kingdom of Clovis, and of ascertaining the
genuine number of his subjects.]

[Footnote 10: Ecclesiam incultam ac negligentia civium Paganorum
praetermis sam, veprium densitate oppletam, &c. Vit. St. Vedasti, in
tom. iii. p. 372. This description supposes that Arras was possessed by
the Pagans many years before the baptism of Clovis.]

[Footnote 11: Gregory of Tours (l v. c. i. tom. ii. p. 232) contrasts
the poverty of Clovis with the wealth of his grandsons. Yet Remigius
(in tom. iv. p. 52) mentions his paternas opes, as sufficient for the
redemption of captives.]

[Footnote 12: See Gregory, (l. ii. c. 27, 37, in tom. ii. p. 175, 181,
182.) The famous story of the vase of Soissons explains both the power
and the character of Clovis. As a point of controversy, it has been
strangely tortured by Boulainvilliers Dubos, and the other political
antiquarians.]

[Footnote 13: The duke of Nivernois, a noble statesman, who has managed
weighty and delicate negotiations, ingeniously illustrates (Mem. de
l'Acad. des Inscriptions, tom. xx. p. 147-184) the political system of
Clovis.]

The first exploit of Clovis was the defeat of Syagrius, the son of
Aegidius; and the public quarrel might, on this occasion, be inflamed
by private resentment. The glory of the father still insulted the
Merovingian race; the power of the son might excite the jealous ambition
of the king of the Franks. Syagrius inherited, as a patrimonial estate,
the city and diocese of Soissons: the desolate remnant of the second
Belgic, Rheims and Troyes, Beauvais and Amiens, would naturally submit
to the count or patrician: [14] and after the dissolution of the Western
empire, he might reign with the title, or at least with the authority,
of king of the Romans. [15] As a Roman, he had been educated in the
liberal studies of rhetoric and jurisprudence; but he was engaged by
accident and policy in the familiar use of the Germanic idiom. The
independent Barbarians resorted to the tribunal of a stranger, who
possessed the singular talent of explaining, in their native tongue,
the dictates of reason and equity. The diligence and affability of their
judge rendered him popular, the impartial wisdom of his decrees obtained
their voluntary obedience, and the reign of Syagrius over the Franks and
Burgundians seemed to revive the original institution of civil society.
[16] In the midst of these peaceful occupations, Syagrius received,
and boldly accepted, the hostile defiance of Clovis; who challenged his
rival in the spirit, and almost in the language, of chivalry, to appoint
the day and the field [17] of battle. In the time of Caesar Soissons
would have poured forth a body of fifty thousand horse and such an
army might have been plentifully supplied with shields, cuirasses, and
military engines, from the three arsenals or manufactures of the city.
[18] But the courage and numbers of the Gallic youth were long since
exhausted; and the loose bands of volunteers, or mercenaries, who
marched under the standard of Syagrius, were incapable of contending
with the national valor of the Franks. It would be ungenerous without
some more accurate knowledge of his strength and resources, to condemn
the rapid flight of Syagrius, who escaped, after the loss of a battle,
to the distant court of Thoulouse. The feeble minority of Alaric could
not assist or protect an unfortunate fugitive; the pusillanimous [19]
Goths were intimidated by the menaces of Clovis; and the Roman
king, after a short confinement, was delivered into the hands of the
executioner. The Belgic cities surrendered to the king of the Franks;
and his dominions were enlarged towards the East by the ample diocese of
Tongres [20] which Clovis subdued in the tenth year of his reign.

[Footnote 14: M. Biet (in a Dissertation which deserved the prize of the
Academy of Soissons, p. 178-226,) has accurately defined the nature and
extent of the kingdom of Syagrius and his father; but he too readily
allows the slight evidence of Dubos (tom. ii. p. 54-57) to deprive him
of Beauvais and Amiens.]

[Footnote 15: I may observe that Fredegarius, in his epitome of Gregory
of Tours, (tom. ii. p. 398,) has prudently substituted the name of
Patricius for the incredible title of Rex Romanorum.]

[Footnote 16: Sidonius, (l. v. Epist. 5, in tom. i. p. 794,) who styles
him the Solon, the Amphion, of the Barbarians, addresses this imaginary
king in the tone of friendship and equality. From such offices of
arbitration, the crafty Dejoces had raised himself to the throne of the
Medes, (Herodot. l. i. c. 96-100.)]

[Footnote 17: Campum sibi praeparari jussit. M. Biet (p. 226-251) has
diligently ascertained this field of battle, at Nogent, a Benedictine
abbey, about ten miles to the north of Soissons. The ground was marked
by a circle of Pagan sepulchres; and Clovis bestowed the adjacent lands
of Leully and Coucy on the church of Rheims.]

[Footnote 18: See Caesar. Comment. de Bell. Gallic. ii. 4, in tom. i.
p. 220, and the Notitiae, tom. i. p. 126. The three Fabricae of Soissons
were, Seutaria, Balistaria, and Clinabaria. The last supplied the
complete armor of the heavy cuirassiers.]

[Footnote 19: The epithet must be confined to the circumstances; and
history cannot justify the French prejudice of Gregory, (l. ii. c. 27,
in tom. ii. p. 175,) ut Gothorum pavere mos est.]

[Footnote 20: Dubos has satisfied me (tom. i. p. 277-286) that Gregory
of Tours, his transcribers, or his readers, have repeatedly confounded
the German kingdom of Thuringia, beyond the Rhine, and the Gallic city
of Tongria, on the Meuse, which was more anciently the country of the
Eburones, and more recently the diocese of Liege.]

The name of the Alemanni has been absurdly derived from their imaginary
settlement on the banks of the Leman Lake. [21] That fortunate district,
from the lake to the Avenche, and Mount Jura, was occupied by the
Burgundians. [22] The northern parts of Helvetia had indeed been subdued
by the ferocious Alemanni, who destroyed with their own hands the fruits
of their conquest. A province, improved and adorned by the arts of
Rome, was again reduced to a savage wilderness; and some vestige of the
stately Vindonissa may still be discovered in the fertile and populous
valley of the Aar. [23] From the source of the Rhine to its conflux
with the Mein and the Moselle, the formidable swarms of the Alemanni
commanded either side of the river, by the right of ancient possession,
or recent victory. They had spread themselves into Gaul, over the modern
provinces of Alsace and Lorraine; and their bold invasion of the kingdom
of Cologne summoned the Salic prince to the defence of his Ripuarian
allies.

Clovis encountered the invaders of Gaul in the plain of Tolbiac, about
twenty-four miles from Cologne; and the two fiercest nations of Germany
were mutually animated by the memory of past exploits, and the prospect
of future greatness. The Franks, after an obstinate struggle, gave way;
and the Alemanni, raising a shout of victory, impetuously pressed their
retreat. But the battle was restored by the valor, and the conduct, and
perhaps by the piety, of Clovis; and the event of the bloody day decided
forever the alternative of empire or servitude. The last king of the
Alemanni was slain in the field, and his people were slaughtered or
pursued, till they threw down their arms, and yielded to the mercy of
the conqueror. Without discipline it was impossible for them to rally:
they had contemptuously demolished the walls and fortifications which
might have protected their distress; and they were followed into the
heart of their forests by an enemy not less active, or intrepid, than
themselves. The great Theodoric congratulated the victory of Clovis,
whose sister Albofleda the king of Italy had lately married; but he
mildly interceded with his brother in favor of the suppliants and
fugitives, who had implored his protection. The Gallic territories,
which were possessed by the Alemanni, became the prize of their
conqueror; and the haughty nation, invincible, or rebellious, to the
arms of Rome, acknowledged the sovereignty of the Merovingian kings,
who graciously permitted them to enjoy their peculiar manners and
institutions, under the government of official, and, at length, of
hereditary, dukes. After the conquest of the Western provinces, the
Franks alone maintained their ancient habitations beyond the Rhine. They
gradually subdued, and civilized, the exhausted countries, as far as the
Elbe, and the mountains of Bohemia; and the peace of Europe was secured
by the obedience of Germany. [24]

[Footnote 21: Populi habitantes juxta Lemannum lacum, Alemanni dicuntur.
Servius, ad Virgil. Georgic. iv. 278. Don Bouquet (tom. i. p. 817) has
only alleged the more recent and corrupt text of Isidore of Seville.]

[Footnote 22: Gregory of Tours sends St. Lupicinus inter illa Jurensis
deserti secreta, quae, inter Burgundiam Alamanniamque sita, Aventicae
adja cent civitati, in tom. i. p. 648. M. de Watteville (Hist. de la
Confederation Helvetique, tom. i. p. 9, 10) has accurately defined
the Helvetian limits of the Duchy of Alemannia, and the Transjurane
Burgundy. They were commensurate with the dioceses of Constance
and Avenche, or Lausanne, and are still discriminated, in modern
Switzerland, by the use of the German, or French, language.]

[Footnote 23: See Guilliman de Rebus Helveticis, l i. c. 3, p. 11, 12.
Within the ancient walls of Vindonissa, the castle of Hapsburgh, the
abbey of Konigsfield, and the town of Bruck, have successively risen.
The philosophic traveller may compare the monuments of Roman conquest of
feudal or Austrian tyranny, of monkish superstition, and of industrious
freedom. If he be truly a philosopher, he will applaud the merit and
happiness of his own times.]

[Footnote 24: Gregory of Tours, (l. ii. 30, 37, in tom. ii. p. 176,
177, 182,) the Gesta Francorum, (in tom. ii. p. 551,) and the epistle
of Theodoric, (Cassiodor. Variar. l. ii. c. 41, in tom. iv. p. 4,)
represent the defeat of the Alemanni. Some of their tribes settled in
Rhaetia, under the protection of Theodoric; whose successors ceded the
colony and their country to the grandson of Clovis. The state of the
Alemanni under the Merovingian kings may be seen in Mascou (Hist. of the
Ancient Germans, xi. 8, &c. Annotation xxxvi.) and Guilliman, (de Reb.
Helvet. l. ii. c. 10-12, p. 72-80.)]

Till the thirtieth year of his age, Clovis continued to worship the
gods of his ancestors. [25] His disbelief, or rather disregard, of
Christianity, might encourage him to pillage with less remorse the
churches of a hostile territory: but his subjects of Gaul enjoyed the
free exercise of religious worship; and the bishops entertained a more
favorable hope of the idolater, than of the heretics. The Merovingian
prince had contracted a fortunate alliance with the fair Clotilda, the
niece of the king of Burgundy, who, in the midst of an Arian court, was
educated in the profession of the Catholic faith. It was her interest,
as well as her duty, to achieve the conversion [26] of a Pagan husband;
and Clovis insensibly listened to the voice of love and religion. He
consented (perhaps such terms had been previously stipulated) to the
baptism of his eldest son; and though the sudden death of the infant
excited some superstitious fears, he was persuaded, a second time,
to repeat the dangerous experiment. In the distress of the battle of
Tolbiac, Clovis loudly invoked the God of Clotilda and the Christians;
and victory disposed him to hear, with respectful gratitude, the
eloquent [27] Remigius, [28] bishop of Rheims, who forcibly displayed
the temporal and spiritual advantages of his conversion. The king
declared himself satisfied of the truth of the Catholic faith; and the
political reasons which might have suspended his public profession, were
removed by the devout or loyal acclamations of the Franks, who showed
themselves alike prepared to follow their heroic leader to the field of
battle, or to the baptismal font. The important ceremony was performed
in the cathedral of Rheims, with every circumstance of magnificence and
solemnity that could impress an awful sense of religion on the minds of
its rude proselytes. [29] The new Constantine was immediately baptized,
with three thousand of his warlike subjects; and their example was
imitated by the remainder of the gentle Barbarians, who, in obedience to
the victorious prelate, adored the cross which they had burnt, and burnt
the idols which they had formerly adored. [30] The mind of Clovis was
susceptible of transient fervor: he was exasperated by the pathetic
tale of the passion and death of Christ; and, instead of weighing the
salutary consequences of that mysterious sacrifice, he exclaimed, with
indiscreet fury, "Had I been present at the head of my valiant Franks, I
would have revenged his injuries." [31] But the savage conqueror of Gaul
was incapable of examining the proofs of a religion, which depends
on the laborious investigation of historic evidence and speculative
theology. He was still more incapable of feeling the mild influence of
the gospel, which persuades and purifies the heart of a genuine convert.
His ambitious reign was a perpetual violation of moral and Christian
duties: his hands were stained with blood in peace as well as in war;
and, as soon as Clovis had dismissed a synod of the Gallican church, he
calmly assassinated all the princes of the Merovingian race. [32] Yet
the king of the Franks might sincerely worship the Christian God, as
a Being more excellent and powerful than his national deities; and the
signal deliverance and victory of Tolbiac encouraged Clovis to confide
in the future protection of the Lord of Hosts. Martin, the most popular
of the saints, had filled the Western world with the fame of those
miracles which were incessantly performed at his holy sepulchre of
Tours. His visible or invisible aid promoted the cause of a liberal
and orthodox prince; and the profane remark of Clovis himself, that
St.Martin was an expensive friend, [33] need not be interpreted as the
symptom of any permanent or rational scepticism. But earth, as well as
heaven, rejoiced in the conversion of the Franks. On the memorable day
when Clovis ascended from the baptismal font, he alone, in the Christian
world, deserved the name and prerogatives of a Catholic king. The
emperor Anastasius entertained some dangerous errors concerning the
nature of the divine incarnation; and the Barbarians of Italy, Africa,
Spain, and Gaul, were involved in the Arian heresy. The eldest, or
rather the only, son of the church, was acknowledged by the clergy as
their lawful sovereign, or glorious deliverer; and the armies of Clovis
were strenuously supported by the zeal and fervor of the Catholic
faction. [34]

[Footnote 25: Clotilda, or rather Gregory, supposes that Clovis
worshipped the gods of Greece and Rome. The fact is incredible, and the
mistake only shows how completely, in less than a century, the national
religion of the Franks had been abolished and even forgotten]

[Footnote 26: Gregory of Tours relates the marriage and conversion of
Clovis, (l. ii. c. 28-31, in tom. ii. p. 175-178.) Even Fredegarius,
or the nameless Epitomizer, (in tom. ii. p. 398-400,) the author of the
Gesta Francorum, (in tom. ii. p. 548-552,) and Aimoin himself, (l. i.
c. 13, in tom. iii. p. 37-40,) may be heard without disdain. Tradition
might long preserve some curious circumstances of these important
transactions.]

[Footnote 27: A traveller, who returned from Rheims to Auvergne, had
stolen a copy of his declamations from the secretary or bookseller
of the modest archbishop, (Sidonius Apollinar. l. ix. epist. 7.) Four
epistles of Remigius, which are still extant, (in tom. iv. p. 51, 52,
53,) do not correspond with the splendid praise of Sidonius.]

[Footnote 28: Hincmar, one of the successors of Remigius, (A.D. 845-882,)
had composed his life, (in tom. iii. p. 373-380.) The authority of
ancient MSS. of the church of Rheims might inspire some confidence,
which is destroyed, however, by the selfish and audacious fictions of
Hincmar. It is remarkable enough, that Remigius, who was consecrated
at the age of twenty-two, (A.D. 457,) filled the episcopal chair
seventy-four years, (Pagi Critica, in Baron tom. ii. p. 384, 572.)]

[Footnote 29: A phial (the Sainte Ampoulle of holy, or rather celestial,
oil,) was brought down by a white dove, for the baptism of Clovis; and
it is still used and renewed, in the coronation of the kings of France.
Hincmar (he aspired to the primacy of Gaul) is the first author of
this fable, (in tom. iii. p. 377,) whose slight foundations the Abbe de
Vertot (Memoires de l'Academie des Inscriptions, tom. ii. p. 619-633)
has undermined, with profound respect and consummate dexterity.]

[Footnote 30: Mitis depone colla, Sicamber: adora quod incendisti,
incende quod adorasti. Greg. Turon. l. ii. c. 31, in tom. ii. p. 177.]

[Footnote 31: Si ego ibidem cum Francis meis fuissem, injurias
ejus vindicassem. This rash expression, which Gregory has prudently
concealed, is celebrated by Fredegarius, (Epitom. c. 21, in tom. ii. p.
400,) Ai moin, (l. i. c. 16, in tom. iii. p. 40,) and the Chroniques de
St. Denys, (l. i. c. 20, in tom. iii. p. 171,) as an admirable effusion
of Christian zeal.]

[Footnote 32: Gregory, (l. ii. c. 40-43, in tom. ii. p. 183-185,) after
coolly relating the repeated crimes, and affected remorse, of Clovis,
concludes, perhaps undesignedly, with a lesson, which ambition will never
hear. "His ita transactis obiit."]

[Footnote 33: After the Gothic victory, Clovis made rich offerings to
St. Martin of Tours. He wished to redeem his war-horse by the gift of
one hundred pieces of gold, but the enchanted steed could not remove
from the stable till the price of his redemption had been doubled. This
miracle provoked the king to exclaim, Vere B. Martinus est bonus in
auxilio, sed carus in negotio. (Gesta Francorum, in tom. ii. p. 554,
555.)]

[Footnote 34: See the epistle from Pope Anastasius to the royal convert,
(in Com. iv. p. 50, 51.) Avitus, bishop of Vienna, addressed Clovis on
the same subject, (p. 49;) and many of the Latin bishops would assure
him of their joy and attachment.]

Under the Roman empire, the wealth and jurisdiction of the bishops,
their sacred character, and perpetual office, their numerous dependants,
popular eloquence, and provincial assemblies, had rendered them always
respectable, and sometimes dangerous. Their influence was augmented
with the progress of superstition; and the establishment of the French
monarchy may, in some degree, be ascribed to the firm alliance of a
hundred prelates, who reigned in the discontented, or independent,
cities of Gaul. The slight foundations of the Armorican republic had
been repeatedly shaken, or overthrown; but the same people still guarded
their domestic freedom; asserted the dignity of the Roman name; and
bravely resisted the predatory inroads, and regular attacks, of Clovis,
who labored to extend his conquests from the Seine to the Loire. Their
successful opposition introduced an equal and honorable union. The
Franks esteemed the valor of the Armoricans [35] and the Armoricans were
reconciled by the religion of the Franks. The military force which
had been stationed for the defence of Gaul, consisted of one hundred
different bands of cavalry or infantry; and these troops, while they
assumed the title and privileges of Roman soldiers, were renewed by an
incessant supply of the Barbarian youth. The extreme fortifications, and
scattered fragments of the empire, were still defended by their hopeless
courage. But their retreat was intercepted, and their communication
was impracticable: they were abandoned by the Greek princes of
Constantinople, and they piously disclaimed all connection with the
Arian usurpers of Gaul. They accepted, without shame or reluctance, the
generous capitulation, which was proposed by a Catholic hero; and this
spurious, or legitimate, progeny of the Roman legions, was distinguished
in the succeeding age by their arms, their ensigns, and their peculiar
dress and institutions. But the national strength was increased by these
powerful and voluntary accessions; and the neighboring kingdoms dreaded
the numbers, as well as the spirit, of the Franks. The reduction of the
Northern provinces of Gaul, instead of being decided by the chance of
a single battle, appears to have been slowly effected by the gradual
operation of war and treaty and Clovis acquired each object of his
ambition, by such efforts, or such concessions, as were adequate to its
real value. His savage character, and the virtues of Henry IV., suggest
the most opposite ideas of human nature; yet some resemblance may be
found in the situation of two princes, who conquered France by their
valor, their policy, and the merits of a seasonable conversion. [36]

of Procopious, Hadrian de Valois has restored the proper name of
the easy correction has been almost universally approved. Yet an
unprejudiced reader would naturally suppose, that Procopius means
to describe a tribe of Germans in the alliance of Rome; and not a
confederacy of Gallic cities, which had revolted from the empire. *

[Footnote 36: This important digression of Procopius (de Bell. Gothic.
l. i. c. 12, in tom. ii. p. 29-36) illustrates the origin of the French
monarchy. Yet I must observe, 1. That the Greek historian betrays
an inexcusable ignorance of the geography of the West. 2. That these
treaties and privileges, which should leave some lasting traces, are
totally invisible in Gregory of Tours, the Salic laws, &c.]

The kingdom of the Burgundians, which was defined by the course of two
Gallic rivers, the Saone and the Rhone, extended from the forest of
Vosges to the Alps and the sea of Marscilles. [37] The sceptre was in
the hands of Gundobald. That valiant and ambitious prince had reduced
the number of royal candidates by the death of two brothers, one of
whom was the father of Clotilda; [38] but his imperfect prudence still
permitted Godegesil, the youngest of his brothers, to possess the
dependent principality of Geneva. The Arian monarch was justly alarmed
by the satisfaction, and the hopes, which seemed to animate his clergy
and people after the conversion of Clovis; and Gundobald convened at
Lyons an assembly of his bishops, to reconcile, if it were possible,
their religious and political discontents. A vain conference was
agitated between the two factions. The Arians upbraided the Catholics
with the worship of three Gods: the Catholics defended their cause
by theological distinctions; and the usual arguments, objections, and
replies were reverberated with obstinate clamor; till the king revealed
his secret apprehensions, by an abrupt but decisive question, which he
addressed to the orthodox bishops. "If you truly profess the Christian
religion, why do you not restrain the king of the Franks? He has
declared war against me, and forms alliances with my enemies for my
destruction. A sanguinary and covetous mind is not the symptom of a
sincere conversion: let him show his faith by his works." The answer
of Avitus, bishop of Vienna, who spoke in the name of his brethren, was
delivered with the voice and countenance of an angel. "We are ignorant
of the motives and intentions of the king of the Franks: but we are
taught by Scripture, that the kingdoms which abandon the divine law are
frequently subverted; and that enemies will arise on every side against
those who have made God their enemy. Return, with thy people, to the law
of God, and he will give peace and security to thy dominions." The king
of Burgundy, who was not prepared to accept the condition which the
Catholics considered as essential to the treaty, delayed and dismissed
the ecclesiastical conference; after reproaching his bishops, that
Clovis, their friend and proselyte, had privately tempted the allegiance
of his brother. [39]

[Footnote 37: Regnum circa Rhodanum aut Ararim cum provincia Massiliensi
retinebant. Greg. Turon. l. ii. c. 32, in tom. ii. p. 178. The province
of Marseilles, as far as the Durance, was afterwards ceded to the
Ostrogoths; and the signatures of twenty-five bishops are supposed to
represent the kingdom of Burgundy, A.D. 519. (Concil. Epaon, in tom. iv.
p. 104, 105.) Yet I would except Vindonissa. The bishop, who lived under
the Pagan Alemanni, would naturally resort to the synods of the next
Christian kingdom. Mascou (in his four first annotations) has explained
many circumstances relative to the Burgundian monarchy.]

[Footnote 38: Mascou, (Hist. of the Germans, xi. 10,) who very
reasonably distracts the testimony of Gregory of Tours, has produced
a passage from Avitus (epist. v.) to prove that Gundobald affected to
deplore the tragic event, which his subjects affected to applaud.]

[Footnote 39: See the original conference, (in tom. iv. p. 99-102.)
Avitus, the principal actor, and probably the secretary of the meeting,
was bishop of Vienna. A short account of his person and works may be
fouud in Dupin, (Bibliotheque Ecclesiastique, tom. v. p. 5-10.)]
