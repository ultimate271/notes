## Chapter XXXVII: Conversion Of The Barbarians To Christianity.--Part II.

Pleasure and guilt are synonymous terms in the language of the monks,
and they discovered, by experience, that rigid fasts, and abstemious
diet, are the most effectual preservatives against the impure desires
of the flesh. [44] The rules of abstinence which they imposed, or
practised, were not uniform or perpetual: the cheerful festival of the
Pentecost was balanced by the extraordinary mortification of Lent; the
fervor of new monasteries was insensibly relaxed; and the voracious
appetite of the Gauls could not imitate the patient and temperate
virtue of the Egyptians. [45] The disciples of Antony and Pachomius were
satisfied with their daily pittance, [46] of twelve ounces of bread, or
rather biscuit, [47] which they divided into two frugal repasts, of
the afternoon and of the evening. It was esteemed a merit, and almost a
duty, to abstain from the boiled vegetables which were provided for the
refectory; but the extraordinary bounty of the abbot sometimes indulged
them with the luxury of cheese, fruit, salad, and the small dried
fish of the Nile. [48] A more ample latitude of sea and river fish was
gradually allowed or assumed; but the use of flesh was long confined
to the sick or travellers; and when it gradually prevailed in the less
rigid monasteries of Europe, a singular distinction was introduced;
as if birds, whether wild or domestic, had been less profane than the
grosser animals of the field. Water was the pure and innocent beverage
of the primitive monks; and the founder of the Benedictines regrets the
daily portion of half a pint of wine, which had been extorted from him
by the intemperance of the age. [49] Such an allowance might be easily
supplied by the vineyards of Italy; and his victorious disciples, who
passed the Alps, the Rhine, and the Baltic, required, in the place of
wine, an adequate compensation of strong beer or cider.

[Footnote 44: St. Jerom, in strong, but indiscreet, language, expresses
the most important use of fasting and abstinence: "Non quod Deus
universitatis Creator et Dominus, intestinorum nostrorum rugitu, et
inanitate ventris, pulmonisque ardore delectetur, sed quod aliter
pudicitia tuta esse non possit." (Op. tom. i. p. 32, ad Eustochium.) See
the twelfth and twenty-second Collations of Cassian, de Castitate and de
Illusionibus Nocturnis.]

[Footnote 45: Edacitas in Graecis gula est, in Gallis natura, (Dialog.
i. c. 4 p. 521.) Cassian fairly owns, that the perfect model of
abstinence cannot be imitated in Gaul, on account of the aerum
temperies, and the qualitas nostrae fragilitatis, (Institut. iv. 11.)
Among the Western rules, that of Columbanus is the most austere; he
had been educated amidst the poverty of Ireland, as rigid, perhaps, and
inflexible as the abstemious virtue of Egypt. The rule of Isidore of
Seville is the mildest; on holidays he allows the use of flesh.]

[Footnote 46: "Those who drink only water, and have no nutritious
liquor, ought, at least, to have a pound and a half (twenty-four ounces)
of bread every day." State of Prisons, p. 40, by Mr. Howard.]

[Footnote 47: See Cassian. Collat. l. ii. 19-21. The small loaves,
or biscuit, of six ounces each, had obtained the name of Paximacia,
(Rosweyde, Onomasticon, p. 1045.) Pachomius, however, allowed his monks
some latitude in the quantity of their food; but he made them work in
proportion as they ate, (Pallad. in Hist. Lausiac. c. 38, 39, in Vit.
Patrum, l. viii. p. 736, 737.)]

[Footnote 48: See the banquet to which Cassian (Collation viii. 1) was
invited by Serenus, an Egyptian abbot.]

[Footnote 49: See the Rule of St. Benedict, No. 39, 40, (in Cod. Reg.
part ii. p. 41, 42.) Licet legamus vinum omnino monachorum non esse,
sed quia nostris temporibus id monachis persuaderi non potest; he allows
them a Roman hemina, a measure which may be ascertained from Arbuthnot's
Tables.] The candidate who aspired to the virtue of evangelical poverty,
abjured, at his first entrance into a regular community, the idea,
and even the name, of all separate or exclusive possessions. [50] The
brethren were supported by their manual labor; and the duty of labor was
strenuously recommended as a penance, as an exercise, and as the most
laudable means of securing their daily subsistence. [51] The garden
and fields, which the industry of the monks had often rescued from the
forest or the morass, were diligently cultivated by their hands.
They performed, without reluctance, the menial offices of slaves and
domestics; and the several trades that were necessary to provide their
habits, their utensils, and their lodging, were exercised within the
precincts of the great monasteries. The monastic studies have tended,
for the most part, to darken, rather than to dispel, the cloud of
superstition. Yet the curiosity or zeal of some learned solitaries
has cultivated the ecclesiastical, and even the profane, sciences; and
posterity must gratefully acknowledge, that the monuments of Greek
and Roman literature have been preserved and multiplied by their
indefatigable pens. [52] But the more humble industry of the monks,
especially in Egypt, was contented with the silent, sedentary occupation
of making wooden sandals, or of twisting the leaves of the palm-tree
into mats and baskets. The superfluous stock, which was not consumed in
domestic use, supplied, by trade, the wants of the community: the boats
of Tabenne, and the other monasteries of Thebais, descended the Nile
as far as Alexandria; and, in a Christian market, the sanctity of the
workmen might enhance the intrinsic value of the work.

[Footnote 50: Such expressions as my book, my cloak, my shoes, (Cassian
Institut. l. iv. c. 13,) were not less severely prohibited among the
Western monks, (Cod. Regul. part ii. p. 174, 235, 288;) and the rule
of Columbanus punished them with six lashes. The ironical author of the
Ordres Monastiques, who laughs at the foolish nicety of modern convents,
seems ignorant that the ancients were equally absurd.]

[Footnote 51: Two great masters of ecclesiastical science, the P.
Thomassin, (Discipline de l'Eglise, tom. iii. p. 1090-1139,) and the
P. Mabillon, (Etudes Monastiques, tom. i. p. 116-155,) have seriously
examined the manual labor of the monks, which the former considers as a
merit and the latter as a duty.]

[Footnote 52: Mabillon (Etudes Monastiques, tom. i. p. 47-55) has
collected many curious facts to justify the literary labors of his
predecessors, both in the East and West. Books were copied in the
ancient monasteries of Egypt, (Cassian. Institut. l. iv. c. 12,) and
by the disciples of St. Martin, (Sulp. Sever. in Vit. Martin. c. 7,
p. 473.) Cassiodorus has allowed an ample scope for the studies of the
monks; and we shall not be scandalized, if their pens sometimes wandered
from Chrysostom and Augustin to Homer and Virgil.] But the necessity of
manual labor was insensibly superseded.

The novice was tempted to bestow his fortune on the saints, in whose
society he was resolved to spend the remainder of his life; and the
pernicious indulgence of the laws permitted him to receive, for their
use, any future accessions of legacy or inheritance. [53] Melania
contributed her plate, three hundred pounds weight of silver; and Paula
contracted an immense debt, for the relief of their favorite monks; who
kindly imparted the merits of their prayers and penance to a rich and
liberal sinner. [54] Time continually increased, and accidents could
seldom diminish, the estates of the popular monasteries, which spread
over the adjacent country and cities: and, in the first century of their
institution, the infidel Zosimus has maliciously observed, that, for
the benefit of the poor, the Christian monks had reduced a great part
of mankind to a state of beggary. [55] As long as they maintained their
original fervor, they approved themselves, however, the faithful and
benevolent stewards of the charity, which was entrusted to their care.
But their discipline was corrupted by prosperity: they gradually assumed
the pride of wealth, and at last indulged the luxury of expense. Their
public luxury might be excused by the magnificence of religious worship,
and the decent motive of erecting durable habitations for an immortal
society. But every age of the church has accused the licentiousness
of the degenerate monks; who no longer remembered the object of their
institution, embraced the vain and sensual pleasures of the world, which
they had renounced, [56] and scandalously abused the riches which had
been acquired by the austere virtues of their founders. [57] Their
natural descent, from such painful and dangerous virtue, to the common
vices of humanity, will not, perhaps, excite much grief or indignation
in the mind of a philosopher.

[Footnote 53: Thomassin (Discipline de l'Eglise, tom. iii. p. 118,
145, 146, 171-179) has examined the revolution of the civil, canon, and
common law. Modern France confirms the death which monks have inflicted
on themselves, and justly deprives them of all right of inheritance.]

[Footnote 54: See Jerom, (tom. i. p. 176, 183.) The monk Pambo made a
sublime answer to Melania, who wished to specify the value of her
gift: "Do you offer it to me, or to God? If to God, He who suspends
the mountain in a balance, need not be informed of the weight of your
plate." (Pallad. Hist. Lausiac. c. 10, in the Vit. Patrum, l. viii. p.
715.)]

[Footnote 55: Zosim. l. v. p. 325. Yet the wealth of the Eastern monks
was far surpassed by the princely greatness of the Benedictines.]

[Footnote 56: The sixth general council (the Quinisext in Trullo, Canon
xlvii in Beveridge, tom. i. p. 213) restrains women from passing the
night in a male, or men in a female, monastery. The seventh general
council (the second Nicene, Canon xx. in Beveridge, tom. i. p. 325)
prohibits the erection of double or promiscuous monasteries of both
sexes; but it appears from Balsamon, that the prohibition was not
effectual. On the irregular pleasures and expenses of the clergy and
monks, see Thomassin, tom. iii. p. 1334-1368.]

[Footnote 57: I have somewhere heard or read the frank confession of a
Benedictine abbot: "My vow of poverty has given me a hundred thousand
crowns a year; my vow of obedience has raised me to the rank of a
sovereign prince."--I forget the consequences of his vow of chastity.]

The lives of the primitive monks were consumed in penance and solitude;
undisturbed by the various occupations which fill the time, and exercise
the faculties, of reasonable, active, and social beings. Whenever
they were permitted to step beyond the precincts of the monastery, two
jealous companions were the mutual guards and spies of each other's
actions; and, after their return, they were condemned to forget, or,
at least, to suppress, whatever they had seen or heard in the world.
Strangers, who professed the orthodox faith, were hospitably entertained
in a separate apartment; but their dangerous conversation was restricted
to some chosen elders of approved discretion and fidelity. Except in
their presence, the monastic slave might not receive the visits of
his friends or kindred; and it was deemed highly meritorious, if he
afflicted a tender sister, or an aged parent, by the obstinate refusal
of a word or look. [58] The monks themselves passed their lives, without
personal attachments, among a crowd which had been formed by accident,
and was detained, in the same prison, by force or prejudice. Recluse
fanatics have few ideas or sentiments to communicate: a special license
of the abbot regulated the time and duration of their familiar visits;
and, at their silent meals, they were enveloped in their cowls,
inaccessible, and almost invisible, to each other. [59] Study is the
resource of solitude: but education had not prepared and qualified for
any liberal studies the mechanics and peasants who filled the monastic
communities. They might work: but the vanity of spiritual perfection was
tempted to disdain the exercise of manual labor; and the industry must
be faint and languid, which is not excited by the sense of personal
interest.

[Footnote 58: Pior, an Egyptian monk, allowed his sister to see him;
but he shut his eyes during the whole visit. See Vit. Patrum, l. iii. p.
504. Many such examples might be added.]

[Footnote 59: The 7th, 8th, 29th, 30th, 31st, 34th, 57th, 60th, 86th,
and 95th articles of the Rule of Pachomius, impose most intolerable laws
of silence and mortification.]

According to their faith and zeal, they might employ the day, which they
passed in their cells, either in vocal or mental prayer: they assembled
in the evening, and they were awakened in the night, for the public
worship of the monastery. The precise moment was determined by the
stars, which are seldom clouded in the serene sky of Egypt; and a rustic
horn, or trumpet, the signal of devotion, twice interrupted the vast
silence of the desert. [60] Even sleep, the last refuge of the unhappy,
was rigorously measured: the vacant hours of the monk heavily rolled
along, without business or pleasure; and, before the close of each day,
he had repeatedly accused the tedious progress of the sun. [61] In this
comfortless state, superstition still pursued and tormented her wretched
votaries. [62] The repose which they had sought in the cloister was
disturbed by a tardy repentance, profane doubts, and guilty desires;
and, while they considered each natural impulse as an unpardonable sin,
they perpetually trembled on the edge of a flaming and bottomless abyss.
From the painful struggles of disease and despair, these unhappy victims
were sometimes relieved by madness or death; and, in the sixth century,
a hospital was founded at Jerusalem for a small portion of the austere
penitents, who were deprived of their senses. [63] Their visions,
before they attained this extreme and acknowledged term of frenzy, have
afforded ample materials of supernatural history. It was their firm
persuasion, that the air, which they breathed, was peopled with
invisible enemies; with innumerable demons, who watched every occasion,
and assumed every form, to terrify, and above all to tempt, their
unguarded virtue. The imagination, and even the senses, were deceived by
the illusions of distempered fanaticism; and the hermit, whose midnight
prayer was oppressed by involuntary slumber, might easily confound the
phantoms of horror or delight, which had occupied his sleeping and his
waking dreams. [64]

[Footnote 60: The diurnal and nocturnal prayers of the monks are
copiously discussed by Cassian, in the third and fourth books of his
Institutions; and he constantly prefers the liturgy, which an angel had
dictated to the monasteries of Tebennoe.]

[Footnote 61: Cassian, from his own experience, describes the acedia,
or listlessness of mind and body, to which a monk was exposed, when he
sighed to find himself alone. Saepiusque egreditur et ingreditur
cellam, et Solem velut ad occasum tardius properantem crebrius intuetur,
(Institut. x. l.)]

[Footnote 62: The temptations and sufferings of Stagirius were
communicated by that unfortunate youth to his friend St. Chrysostom. See
Middleton's Works, vol. i. p. 107-110. Something similar introduces the
life of every saint; and the famous Inigo, or Ignatius, the founder of
the Jesuits, (vide d'Inigo de Guiposcoa, tom. i. p. 29-38,) may serve as
a memorable example.]

[Footnote 63: Fleury, Hist. Ecclesiastique, tom. vii. p. 46. I have
read somewhere, in the Vitae Patrum, but I cannot recover the place
that several, I believe many, of the monks, who did not reveal their
temptations to the abbot, became guilty of suicide.]

[Footnote 64: See the seventh and eighth Collations of Cassian, who
gravely examines, why the demons were grown less active and numerous
since the time of St. Antony. Rosweyde's copious index to the Vitae
Patrum will point out a variety of infernal scenes. The devils were most
formidable in a female shape.]

The monks were divided into two classes: the Coenobites, who lived under
a common and regular discipline; and the Anachorets, who indulged their
unsocial, independent fanaticism. [65] The most devout, or the most
ambitious, of the spiritual brethren, renounced the convent, as they had
renounced the world. The fervent monasteries of Egypt, Palestine, and
Syria, were surrounded by a Laura, [66] a distant circle of solitary
cells; and the extravagant penance of Hermits was stimulated by applause
and emulation. [67] They sunk under the painful weight of crosses and
chains; and their emaciated limbs were confined by collars, bracelets,
gauntlets, and greaves of massy and rigid iron. All superfluous
encumbrance of dress they contemptuously cast away; and some savage
saints of both sexes have been admired, whose naked bodies were only
covered by their long hair. They aspired to reduce themselves to
the rude and miserable state in which the human brute is scarcely
distinguishable above his kindred animals; and the numerous sect of
Anachorets derived their name from their humble practice of grazing in
the fields of Mesopotamia with the common herd. [68] They often usurped
the den of some wild beast whom they affected to resemble; they buried
themselves in some gloomy cavern, which art or nature had scooped out
of the rock; and the marble quarries of Thebais are still inscribed
with the monuments of their penance. [69] The most perfect Hermits are
supposed to have passed many days without food, many nights without
sleep, and many years without speaking; and glorious was the man (
I abuse that name) who contrived any cell, or seat, of a peculiar
construction, which might expose him, in the most inconvenient posture,
to the inclemency of the seasons.

[Footnote 65: For the distinction of the Coenobites and the Hermits,
especially in Egypt, see Jerom, (tom. i. p. 45, ad Rusticum,) the first
Dialogue of Sulpicius Severus, Rufinus, (c. 22, in Vit. Patrum, l. ii.
p. 478,) Palladius, (c. 7, 69, in Vit. Patrum, l. viii. p. 712, 758,)
and, above all, the eighteenth and nineteenth Collations of Cassian.
These writers, who compare the common and solitary life, reveal the
abuse and danger of the latter.]

[Footnote 66: Suicer. Thesaur. Ecclesiast. tom. ii. p. 205, 218.
Thomassin (Discipline de l'Eglise, tom. i. p. 1501, 1502) gives a good
account of these cells. When Gerasimus founded his monastery in the
wilderness of Jordan, it was accompanied by a Laura of seventy cells.]

[Footnote 67: Theodoret, in a large volume, (the Philotheus in Vit.
Patrum, l. ix. p. 793-863,) has collected the lives and miracles of
thirty Anachorets. Evagrius (l. i. c. 12) more briefly celebrates the
monks and hermits of Palestine.]

[Footnote 68: Sozomen, l. vi. c. 33. The great St. Ephrem composed a
panegyric on these or grazing monks, (Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom. viii.
p. 292.)]

[Footnote 69: The P. Sicard (Missions du Levant, tom. ii. p. 217-233)
examined the caverns of the Lower Thebais with wonder and devotion.
The inscriptions are in the old Syriac character, which was used by the
Christians of Abyssinia.]

Among these heroes of the monastic life, the name and genius of Simeon
Stylites [70] have been immortalized by the singular invention of an
aerial penance. At the age of thirteen, the young Syrian deserted the
profession of a shepherd, and threw himself into an austere monastery.
After a long and painful novitiate, in which Simeon was repeatedly saved
from pious suicide, he established his residence on a mountain, about
thirty or forty miles to the east of Antioch. Within the space of a
mandra, or circle of stones, to which he had attached himself by a
ponderous chain, he ascended a column, which was successively raised
from the height of nine, to that of sixty, feet from the ground. [71] In
this last and lofty station, the Syrian Anachoret resisted the heat
of thirty summers, and the cold of as many winters. Habit and exercise
instructed him to maintain his dangerous situation without fear
or giddiness, and successively to assume the different postures
of devotion. He sometimes prayed in an erect attitude, with his
outstretched arms in the figure of a cross, but his most familiar
practice was that of bending his meagre skeleton from the forehead to
the feet; and a curious spectator, after numbering twelve hundred and
forty-four repetitions, at length desisted from the endless account. The
progress of an ulcer in his thigh [72] might shorten, but it could not
disturb, this celestial life; and the patient Hermit expired, without
descending from his column. A prince, who should capriciously inflict
such tortures, would be deemed a tyrant; but it would surpass the power
of a tyrant to impose a long and miserable existence on the reluctant
victims of his cruelty. This voluntary martyrdom must have gradually
destroyed the sensibility both of the mind and body; nor can it be
presumed that the fanatics, who torment themselves, are susceptible of
any lively affection for the rest of mankind. A cruel, unfeeling temper
has distinguiseed the monks of every age and country: their stern
indifference, which is seldom mollified by personal friendship, is
inflamed by religious hatred; and their merciless zeal has strenuously
administered the holy office of the Inquisition.

[Footnote 70: See Theodoret (in Vit. Patrum, l. ix. p. 848-854,) Antony,
(in Vit. Patrum, l. i. p. 170-177,) Cosmas, (in Asseman. Bibliot.
Oriental tom. i. p. 239-253,) Evagrius, (l. i. c. 13, 14,) and
Tillemont, (Mem. Eccles. tom. xv. p. 347-392.)]

[Footnote 71: The narrow circumference of two cubits, or three feet,
which Evagrius assigns for the summit of the column is inconsistent with
reason, with facts, and with the rules of architecture. The people who
saw it from below might be easily deceived.]

[Footnote 72: I must not conceal a piece of ancient scandal concerning
the origin of this ulcer. It has been reported that the Devil, assuming
an angelic form, invited him to ascend, like Elijah, into a fiery
chariot. The saint too hastily raised his foot, and Satan seized the
moment of inflicting this chastisement on his vanity.]

The monastic saints, who excite only the contempt and pity of a
philosopher, were respected, and almost adored, by the prince and
people. Successive crowds of pilgrims from Gaul and India saluted the
divine pillar of Simeon: the tribes of Saracens disputed in arms the
honor of his benediction; the queens of Arabia and Persia gratefully
confessed his supernatural virtue; and the angelic Hermit was consulted
by the younger Theodosius, in the most important concerns of the church
and state. His remains were transported from the mountain of Telenissa,
by a solemn procession of the patriarch, the master-general of the East,
six bishops, twenty-one counts or tribunes, and six thousand soldiers;
and Antioch revered his bones, as her glorious ornament and impregnable
defence. The fame of the apostles and martyrs was gradually eclipsed by
these recent and popular Anachorets; the Christian world fell prostrate
before their shrines; and the miracles ascribed to their relics
exceeded, at least in number and duration, the spiritual exploits of
their lives. But the golden legend of their lives [73] was embellished
by the artful credulity of their interested brethren; and a believing
age was easily persuaded, that the slightest caprice of an Egyptian or
a Syrian monk had been sufficient to interrupt the eternal laws of the
universe. The favorites of Heaven were accustomed to cure inveterate
diseases with a touch, a word, or a distant message; and to expel the
most obstinate demons from the souls or bodies which they possessed.
They familiarly accosted, or imperiously commanded, the lions and
serpents of the desert; infused vegetation into a sapless trunk;
suspended iron on the surface of the water; passed the Nile on the
back of a crocodile, and refreshed themselves in a fiery furnace. These
extravagant tales, which display the fiction without the genius, of
poetry, have seriously affected the reason, the faith, and the morals,
of the Christians. Their credulity debased and vitiated the faculties
of the mind: they corrupted the evidence of history; and superstition
gradually extinguished the hostile light of philosophy and science.
Every mode of religious worship which had been practised by the saints,
every mysterious doctrine which they believed, was fortified by the
sanction of divine revelation, and all the manly virtues were oppressed
by the servile and pusillanimous reign of the monks. If it be possible
to measure the interval between the philosophic writings of Cicero and
the sacred legend of Theodoret, between the character of Cato and
that of Simeon, we may appreciate the memorable revolution which was
accomplished in the Roman empire within a period of five hundred years.

[Footnote 73: I know not how to select or specify the miracles contained
in the Vitae Patrum of Rosweyde, as the number very much exceeds the
thousand pages of that voluminous work. An elegant specimen may be found
in the dialogues of Sulpicius Severus, and his Life of St. Martin. He
reveres the monks of Egypt; yet he insults them with the remark, that
they never raised the dead; whereas the bishop of Tours had restored
three dead men to life.] II. The progress of Christianity has been
marked by two glorious and decisive victories: over the learned and
luxurious citizens of the Roman empire; and over the warlike Barbarians
of Scythia and Germany, who subverted the empire, and embraced the
religion, of the Romans. The Goths were the foremost of these savage
proselytes; and the nation was indebted for its conversion to a
countryman, or, at least, to a subject, worthy to be ranked among
the inventors of useful arts, who have deserved the remembrance and
gratitude of posterity. A great number of Roman provincials had been led
away into captivity by the Gothic bands, who ravaged Asia in the time
of Gallienus; and of these captives, many were Christians, and several
belonged to the ecclesiastical order. Those involuntary missionaries,
dispersed as slaves in the villages of Dacia, successively labored for
the salvation of their masters. The seeds which they planted, of the
evangelic doctrine, were gradually propagated; and before the end of a
century, the pious work was achieved by the labors of Ulphilas, whose
ancestors had been transported beyond the Danube from a small town of
Cappadocia.

Ulphilas, the bishop and apostle of the Goths, [74] acquired their love
and reverence by his blameless life and indefatigable zeal; and they
received, with implicit confidence, the doctrines of truth and virtue
which he preached and practised. He executed the arduous task of
translating the Scriptures into their native tongue, a dialect of the
German or Teutonic language; but he prudently suppressed the four books
of Kings, as they might tend to irritate the fierce and sanguinary
spirit of the Barbarians. The rude, imperfect idiom of soldiers and
shepherds, so ill qualified to communicate any spiritual ideas, was
improved and modulated by his genius: and Ulphilas, before he could
frame his version, was obliged to compose a new alphabet of twenty-four
letters; [741] four of which he invented, to express the peculiar sounds
that were unknown to the Greek and Latin pronunciation. [75] But the
prosperous state of the Gothic church was soon afflicted by war and
intestine discord, and the chieftains were divided by religion as
well as by interest. Fritigern, the friend of the Romans, became the
proselyte of Ulphilas; while the haughty soul of Athanaric disdained the
yoke of the empire and of the gospel The faith of the new converts was
tried by the persecution which he excited. A wagon, bearing aloft the
shapeless image of Thor, perhaps, or of Woden, was conducted in solemn
procession through the streets of the camp; and the rebels, who refused
to worship the god of their fathers, were immediately burnt, with their
tents and families. The character of Ulphilas recommended him to the
esteem of the Eastern court, where he twice appeared as the minister of
peace; he pleaded the cause of the distressed Goths, who implored
the protection of Valens; and the name of Moses was applied to this
spiritual guide, who conducted his people through the deep waters of
the Danube to the Land of Promise. [76] The devout shepherds, who were
attached to his person, and tractable to his voice, acquiesced in
their settlement, at the foot of the Maesian mountains, in a country
of woodlands and pastures, which supported their flocks and herds,
and enabled them to purchase the corn and wine of the more plentiful
provinces. These harmless Barbarians multiplied in obscure peace and the
profession of Christianity. [77]

[Footnote 74: On the subject of Ulphilas, and the conversion of the
Goths, see Sozomen, l. vi. c. 37. Socrates, l. iv. c. 33. Theodoret, l.
iv. c. 37. Philostorg. l. ii. c. 5. The heresy of Philostorgius appears
to have given him superior means of information.]

[Footnote 741: This is the Moeso-Gothic alphabet of which many of the
letters are evidently formed from the Greek and Roman. M. St. Martin,
however contends, that it is impossible but that some written alphabet
must have been known long before among the Goths. He supposes that
their former letters were those inscribed on the runes, which, being
inseparably connected with the old idolatrous superstitions, were
proscribed by the Christian missionaries. Everywhere the runes, so
common among all the German tribes, disappear after the propagation of
Christianity. S. Martin iv. p. 97, 98.--M.]

[Footnote 75: A mutilated copy of the four Gospels, in the Gothic
version, was published A.D. 1665, and is esteemed the most ancient
monument of the Teutonic language, though Wetstein attempts, by some
frivolous conjectures, to deprive Ulphilas of the honor of the work. Two
of the four additional letters express the W, and our own Th. See Simon,

Codex Argenteus, found in the sixteenth century at Wenden, near Cologne,
and now preserved at Upsal, contains almost the entire four Gospels.
The best edition is that of J. Christ. Zahn, Weissenfels, 1805. In 1762
Knettel discovered and published from a Palimpsest MS. four chapters of
the Epistle to the Romans: they were reprinted at Upsal, 1763. M. Mai
has since that time discovered further fragments, and other remains
of Moeso-Gothic literature, from a Palimpsest at Milan. See Ulphilae
partium inedi arum in Ambrosianis Palimpsestis ab Ang. Maio repertarum
specimen Milan. Ito. 1819.--M.]

reign of Constantine; but I am much inclined to believe that it preceded
the great emigration.]

Their fiercer brethren, the formidable Visigoths, universally adopted
the religion of the Romans, with whom they maintained a perpetual
intercourse, of war, of friendship, or of conquest. In their long and
victorious march from the Danube to the Atlantic Ocean, they converted
their allies; they educated the rising generation; and the devotion
which reigned in the camp of Alaric, or the court of Thoulouse, might
edify or disgrace the palaces of Rome and Constantinople. [78] During
the same period, Christianity was embraced by almost all the Barbarians,
who established their kingdoms on the ruins of the Western empire; the
Burgundians in Gaul, the Suevi in Spain, the Vandals in Africa, the
Ostrogoths in Pannonia, and the various bands of mercenaries, that
raised Odoacer to the throne of Italy. The Franks and the Saxons still
persevered in the errors of Paganism; but the Franks obtained the
monarchy of Gaul by their submission to the example of Clovis; and
the Saxon conquerors of Britain were reclaimed from their savage
superstition by the missionaries of Rome. These Barbarian proselytes
displayed an ardent and successful zeal in the propagation of the faith.
The Merovingian kings, and their successors, Charlemagne and the Othos,
extended, by their laws and victories, the dominion of the cross.
England produced the apostle of Germany; and the evangelic light was
gradually diffused from the neighborhood of the Rhine, to the nations of
the Elbe, the Vistula, and the Baltic. [79]

in the North, from the fourth to the fourteenth century. The subject
would afford materials for an ecclesiastical and even philosophical,
