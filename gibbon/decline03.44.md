## Chapter XXXVIII: Reign Of Clovis.--Part II.

The allegiance of his brother was already seduced; and the obedience of
Godegesil, who joined the royal standard with the troops of Geneva, more
effectually promoted the success of the conspiracy. While the Franks and
Burgundians contended with equal valor, his seasonable desertion decided
the event of the battle; and as Gundobald was faintly supported by
the disaffected Gauls, he yielded to the arms of Clovis, and hastily
retreated from the field, which appears to have been situate between
Langres and Dijon. He distrusted the strength of Dijon, a quadrangular
fortress, encompassed by two rivers, and by a wall thirty feet high,
and fifteen thick, with four gates, and thirty-three towers: [40] he
abandoned to the pursuit of Clovis the important cities of Lyons and
Vienna; and Gundobald still fled with precipitation, till he had reached
Avignon, at the distance of two hundred and fifty miles from the field
of battle.

A long siege and an artful negotiation, admonished the king of the
Franks of the danger and difficulty of his enterprise. He imposed a
tribute on the Burgundian prince, compelled him to pardon and reward his
brother's treachery, and proudly returned to his own dominions, with the
spoils and captives of the southern provinces. This splendid triumph was
soon clouded by the intelligence, that Gundobald had violated his recent
obligations, and that the unfortunate Godegesil, who was left at
Vienna with a garrison of five thousand Franks, [41] had been besieged,
surprised, and massacred by his inhuman brother. Such an outrage might
have exasperated the patience of the most peaceful sovereign; yet the
conqueror of Gaul dissembled the injury, released the tribute, and
accepted the alliance, and military service, of the king of Burgundy.
Clovis no longer possessed those advantages which had assured the
success of the preceding war; and his rival, instructed by adversity,
had found new resources in the affections of his people. The Gauls or
Romans applauded the mild and impartial laws of Gundobald, which almost
raised them to the same level with their conquerors. The bishops were
reconciled, and flattered, by the hopes, which he artfully suggested, of
his approaching conversion; and though he eluded their accomplishment
to the last moment of his life, his moderation secured the peace, and
suspended the ruin, of the kingdom of Burgundy. [42]

[Footnote 40: Gregory of Tours (l. iii. c. 19, in tom. ii. p. 197)
indulges his genius, or rather describes some more eloquent writer, in
the description of Dijon; a castle, which already deserved the title of
a city. It depended on the bishops of Langres till the twelfth century,
and afterwards became the capital of the dukes of Burgundy Longuerue
Description de la France, part i. p. 280.]

[Footnote 41: The Epitomizer of Gregory of Tours (in tom. ii. p. 401)
has supplied this number of Franks; but he rashly supposes that they
were cut in pieces by Gundobald. The prudent Burgundian spared
the soldiers of Clovis, and sent these captives to the king of the
Visigoths, who settled them in the territory of Thoulouse.]

[Footnote 42: In this Burgundian war I have followed Gregory of Tours,
(l. ii. c. 32, 33, in tom. ii. p. 178, 179,) whose narrative appears
so incompatible with that of Procopius, (de Bell. Goth. l. i. c. 12, in
tom. ii. p. 31, 32,) that some critics have supposed two different wars.
The Abbe Dubos (Hist. Critique, &c., tom. ii. p. 126-162) has distinctly
represented the causes and the events.]

I am impatient to pursue the final ruin of that kingdom, which was
accomplished under the reign of Sigismond, the son of Gundobald. The
Catholic Sigismond has acquired the honors of a saint and martyr; [43]
but the hands of the royal saint were stained with the blood of his
innocent son, whom he inhumanly sacrificed to the pride and resentment
of a step-mother. He soon discovered his error, and bewailed the
irreparable loss. While Sigismond embraced the corpse of the unfortunate
youth, he received a severe admonition from one of his attendants:
"It is not his situation, O king! it is thine which deserves pity and
lamentation." The reproaches of a guilty conscience were alleviated,
however, by his liberal donations to the monastery of Agaunum, or
St. Maurice, in Vallais; which he himself had founded in honor of
the imaginary martyrs of the Thebaean legion. [44] A full chorus of
perpetual psalmody was instituted by the pious king; he assiduously
practised the austere devotion of the monks; and it was his humble
prayer, that Heaven would inflict in this world the punishment of his
sins. His prayer was heard: the avengers were at hand: and the provinces
of Burgundy were overwhelmed by an army of victorious Franks. After the
event of an unsuccessful battle, Sigismond, who wished to protract his
life that he might prolong his penance, concealed himself in the
desert in a religious habit, till he was discovered and betrayed by
his subjects, who solicited the favor of their new masters. The captive
monarch, with his wife and two children, was transported to Orleans, and
buried alive in a deep well, by the stern command of the sons of Clovis;
whose cruelty might derive some excuse from the maxims and examples of
their barbarous age. Their ambition, which urged them to achieve the
conquest of Burgundy, was inflamed, or disguised, by filial piety: and
Clotilda, whose sanctity did not consist in the forgiveness of injuries,
pressed them to revenge her father's death on the family of his
assassin. The rebellious Burgundians (for they attempted to break their
chains) were still permitted to enjoy their national laws under the
obligation of tribute and military service; and the Merovingian princes
peaceably reigned over a kingdom, whose glory and greatness had been
first overthrown by the arms of Clovis. [45]

[Footnote 43: See his life or legend, (in tom. iii. p. 402.) A martyr!
how strangely has that word been distorted from its original sense of a
common witness. St. Sigismond was remarkable for the cure of fevers]

[Footnote 44: Before the end of the fifth century, the church of St.
Maurice, and his Thebaean legion, had rendered Agaunum a place of devout
pilgrimage. A promiscuous community of both sexes had introduced some
deeds of darkness, which were abolished (A.D. 515) by the regular
monastery of Sigismond. Within fifty years, his angels of light made
a nocturnal sally to murder their bishop, and his clergy. See in the
Bibliotheque Raisonnee (tom. xxxvi. p. 435-438) the curious remarks of a
learned librarian of Geneva.]

[Footnote 45: Marius, bishop of Avenche, (Chron. in tom. ii. p. 15,) has
marked the authentic dates, and Gregory of Tours (l. iii. c. 5, 6, in
tom. ii. p. 188, 189) has expressed the principal facts, of the life of
Sigismond, and the conquest of Burgundy. Procopius (in tom. ii. p.
34) and Agathias (in tom. ii. p. 49) show their remote and imperfect
knowledge.]

The first victory of Clovis had insulted the honor of the Goths. They
viewed his rapid progress with jealousy and terror; and the youthful
fame of Alaric was oppressed by the more potent genius of his rival.
Some disputes inevitably arose on the edge of their contiguous
dominions; and after the delays of fruitless negotiation, a personal
interview of the two kings was proposed and accepted. The conference of
Clovis and Alaric was held in a small island of the Loire, near Amboise.
They embraced, familiarly conversed, and feasted together; and separated
with the warmest professions of peace and brotherly love. But
their apparent confidence concealed a dark suspicion of hostile and
treacherous designs; and their mutual complaints solicited, eluded, and
disclaimed, a final arbitration. At Paris, which he already considered
as his royal seat, Clovis declared to an assembly of the princes and
warriors, the pretence, and the motive, of a Gothic war. "It grieves me
to see that the Arians still possess the fairest portion of Gaul. Let
us march against them with the aid of God; and, having vanquished the
heretics, we will possess and divide their fertile provinces." [46] The
Franks, who were inspired by hereditary valor and recent zeal, applauded
the generous design of their monarch; expressed their resolution to
conquer or die, since death and conquest would be equally profitable;
and solemnly protested that they would never shave their beards till
victory should absolve them from that inconvenient vow. The enterprise
was promoted by the public or private exhortations of Clotilda. She
reminded her husband how effectually some pious foundation would
propitiate the Deity, and his servants: and the Christian hero, darting
his battle-axe with a skilful and nervous band, "There, (said he,) on
that spot where my Francisca, [47] shall fall, will I erect a church
in honor of the holy apostles." This ostentatious piety confirmed
and justified the attachment of the Catholics, with whom he secretly
corresponded; and their devout wishes were gradually ripened into
a formidable conspiracy. The people of Aquitain were alarmed by the
indiscreet reproaches of their Gothic tyrants, who justly accused them
of preferring the dominion of the Franks: and their zealous adherent
Quintianus, bishop of Rodez, [48] preached more forcibly in his exile
than in his diocese. To resist these foreign and domestic enemies, who
were fortified by the alliance of the Burgundians, Alaric collected
his troops, far more numerous than the military powers of Clovis. The
Visigoths resumed the exercise of arms, which they had neglected in
a long and luxurious peace; [49] a select band of valiant and robust
slaves attended their masters to the field; [50] and the cities of Gaul
were compelled to furnish their doubtful and reluctant aid. Theodoric,
king of the Ostrogoths, who reigned in Italy, had labored to maintain
the tranquillity of Gaul; and he assumed, or affected, for that purpose,
the impartial character of a mediator. But the sagacious monarch dreaded
the rising empire of Clovis, and he was firmly engaged to support the
national and religious cause of the Goths.

[Footnote 46: Gregory of Tours (l. ii. c. 37, in tom. ii. p. 181)
inserts the short but persuasive speech of Clovis. Valde moleste fero,
quod hi Ariani partem teneant Galliarum, (the author of the Gesta
Francorum, in tom. ii. p. 553, adds the precious epithet of optimam,)
camus cum Dei adjutorio, et, superatis eis, redigamus terram in ditionem
nostram.]

[Footnote 47: Tunc rex projecit a se in directum Bipennem suam quod est
Francisca, &c. (Gesta Franc. in tom. ii. p. 554.) The form and use of
this weapon are clearly described by Procopius, (in tom. ii. p. 37.)
Examples of its national appellation in Latin and French may be found in
the Glossary of Ducange, and the large Dictionnaire de Trevoux.]

[Footnote 48: It is singular enough that some important and authentic
facts should be found in a Life of Quintianus, composed in rhyme in the
old Patois of Rouergue, (Dubos, Hist. Critique, &c., tom. ii. p. 179.)]

[Footnote 49: Quamvis fortitudini vestrae confidentiam tribuat
parentum ves trorum innumerabilis multitudo; quamvis Attilam potentem
reminiscamini Visigotharum viribus inclinatum; tamen quia populorum
ferocia corda longa pace mollescunt, cavete subito in alean aleam
mittere, quos constat tantis temporibus exercitia non habere. Such
was the salutary, but fruitless, advice of peace of reason, and of
Theodoric, (Cassiodor. l. iii. ep. 2.)]

[Footnote 50: Montesquieu (Esprit des Loix, l. xv. c. 14) mentions and
approves the law of the Visigoths, (l. ix. tit. 2, in tom. iv. p. 425,)
which obliged all masters to arm, and send, or lead, into the field a
tenth of their slaves.]

The accidental, or artificial, prodigies which adorned the expedition
of Clovis, were accepted by a superstitious age, as the manifest
declaration of the divine favor. He marched from Paris; and as he
proceeded with decent reverence through the holy diocese of Tours, his
anxiety tempted him to consult the shrine of St. Martin, the sanctuary
and the oracle of Gaul. His messengers were instructed to remark the
words of the Psalm which should happen to be chanted at the precise
moment when they entered the church. Those words most fortunately
expressed the valor and victory of the champions of Heaven, and the
application was easily transferred to the new Joshua, the new Gideon,
who went forth to battle against the enemies of the Lord. [51] Orleans
secured to the Franks a bridge on the Loire; but, at the distance
of forty miles from Poitiers, their progress was intercepted by an
extraordinary swell of the River Vigenna or Vienne; and the opposite
banks were covered by the encampment of the Visigoths. Delay must be
always dangerous to Barbarians, who consume the country through which
they march; and had Clovis possessed leisure and materials, it might
have been impracticable to construct a bridge, or to force a passage,
in the face of a superior enemy. But the affectionate peasants who were
impatient to welcome their deliverer, could easily betray some unknown
or unguarded ford: the merit of the discovery was enhanced by the useful
interposition of fraud or fiction; and a white hart, of singular size
and beauty, appeared to guide and animate the march of the Catholic
army. The counsels of the Visigoths were irresolute and distracted.
A crowd of impatient warriors, presumptuous in their strength, and
disdaining to fly before the robbers of Germany, excited Alaric to
assert in arms the name and blood of the conquerors of Rome. The advice
of the graver chieftains pressed him to elude the first ardor of the
Franks; and to expect, in the southern provinces of Gaul, the veteran
and victorious Ostrogoths, whom the king of Italy had already sent to
his assistance. The decisive moments were wasted in idle deliberation
the Goths too hastily abandoned, perhaps, an advantageous post; and the
opportunity of a secure retreat was lost by their slow and disorderly
motions. After Clovis had passed the ford, as it is still named, of the
Hart, he advanced with bold and hasty steps to prevent the escape of the
enemy. His nocturnal march was directed by a flaming meteor, suspended
in the air above the cathedral of Poitiers; and this signal, which might
be previously concerted with the orthodox successor of St. Hilary, was
compared to the column of fire that guided the Israelites in the desert.
At the third hour of the day, about ten miles beyond Poitiers, Clovis
overtook, and instantly attacked, the Gothic army; whose defeat was
already prepared by terror and confusion. Yet they rallied in their
extreme distress, and the martial youths, who had clamorously demanded
the battle, refused to survive the ignominy of flight. The two kings
encountered each other in single combat. Alaric fell by the hand of
his rival; and the victorious Frank was saved by the goodness of his
cuirass, and the vigor of his horse, from the spears of two desperate
Goths, who furiously rode against him to revenge the death of their
sovereign. The vague expression of a mountain of the slain, serves to
indicate a cruel though indefinite slaughter; but Gregory has carefully
observed, that his valiant countryman Apollinaris, the son of Sidonius,
lost his life at the head of the nobles of Auvergne. Perhaps these
suspected Catholics had been maliciously exposed to the blind assault
of the enemy; and perhaps the influence of religion was superseded by
personal attachment or military honor. [52]

[Footnote 51: This mode of divination, by accepting as an omen the first
sacred words, which in particular circumstances should be presented to
the eye or ear, was derived from the Pagans; and the Psalter, or Bible,
was substituted to the poems of Homer and Virgil. From the fourth to
the fourteenth century, these sortes sanctorum, as they are styled,
were repeatedly condemned by the decrees of councils, and repeatedly
practised by kings, bishops, and saints. See a curious dissertation of
the Abbe du Resnel, in the Memoires de l'Academie, tom. xix. p. 287-310]

[Footnote 52: After correcting the text, or excusing the mistake, of
Procopius, who places the defeat of Alaric near Carcassone, we may
conclude, from the evidence of Gregory, Fortunatus, and the author of
the Gesta Francorum, that the battle was fought in campo Vocladensi, on
the banks of the Clain, about ten miles to the south of Poitiers. Clovis
overtook and attacked the Visigoths near Vivonne, and the victory
was decided near a village still named Champagne St. Hilaire. See the
Dissertations of the Abbe le Boeuf, tom. i. p. 304-331.]

Such is the empire of Fortune, (if we may still disguise our ignorance
under that popular name,) that it is almost equally difficult to foresee
the events of war, or to explain their various consequences. A bloody
and complete victory has sometimes yielded no more than the possession
of the field and the loss of ten thousand men has sometimes been
sufficient to destroy, in a single day, the work of ages. The decisive
battle of Poitiers was followed by the conquest of Aquitain. Alaric had
left behind him an infant son, a bastard competitor, factious nobles,
and a disloyal people; and the remaining forces of the Goths were
oppressed by the general consternation, or opposed to each other in
civil discord. The victorious king of the Franks proceeded without delay
to the siege of Angouleme. At the sound of his trumpets the walls of the
city imitated the example of Jericho, and instantly fell to the ground;
a splendid miracle, which may be reduced to the supposition, that
some clerical engineers had secretly undermined the foundations of
the rampart. [53] At Bordeaux, which had submitted without resistance,
Clovis established his winter quarters; and his prudent economy
transported from Thoulouse the royal treasures, which were deposited
in the capital of the monarchy. The conqueror penetrated as far as the
confines of Spain; [54] restored the honors of the Catholic church;
fixed in Aquitain a colony of Franks; [55] and delegated to his
lieutenants the easy task of subduing, or extirpating, the nation of
the Visigoths. But the Visigoths were protected by the wise and powerful
monarch of Italy. While the balance was still equal, Theodoric had
perhaps delayed the march of the Ostrogoths; but their strenuous efforts
successfully resisted the ambition of Clovis; and the army of the
Franks, and their Burgundian allies, was compelled to raise the siege
of Arles, with the loss, as it is said, of thirty thousand men. These
vicissitudes inclined the fierce spirit of Clovis to acquiesce in an
advantageous treaty of peace. The Visigoths were suffered to retain the
possession of Septimania, a narrow tract of sea-coast, from the Rhone to
the Pyrenees; but the ample province of Aquitain, from those mountains
to the Loire, was indissolubly united to the kingdom of France. [56]

[Footnote 53: Angouleme is in the road from Poitiers to Bordeaux; and
although Gregory delays the siege, I can more readily believe that he
confounded the order of history, than that Clovis neglected the rules of
war.]

[Footnote 54: Pyrenaeos montes usque Perpinianum subjecit, is the
expression of Rorico, which betrays his recent date; since Perpignan
did not exist before the tenth century, (Marca Hispanica, p. 458.) This
florid and fabulous writer (perhaps a monk of Amiens--see the Abbe
le Boeuf, Mem. de l'Academie, tom. xvii. p. 228-245) relates, in
the allegorical character of a shepherd, the general history of his
countrymen the Franks; but his narrative ends with the death of Clovis.]

[Footnote 55: The author of the Gesta Francorum positively affirms, that
Clovis fixed a body of Franks in the Saintonge and Bourdelois: and he
is not injudiciously followed by Rorico, electos milites, atque
fortissimos, cum parvulis, atque mulieribus. Yet it should seem
that they soon mingled with the Romans of Aquitain, till Charlemagne
introduced a more numerous and powerful colony, (Dubos, Hist. Critique,
tom. ii. p. 215.)]

[Footnote 56: In the composition of the Gothic war, I have used the
following materials, with due regard to their unequal value. Four
epistles from Theodoric, king of Italy, (Cassiodor l. iii. epist. 1-4.
in tom. iv p. 3-5;) Procopius, (de Bell. Goth. l. i. c 12, in tom. ii.
p. 32, 33;) Gregory of Tours, (l. ii. c. 35, 36, 37, in tom. ii. p.
181-183;) Jornandes, (de Reb. Geticis, c. 58, in tom. ii. p. 28;)
Fortunatas, (in Vit. St. Hilarii, in tom. iii. p. 380;) Isidore, (in
Chron. Goth. in tom. ii. p. 702;) the Epitome of Gregory of Tours, (in
tom. ii. p. 401;) the author of the Gesta Francorum, (in tom. ii. p.
553-555;) the Fragments of Fredegarius, (in tom. ii. p. 463;) Aimoin,
(l. i. c. 20, in tom. iii. p. 41, 42,) and Rorico, (l. iv. in tom. iii.
p. 14-19.)]

After the success of the Gothic war, Clovis accepted the honors of the
Roman consulship. The emperor Anastasius ambitiously bestowed on the
most powerful rival of Theodoric the title and ensigns of that eminent
dignity; yet, from some unknown cause, the name of Clovis has not been
inscribed in the Fasti either of the East or West. [57] On the solemn
day, the monarch of Gaul, placing a diadem on his head, was invested, in
the church of St. Martin, with a purple tunic and mantle. From thence
he proceeded on horseback to the cathedral of Tours; and, as he passed
through the streets, profusely scattered, with his own hand, a donative
of gold and silver to the joyful multitude, who incessantly repeated
their acclamations of Consul and Augustus. The actual or legal authority
of Clovis could not receive any new accessions from the consular
dignity. It was a name, a shadow, an empty pageant; and if the conqueror
had been instructed to claim the ancient prerogatives of that high
office, they must have expired with the period of its annual duration.
But the Romans were disposed to revere, in the person of their master,
that antique title which the emperors condescended to assume: the
Barbarian himself seemed to contract a sacred obligation to respect the
majesty of the republic; and the successors of Theodosius, by soliciting
his friendship, tacitly forgave, and almost ratified, the usurpation of
Gaul.

[Footnote 57: The Fasti of Italy would naturally reject a consul,
the enemy of their sovereign; but any ingenious hypothesis that might
explain the silence of Constantinople and Egypt, (the Chronicle of
Marcellinus, and the Paschal,) is overturned by the similar silence
of Marius, bishop of Avenche, who composed his Fasti in the kingdom
of Burgundy. If the evidence of Gregory of Tours were less weighty
and positive, (l. ii. c. 38, in tom. ii. p. 183,) I could believe
that Clovis, like Odoacer, received the lasting title and honors of
Patrician, (Pagi Critica, tom. ii. p. 474, 492.)]

Twenty-five years after the death of Clovis this important concession
was more formally declared, in a treaty between his sons and the emperor
Justinian. The Ostrogoths of Italy, unable to defend their distant
acquisitions, had resigned to the Franks the cities of Arles and
Marseilles; of Arles, still adorned with the seat of a Praetorian
praefect, and of Marseilles, enriched by the advantages of trade
and navigation. [58] This transaction was confirmed by the Imperial
authority; and Justinian, generously yielding to the Franks the
sovereignty of the countries beyond the Alps, which they already
possessed, absolved the provincials from their allegiance; and
established on a more lawful, though not more solid, foundation, the
throne of the Merovingians. [59] From that era they enjoyed the right
of celebrating at Arles the games of the circus; and by a singular
privilege, which was denied even to the Persian monarch, the gold coin,
impressed with their name and image, obtained a legal currency in the
empire. [60] A Greek historian of that age has praised the private and
public virtues of the Franks, with a partial enthusiasm, which cannot
be sufficiently justified by their domestic annals. [61] He celebrates
their politeness and urbanity, their regular government, and
orthodox religion; and boldly asserts, that these Barbarians could be
distinguished only by their dress and language from the subjects of
Rome. Perhaps the Franks already displayed the social disposition, and
lively graces, which, in every age, have disguised their vices, and
sometimes concealed their intrinsic merit. Perhaps Agathias, and the
Greeks, were dazzled by the rapid progress of their arms, and the
splendor of their empire. Since the conquest of Burgundy, Gaul, except
the Gothic province of Septimania, was subject, in its whole extent,
to the sons of Clovis. They had extinguished the German kingdom of
Thuringia, and their vague dominion penetrated beyond the Rhine, into
the heart of their native forests. The Alemanni, and Bavarians, who had
occupied the Roman provinces of Rhaetia and Noricum, to the south of the
Danube, confessed themselves the humble vassals of the Franks; and the
feeble barrier of the Alps was incapable of resisting their ambition.
When the last survivor of the sons of Clovis united the inheritance
and conquests of the Merovingians, his kingdom extended far beyond the
limits of modern France. Yet modern France, such has been the progress
of arts and policy, far surpasses, in wealth, populousness, and power,
the spacious but savage realms of Clotaire or Dagobert. [62]

[Footnote 58: Under the Merovingian kings, Marseilles still imported
from the East paper, wine, oil, linen, silk, precious stones, spices,
&c. The Gauls, or Franks, traded to Syria, and the Syrians were
established in Gaul. See M. de Guignes, Mem. de l'Academie, tom. xxxvii.
p. 471-475.]

[Footnote 59: This strong declaration of Procopius (de Bell. Gothic.
l. iii. cap. 33, in tom. ii. p. 41) would almost suffice to justify the
Abbe Dubos.]

[Footnote 60: The Franks, who probably used the mints of Treves, Lyons,
and Arles, imitated the coinage of the Roman emperors of seventy-two
solidi, or pieces, to the pound of gold. But as the Franks established
only a decuple proportion of gold and silver, ten shillings will be
a sufficient valuation of their solidus of gold. It was the common
standard of the Barbaric fines, and contained forty denarii, or silver
three pences. Twelve of these denarii made a solidus, or shilling, the
twentieth part of the ponderal and numeral livre, or pound of silver,
which has been so strangely reduced in modern France. See La Blanc,
Traite Historique des Monnoyes de France, p. 36-43, &c.]

[Footnote 61: Agathias, in tom. ii. p. 47. Gregory of Tours exhibits a
very different picture. Perhaps it would not be easy, within the same
historical space, to find more vice and less virtue. We are continually
shocked by the union of savage and corrupt manners.]

[Footnote 62: M. de Foncemagne has traced, in a correct and elegant
dissertation, (Mem. de l'Academie, tom. viii. p. 505-528,) the extent
and limits of the French monarchy.]

The Franks, or French, are the only people of Europe who can deduce
a perpetual succession from the conquerors of the Western empire. But
their conquest of Gaul was followed by ten centuries of anarchy and
ignorance. On the revival of learning, the students, who had been formed
in the schools of Athens and Rome, disdained their Barbarian ancestors;
and a long period elapsed before patient labor could provide the
requisite materials to satisfy, or rather to excite, the curiosity
of more enlightened times. [63] At length the eye of criticism
and philosophy was directed to the antiquities of France; but even
philosophers have been tainted by the contagion of prejudice and
passion. The most extreme and exclusive systems, of the personal
servitude of the Gauls, or of their voluntary and equal alliance with
the Franks, have been rashly conceived, and obstinately defended; and
the intemperate disputants have accused each other of conspiring against
the prerogative of the crown, the dignity of the nobles, or the freedom
of the people. Yet the sharp conflict has usefully exercised the
adverse powers of learning and genius; and each antagonist, alternately
vanquished and victorious has extirpated some ancient errors, and
established some interesting truths. An impartial stranger, instructed
by their discoveries, their disputes, and even their faults, may
describe, from the same original materials, the state of the Roman
provincials, after Gaul had submitted to the arms and laws of the
Merovingian kings. [64]

[Footnote 63: The Abbe Dubos (Histoire Critique, tom. i. p. 29-36) has
truly and agreeably represented the slow progress of these studies; and
he observes, that Gregory of Tours was only once printed before the
year 1560. According to the complaint of Heineccius, (Opera, tom. iii.
Sylloge, iii. p. 248, &c.,) Germany received with indifference and
contempt the codes of Barbaric laws, which were published by Heroldus,
Lindenbrogius, &c. At present those laws, (as far as they relate to
Gaul,) the history of Gregory of Tours, and all the monuments of the
Merovingian race, appear in a pure and perfect state, in the first four
volumes of the Historians of France.]

[Footnote 64: In the space of [about] thirty years (1728-1765) this
interesting subject has been agitated by the free spirit of the count
de Boulainvilliers, (Memoires Historiques sur l'Etat de la France,
particularly tom. i. p. 15-49;) the learned ingenuity of the Abbe Dubos,
(Histoire Critique de l'Etablissement de la Monarchie Francoise dans les
Gaules, 2 vols. in 4to;) the comprehensive genius of the president de
Montesquieu, (Esprit des Loix, particularly l. xxviii. xxx. xxxi.;) and
the good sense and diligence of the Abbe de Mably, (Observations sur
l'Histoire de France, 2 vols. 12mo.)] The rudest, or the most servile,
condition of human society, is regulated, however, by some fixed and
general rules. When Tacitus surveyed the primitive simplicity of the
Germans, he discovered some permanent maxims, or customs, of public
and private life, which were preserved by faithful tradition till the
introduction of the art of writing, and of the Latin tongue. [65] Before
the election of the Merovingian kings, the most powerful tribe, or
nation, of the Franks, appointed four venerable chieftains to compose
the Salic laws; [66] and their labors were examined and approved in
three successive assemblies of the people. After the baptism of
Clovis, he reformed several articles that appeared incompatible with
Christianity: the Salic law was again amended by his sons; and
at length, under the reign of Dagobert, the code was revised
and promulgated in its actual form, one hundred years after the
establishment of the French monarchy. Within the same period,
the customs of the Ripuarians were transcribed and published; and
Charlemagne himself, the legislator of his age and country, had
accurately studied the two national laws, which still prevailed among
the Franks. [67] The same care was extended to their vassals; and the
rude institutions of the Alemanni and Bavarians were diligently compiled
and ratified by the supreme authority of the Merovingian kings. The
Visigoths and Burgundians, whose conquests in Gaul preceded those of the
Franks, showed less impatience to attain one of the principal benefits
of civilized society. Euric was the first of the Gothic princes who
expressed, in writing, the manners and customs of his people; and the
composition of the Burgundian laws was a measure of policy rather than
of justice; to alleviate the yoke, and regain the affections, of their
Gallic subjects. [68] Thus, by a singular coincidence, the Germans
framed their artless institutions, at a time when the elaborate system
of Roman jurisprudence was finally consummated. In the Salic laws, and
the Pandects of Justinian, we may compare the first rudiments, and the
full maturity, of civil wisdom; and whatever prejudices may be suggested
in favor of Barbarism, our calmer reflections will ascribe to the Romans
the superior advantages, not only of science and reason, but of humanity
and justice. Yet the laws [681] of the Barbarians were adapted to their
wants and desires, their occupations and their capacity; and they all
contributed to preserve the peace, and promote the improvement, of
the society for whose use they were originally established. The
Merovingians, instead of imposing a uniform rule of conduct on their
various subjects, permitted each people, and each family, of their
empire, freely to enjoy their domestic institutions; [69] nor were the
Romans excluded from the common benefits of this legal toleration. [70]
The children embraced the law of their parents, the wife that of her
husband, the freedman that of his patron; and in all causes where the
parties were of different nations, the plaintiff or accuser was obliged
to follow the tribunal of the defendant, who may always plead a judicial
presumption of right, or innocence. A more ample latitude was allowed,
if every citizen, in the presence of the judge, might declare the law
under which he desired to live, and the national society to which
he chose to belong. Such an indulgence would abolish the partial
distinctions of victory: and the Roman provincials might patiently
acquiesce in the hardships of their condition; since it depended
on themselves to assume the privilege, if they dared to assert the
character, of free and warlike Barbarians. [71]

[Footnote 65: I have derived much instruction from two learned works
of Heineccius, the History, and the Elements, of the Germanic law. In a
judicious preface to the Elements, he considers, and tries to excuse the
defects of that barbarous jurisprudence.]

[Footnote 66: Latin appears to have been the original language of
the Salic law. It was probably composed in the beginning of the fifth
century, before the era (A.D. 421) of the real or fabulous Pharamond.
The preface mentions the four cantons which produced the four
legislators; and many provinces, Franconia, Saxony, Hanover, Brabant,
&c., have claimed them as their own. See an excellent Dissertation of
Heinecties de Lege Salica, tom. iii. Sylloge iii. p. 247-267. * Note:
The relative antiquity of the two copies of the Salic law has been
contested with great learning and ingenuity. The work of M. Wiarda,
History and Explanation of the Salic Law, Bremen, 1808, asserts that
what is called the Lex Antiqua, or Vetustior in which many German words
are mingled with the Latin, has no claim to superior antiquity, and may
be suspected to be more modern. M. Wiarda has been opposed by M. Fuer
bach, who maintains the higher age of the "ancient" Code, which has been
greatly corrupted by the transcribers. See Guizot, Cours de l'Histoire
Moderne, vol. i. sect. 9: and the preface to the useful republication of
five of the different texts of the Salic law, with that of the Ripuarian
in parallel columns. By E. A. I. Laspeyres, Halle, 1833.--M.]

[Footnote 67: Eginhard, in Vit. Caroli Magni, c. 29, in tom. v. p. 100.
By these two laws, most critics understand the Salic and the Ripuarian.
The former extended from the Carbonarian forest to the Loire, (tom.
iv. p. 151,) and the latter might be obeyed from the same forest to the
Rhine, (tom. iv. p. 222.)]

[Footnote 68: Consult the ancient and modern prefaces of the several
codes, in the fourth volume of the Historians of France. The original
prologue to the Salic law expresses (though in a foreign dialect) the
genuine spirit of the Franks more forcibly than the ten books of Gregory
of Tours.]

[Footnote 69: The Ripuarian law declares, and defines, this indulgence
in favor of the plaintiff, (tit. xxxi. in tom. iv. p. 240;) and the same
toleration is understood, or expressed, in all the codes, except that
of the Visigoths of Spain. Tanta diversitas legum (says Agobard in the
ninth century) quanta non solum in regionibus, aut civitatibus, sed
etiam in multis domibus habetur. Nam plerumque contingit ut simul eant
aut sedeant quinque homines, et nullus eorum communem legem cum altero
habeat, (in tom. vi. p. 356.) He foolishly proposes to introduce a
uniformity of law, as well as of faith. * Note: It is the object of
the important work of M. Savigny, Geschichte des Romisches Rechts in
Mittelalter, to show the perpetuity of the Roman law from the 5th to the
12th century.--M.]

[Footnote 681: The most complete collection of these codes is in the
"Barbarorum leges antiquae," by P. Canciani, 5 vols. folio, Venice,
1781-9.--M.]

[Footnote 70: Inter Romanos negotia causarum Romanis legibus praecipimus
terminari. Such are the words of a general constitution promulgated by
Clotaire, the son of Clovis, the sole monarch of the Franks (in tom. iv.
p. 116) about the year 560.]

[Footnote 71: This liberty of choice has been aptly deduced (Esprit
des Loix, l. xxviii. 2) from the constitution of Lothaire I. (Leg.
Langobard. l. ii. tit. lvii. in Codex Lindenbrog. p. 664;) though the
example is too recent and partial. From a various reading in the Salic
law, (tit. xliv. not. xlv.) the Abbe de Mably (tom. i. p. 290-293) has
conjectured, that, at first, a Barbarian only, and afterwards any man,
(consequently a Roman,) might live according to the law of the Franks.
I am sorry to offend this ingenious conjecture by observing, that
the stricter sense (Barbarum) is expressed in the reformed copy of
Charlemagne; which is confirmed by the Royal and Wolfenbuttle MSS. The
looser interpretation (hominem) is authorized only by the MS. of Fulda,
from from whence Heroldus published his edition. See the four original
texts of the Salic law in tom. iv. p. 147, 173, 196, 220. * Note: Gibbon
appears to have doubted the evidence on which this "liberty of choice"
rested. His doubts have been confirmed by the researches of M. Savigny,
who has not only confuted but traced with convincing sagacity the origin
and progress of this error. As a general principle, though liable to
some exceptions, each lived according to his native law. Romische Recht.
vol. i. p. 123-138--M. * Note: This constitution of Lothaire at first
related only to the duchy of Rome; it afterwards found its way into the
Lombard code. Savigny. p. 138.--M.]
