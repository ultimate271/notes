## Chapter LXIX: State Of Rome From The Twelfth Century.--Part III.

It was thus, about the middle of the thirteenth century, that the Romans
called from Bologna the senator Brancaleone, [48] whose fame and merit
have been rescued from oblivion by the pen of an English historian. A
just anxiety for his reputation, a clear foresight of the difficulties
of the task, had engaged him to refuse the honor of their choice: the
statutes of Rome were suspended, and his office prolonged to the term
of three years. By the guilty and licentious he was accused as cruel;
by the clergy he was suspected as partial; but the friends of peace and
order applauded the firm and upright magistrate by whom those blessings
were restored. No criminals were so powerful as to brave, so obscure as
to elude, the justice of the senator. By his sentence two nobles of
the Annibaldi family were executed on a gibbet; and he inexorably
demolished, in the city and neighborhood, one hundred and forty towers,
the strong shelters of rapine and mischief. The bishop, as a simple
bishop, was compelled to reside in his diocese; and the standard of
Brancaleone was displayed in the field with terror and effect. His
services were repaid by the ingratitude of a people unworthy of the
happiness which they enjoyed. By the public robbers, whom he had
provoked for their sake, the Romans were excited to depose and imprison
their benefactor; nor would his life have been spared, if Bologna had
not possessed a pledge for his safety. Before his departure, the prudent
senator had required the exchange of thirty hostages of the noblest
families of Rome: on the news of his danger, and at the prayer of his
wife, they were more strictly guarded; and Bologna, in the cause of
honor, sustained the thunders of a papal interdict. This generous
resistance allowed the Romans to compare the present with the past;
and Brancaleone was conducted from the prison to the Capitol amidst the
acclamations of a repentant people. The remainder of his government was
firm and fortunate; and as soon as envy was appeased by death, his head,
enclosed in a precious vase, was deposited on a lofty column of marble.
[49]

[Footnote 48: See the life and death of Brancaleone, in the Historia
Major of Matthew Paris, p. 741, 757, 792, 797, 799, 810, 823, 833,
836, 840. The multitude of pilgrims and suitors connected Rome and
St. Albans, and the resentment of the English clergy prompted them to
rejoice when ever the popes were humbled and oppressed.]

[Footnote 49: Matthew Paris thus ends his account: Caput vero ipsius
Brancaleonis in vase pretioso super marmoream columnam collocatum, in
signum sui valoris et probitatis, quasi reliquias, superstitiose nimis
et pompose sustulerunt. Fuerat enim superborum potentum et malefactorum
urbis malleus et extirpator, et populi protector et defensor veritatis
et justitiæ imitator et amator, (p. 840.) A biographer of Innocent IV.
(Muratori, Script. tom. iii. P. i. p. 591, 592) draws a less favorable
portrait of this Ghibeline senator.]

The impotence of reason and virtue recommended in Italy a more effectual
choice: instead of a private citizen, to whom they yielded a voluntary
and precarious obedience, the Romans elected for their senator some
prince of independent power, who could defend them from their enemies
and themselves. Charles of Anjou and Provence, the most ambitious and
warlike monarch of the age, accepted at the same time the kingdom of
Naples from the pope, and the office of senator from the Roman people.
[50] As he passed through the city, in his road to victory, he received
their oath of allegiance, lodged in the Lateran palace, and smoothed
in a short visit the harsh features of his despotic character. Yet even
Charles was exposed to the inconstancy of the people, who saluted
with the same acclamations the passage of his rival, the unfortunate
Conradin; and a powerful avenger, who reigned in the Capitol, alarmed
the fears and jealousy of the popes. The absolute term of his life was
superseded by a renewal every third year; and the enmity of Nicholas the
Third obliged the Sicilian king to abdicate the government of Rome.
In his bull, a perpetual law, the imperious pontiff asserts the truth,
validity, and use of the donation of Constantine, not less essential
to the peace of the city than to the independence of the church;
establishes the annual election of the senator; and formally
disqualifies all emperors, kings, princes, and persons of an eminent and
conspicuous rank. [51] This prohibitory clause was repealed in his own
behalf by Martin the Fourth, who humbly solicited the suffrage of
the Romans. In the presence, and by the authority, of the people, two
electors conferred, not on the pope, but on the noble and faithful
Martin, the dignity of senator, and the supreme administration of
the republic, [52] to hold during his natural life, and to exercise at
pleasure by himself or his deputies. About fifty years afterwards, the
same title was granted to the emperor Lewis of Bavaria; and the liberty
of Rome was acknowledged by her two sovereigns, who accepted a municipal
office in the government of their own metropolis.

[Footnote 50: The election of Charles of Anjou to the office of
perpetual senator of Rome is mentioned by the historians in the viiith
volume of the Collection of Muratori, by Nicholas de Jamsilla, (p. 592,)
the monk of Padua, (p. 724,) Sabas Malaspina, (l. ii. c. 9, p. 308,) and
Ricordano Malespini, (c. 177, p. 999.)]

[Footnote 51: The high-sounding bull of Nicholas III., which founds his
temporal sovereignty on the donation of Constantine, is still extant;
and as it has been inserted by Boniface VIII. in the _Sexte_ of the
Decretals, it must be received by the Catholics, or at least by the
Papists, as a sacred and perpetual law.]

[Footnote 52: I am indebted to Fleury (Hist. Ecclés. tom. xviii. p.
306) for an extract of this Roman act, which he has taken from the
Ecclesiastical Annals of Odericus Raynaldus, A.D. 1281, No. 14, 15.]

In the first moments of rebellion, when Arnold of Brescia had inflamed
their minds against the church, the Romans artfully labored to
conciliate the favor of the empire, and to recommend their merit and
services in the cause of Cæsar. The style of their ambassadors to Conrad
the Third and Frederic the First is a mixture of flattery and pride,
the tradition and the ignorance of their own history. [53] After some
complaint of his silence and neglect, they exhort the former of these
princes to pass the Alps, and assume from their hands the Imperial
crown. "We beseech your majesty not to disdain the humility of your sons
and vassals, not to listen to the accusations of our common enemies; who
calumniate the senate as hostile to your throne, who sow the seeds of
discord, that they may reap the harvest of destruction. The pope and the
_Sicilian_ are united in an impious league to oppose _our_ liberty and
_your_ coronation. With the blessing of God, our zeal and courage
has hitherto defeated their attempts. Of their powerful and factious
adherents, more especially the Frangipani, we have taken by assault the
houses and turrets: some of these are occupied by our troops, and some
are levelled with the ground. The Milvian bridge, which they had broken,
is restored and fortified for your safe passage; and your army may enter
the city without being annoyed from the castle of St. Angelo. All that
we have done, and all that we design, is for your honor and service, in
the loyal hope, that you will speedily appear in person, to vindicate
those rights which have been invaded by the clergy, to revive the
dignity of the empire, and to surpass the fame and glory of your
predecessors. May you fix your residence in Rome, the capital of the
world; give laws to Italy, and the Teutonic kingdom; and imitate the
example of Constantine and Justinian, [54] who, by the vigor of the
senate and people, obtained the sceptre of the earth." [55] But these
splendid and fallacious wishes were not cherished by Conrad the
Franconian, whose eyes were fixed on the Holy Land, and who died without
visiting Rome soon after his return from the Holy Land.

[Footnote 53: These letters and speeches are preserved by Otho bishop of
Frisingen, (Fabric. Bibliot. Lat. Med. et Infim. tom. v. p. 186, 187,)
perhaps the noblest of historians: he was son of Leopold marquis of
Austria; his mother, Agnes, was daughter of the emperor Henry IV., and
he was half-brother and uncle to Conrad III. and Frederic I. He has
left, in seven books, a Chronicle of the Times; in two, the Gesta
Frederici I., the last of which is inserted in the vith volume of
Muratori's historians.]

[Footnote 54: We desire (said the ignorant Romans) to restore the empire
in um statum, quo fuit tempore Constantini et Justiniani, qui totum
orbem vigore senatûs et populi Romani suis tenuere manibus.]

[Footnote 55: Otho Frising. de Gestis Frederici I. l. i. c. 28, p.
662--664.]

His nephew and successor, Frederic Barbarossa, was more ambitious of
the Imperial crown; nor had any of the successors of Otho acquired
such absolute sway over the kingdom of Italy. Surrounded by his
ecclesiastical and secular princes, he gave audience in his camp at
Sutri to the ambassadors of Rome, who thus addressed him in a free and
florid oration: "Incline your ear to the queen of cities; approach with
a peaceful and friendly mind the precincts of Rome, which has cast
away the yoke of the clergy, and is impatient to crown her legitimate
emperor. Under your auspicious influence, may the primitive times be
restored. Assert the prerogatives of the eternal city, and reduce under
her monarchy the insolence of the world. You are not ignorant, that, in
former ages, by the wisdom of the senate, by the valor and discipline of
the equestrian order, she extended her victorious arms to the East and
West, beyond the Alps, and over the islands of the ocean. By our sins,
in the absence of our princes, the noble institution of the senate
has sunk in oblivion; and with our prudence, our strength has likewise
decreased. We have revived the senate, and the equestrian order: the
counsels of the one, the arms of the other, will be devoted to your
person and the service of the empire. Do you not hear the language of
the Roman matron? You were a guest, I have adopted you as a citizen; a
Transalpine stranger, I have elected you for my sovereign; [56] and given
you myself, and all that is mine. Your first and most sacred duty is
to swear and subscribe, that you will shed your blood for the republic;
that you will maintain in peace and justice the laws of the city and
the charters of your predecessors; and that you will reward with five
thousand pounds of silver the faithful senators who shall proclaim
your titles in the Capitol. With the name, assume the character, of
Augustus." The flowers of Latin rhetoric were not yet exhausted; but
Frederic, impatient of their vanity, interrupted the orators in the high
tone of royalty and conquest. "Famous indeed have been the fortitude
and wisdom of the ancient Romans; but your speech is not seasoned
with wisdom, and I could wish that fortitude were conspicuous in your
actions. Like all sublunary things, Rome has felt the vicissitudes of
time and fortune. Your noblest families were translated to the East,
to the royal city of Constantine; and the remains of your strength and
freedom have long since been exhausted by the Greeks and Franks. Are
you desirous of beholding the ancient glory of Rome, the gravity of the
senate, the spirit of the knights, the discipline of the camp, the valor
of the legions? you will find them in the German republic. It is not
empire, naked and alone, the ornaments and virtues of empire have
likewise migrated beyond the Alps to a more deserving people: [57] they
will be employed in your defence, but they claim your obedience. You
pretend that myself or my predecessors have been invited by the Romans:
you mistake the word; they were not invited, they were implored. From
its foreign and domestic tyrants, the city was rescued by Charlemagne
and Otho, whose ashes repose in our country; and their dominion was the
price of your deliverance. Under that dominion your ancestors lived and
died. I claim by the right of inheritance and possession, and who shall
dare to extort you from my hands? Is the hand of the Franks [58] and
Germans enfeebled by age? Am I vanquished? Am I a captive? Am I not
encompassed with the banners of a potent and invincible army? You impose
conditions on your master; you require oaths: if the conditions are
just, an oath is superfluous; if unjust, it is criminal. Can you doubt
my equity? It is extended to the meanest of my subjects. Will not my
sword be unsheathed in the defence of the Capitol? By that sword the
northern kingdom of Denmark has been restored to the Roman empire. You
prescribe the measure and the objects of my bounty, which flows in a
copious but a voluntary stream. All will be given to patient merit; all
will be denied to rude importunity." [59] Neither the emperor nor the
senate could maintain these lofty pretensions of dominion and liberty.
United with the pope, and suspicious of the Romans, Frederic continued
his march to the Vatican; his coronation was disturbed by a sally from
the Capitol; and if the numbers and valor of the Germans prevailed in
the bloody conflict, he could not safely encamp in the presence of
a city of which he styled himself the sovereign. About twelve years
afterwards, he besieged Rome, to seat an antipope in the chair of St.
Peter; and twelve Pisan galleys were introduced into the Tyber: but the
senate and people were saved by the arts of negotiation and the progress
of disease; nor did Frederic or his successors reiterate the hostile
attempt. Their laborious reigns were exercised by the popes, the
crusades, and the independence of Lombardy and Germany: they courted the
alliance of the Romans; and Frederic the Second offered in the Capitol
the great standard, the _Caroccio_ of Milan. [60] After the extinction of
the house of Swabia, they were banished beyond the Alps: and their last
coronations betrayed the impotence and poverty of the Teutonic Cæsars.

[Footnote 58: Otho of Frisingen, who surely understood the language of
the court and diet of Germany, speaks of the Franks in the xiith

[Footnote 60: From the Chronicles of Ricobaldo and Francis Pipin,
Muratori (dissert. xxvi. tom. ii. p. 492) has translated this curious
fact with the doggerel verses that accompanied the gift:--
     Ave decus orbis, ave! victus tibi destinor, ave!
     Currus ab Augusto Frederico Cæsare justo.
     Væ Mediolanum! jam sentis spernere vanum
     Imperii vires, proprias tibi tollere vires.
     Ergo triumphorum urbs potes memor esse priorum
     Quos tibi mittebant reges qui bella gerebant.
Ne si dee tacere (I now use the Italian Dissertations, tom. i. p. 444)
che nell' anno 1727, una copia desso Caroccio in marmo dianzi ignoto si
scopri, nel campidoglio, presso alle carcere di quel luogo, dove Sisto
V. l'avea falto rinchiudere. Stava esso posto sopra quatro colonne di
marmo fino colla sequente inscrizione, &c.; to the same purpose as the
old inscription.]

[Footnote 61: The decline of the Imperial arms and authority in Italy is
related with impartial learning in the Annals of Muratori, (tom. x. xi.
xii.;) and the reader may compare his narrative with the Histoires des
Allemands (tom. iii. iv.) by Schmidt, who has deserved the esteem of his
countrymen.]

Under the reign of Adrian, when the empire extended from the Euphrates
to the ocean, from Mount Atlas to the Grampian hills, a fanciful
historian [62] amused the Romans with the picture of their ancient wars.
"There was a time," says Florus, "when Tibur and Præneste, our summer
retreats, were the objects of hostile vows in the Capitol, when we
dreaded the shades of the Arician groves, when we could triumph without
a blush over the nameless villages of the Sabines and Latins, and even
Corioli could afford a title not unworthy of a victorious general." The
pride of his contemporaries was gratified by the contrast of the
past and the present: they would have been humbled by the prospect
of futurity; by the prediction, that after a thousand years, Rome,
despoiled of empire, and contracted to her primæval limits, would renew
the same hostilities, on the same ground which was then decorated with
her villas and gardens. The adjacent territory on either side of the
Tyber was always claimed, and sometimes possessed, as the patrimony of
St. Peter; but the barons assumed a lawless independence, and the cities
too faithfully copied the revolt and discord of the metropolis. In
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the Romans incessantly labored to
reduce or destroy the contumacious vassals of the church and senate; and
if their headstrong and selfish ambition was moderated by the pope, he
often encouraged their zeal by the alliance of his spiritual arms. Their
warfare was that of the first consuls and dictators, who were taken from
the plough. The assembled in arms at the foot of the Capitol; sallied
from the gates, plundered or burnt the harvests of their neighbors,
engaged in tumultuary conflict, and returned home after an expedition of
fifteen or twenty days. Their sieges were tedious and unskilful: in
the use of victory, they indulged the meaner passions of jealousy
and revenge; and instead of adopting the valor, they trampled on the
misfortunes, of their adversaries. The captives, in their shirts, with a
rope round their necks, solicited their pardon: the fortifications,
and even the buildings, of the rival cities, were demolished, and the
inhabitants were scattered in the adjacent villages. It was thus that
the seats of the cardinal bishops, Porto, Ostia, Albanum, Tusculum,
Præneste, and Tibur or Tivoli, were successively overthrown by the
ferocious hostility of the Romans. [63] Of these, [64] Porto and Ostia,
the two keys of the Tyber, are still vacant and desolate: the marshy and
unwholesome banks are peopled with herds of buffaloes, and the river is
lost to every purpose of navigation and trade. The hills, which afford
a shady retirement from the autumnal heats, have again smiled with the
blessings of peace; Frescati has arisen near the ruins of Tusculum;
Tibur or Tivoli has resumed the honors of a city, [65] and the meaner
towns of Albano and Palestrina are decorated with the villas of the
cardinals and princes of Rome. In the work of destruction, the ambition
of the Romans was often checked and repulsed by the neighboring cities
and their allies: in the first siege of Tibur, they were driven from
their camp; and the battles of Tusculum [66] and Viterbo [67] might be
compared in their relative state to the memorable fields of Thrasymene
and Cannæ. In the first of these petty wars, thirty thousand Romans
were overthrown by a thousand German horse, whom Frederic Barbarossa had
detached to the relief of Tusculum: and if we number the slain at three,
the prisoners at two, thousand, we shall embrace the most authentic
and moderate account. Sixty-eight years afterwards they marched against
Viterbo in the ecclesiastical state with the whole force of the city; by
a rare coalition the Teutonic eagle was blended, in the adverse banners,
with the keys of St. Peter; and the pope's auxiliaries were commanded
by a count of Thoulouse and a bishop of Winchester. The Romans were
discomfited with shame and slaughter: but the English prelate must have
indulged the vanity of a pilgrim, if he multiplied their numbers to one
hundred, and their loss in the field to thirty, thousand men. Had the
policy of the senate and the discipline of the legions been restored
with the Capitol, the divided condition of Italy would have offered the
fairest opportunity of a second conquest. But in arms, the modern Romans
were not _above_, and in arts, they were far _below_, the common level
of the neighboring republics. Nor was their warlike spirit of any long
continuance; after some irregular sallies, they subsided in the national
apathy, in the neglect of military institutions, and in the disgraceful
and dangerous use of foreign mercenaries.

[Footnote 62: Tibur nunc suburbanum, et æstivæ Præneste deliciæ,
nuncupatis in Capitolio votis petebantur. The whole passage of Florus
(l. i. c. 11) may be read with pleasure, and has deserved the praise of
a man of genius, (uvres de Montesquieu, tom. iii. p. 634, 635, quarto
edition.)]

[Footnote 63: Ne a feritate Romanorum, sicut fuerant Hostienses,
Portuenses, Tusculanenses, Albanenses, Labicenses, et nuper Tiburtini
destruerentur, (Matthew Paris, p. 757.) These events are marked in the
Annals and Index (the xviiith volume) of Muratori.]

[Footnote 64: For the state or ruin of these suburban cities, the banks
of the Tyber, &c., see the lively picture of the P. Labat, (Voyage en
Espagne et en Italiæ,) who had long resided in the neighborhood of Rome,
and the more accurate description of which P. Eschinard (Roma, 1750, in
octavo) has added to the topographical map of Cingolani.]

[Footnote 65: Labat (tom. iii. p. 233) mentions a recent decree of the
Roman government, which has severely mortified the pride and poverty of
Tivoli: in civitate Tiburtinâ non vivitur civiliter.]

[Footnote 66: I depart from my usual method, of quoting only by the
date the Annals of Muratori, in consideration of the critical balance in
which he has weighed nine contemporary writers who mention the battle of
Tusculum, (tom. x. p. 42--44.)]

[Footnote 67: Matthew Paris, p. 345. This bishop of Winchester was Peter
de Rupibus, who occupied the see thirty-two years, (A.D. 1206--1238.)
and is described, by the English historian, as a soldier and a
statesman. (p. 178, 399.)]

Ambition is a weed of quick and early vegetation in the vineyard of
Christ. Under the first Christian princes, the chair of St. Peter
was disputed by the votes, the venality, the violence, of a popular
election: the sanctuaries of Rome were polluted with blood; and, from
the third to the twelfth century, the church was distracted by the
mischief of frequent schisms. As long as the final appeal was determined
by the civil magistrate, these mischiefs were transient and local:
the merits were tried by equity or favor; nor could the unsuccessful
competitor long disturb the triumph of his rival. But after the
emperors had been divested of their prerogatives, after a maxim had been
established that the vicar of Christ is amenable to no earthly tribunal,
each vacancy of the holy see might involve Christendom in controversy
and war. The claims of the cardinals and inferior clergy, of the
nobles and people, were vague and litigious: the freedom of choice was
overruled by the tumults of a city that no longer owned or obeyed a
superior. On the decease of a pope, two factions proceeded in different
churches to a double election: the number and weight of votes, the
priority of time, the merit of the candidates, might balance each
other: the most respectable of the clergy were divided; and the distant
princes, who bowed before the spiritual throne, could not distinguish
the spurious, from the legitimate, idol. The emperors were often the
authors of the schism, from the political motive of opposing a friendly
to a hostile pontiff; and each of the competitors was reduced to suffer
the insults of his enemies, who were not awed by conscience, and to
purchase the support of his adherents, who were instigated by avarice
or ambition a peaceful and perpetual succession was ascertained by
Alexander the Third, [68] who finally abolished the tumultuary votes of
the clergy and people, and defined the right of election in the sole
college of cardinals. [69] The three orders of bishops, priests, and
deacons, were assimilated to each other by this important privilege; the
parochial clergy of Rome obtained the first rank in the hierarchy: they
were indifferently chosen among the nations of Christendom; and the
possession of the richest benefices, of the most important bishoprics,
was not incompatible with their title and office. The senators of the
Catholic church, the coadjutors and legates of the supreme pontiff,
were robed in purple, the symbol of martyrdom or royalty; they claimed
a proud equality with kings; and their dignity was enhanced by the
smallness of their number, which, till the reign of Leo the Tenth,
seldom exceeded twenty or twenty-five persons. By this wise regulation,
all doubt and scandal were removed, and the root of schism was so
effectually destroyed, that in a period of six hundred years a double
choice has only once divided the unity of the sacred college. But as
the concurrence of two thirds of the votes had been made necessary, the
election was often delayed by the private interest and passions of
the cardinals; and while they prolonged their independent reign, the
Christian world was left destitute of a head. A vacancy of almost three
years had preceded the elevation of George the Tenth, who resolved to
prevent the future abuse; and his bull, after some opposition, has been
consecrated in the code of the canon law. [70] Nine days are allowed
for the obsequies of the deceased pope, and the arrival of the absent
cardinals; on the tenth, they are imprisoned, each with one domestic,
in a common apartment or _conclave_, without any separation of walls
or curtains: a small window is reserved for the introduction of
necessaries; but the door is locked on both sides and guarded by the
magistrates of the city, to seclude them from all correspondence with
the world. If the election be not consummated in three days, the luxury
of their table is contracted to a single dish at dinner and supper; and
after the eighth day, they are reduced to a scanty allowance of bread,
water, and wine. During the vacancy of the holy see, the cardinals are
prohibited from touching the revenues, or assuming, unless in some rare
emergency, the government of the church: all agreements and promises
among the electors are formally annulled; and their integrity is
fortified by their solemn oath and the prayers of the Catholics. Some
articles of inconvenient or superfluous rigor have been gradually
relaxed, but the principle of confinement is vigorous and entire: they
are still urged, by the personal motives of health and freedom, to
accelerate the moment of their deliverance; and the improvement of
ballot or secret votes has wrapped the struggles of the conclave [71] in
the silky veil of charity and politeness. [72] By these institutions the
Romans were excluded from the election of their prince and bishop; and
in the fever of wild and precarious liberty, they seemed insensible of
the loss of this inestimable privilege. The emperor Lewis of Bavaria
revived the example of the great Otho. After some negotiation with the
magistrates, the Roman people were assembled [73] in the square before
St. Peter's: the pope of Avignon, John the Twenty-second, was deposed:
the choice of his successor was ratified by their consent and applause.
They freely voted for a new law, that their bishop should never be
absent more than three months in the year, and two days' journey from
the city; and that if he neglected to return on the third summons, the
public servant should be degraded and dismissed. [74] But Lewis forgot
his own debility and the prejudices of the times: beyond the precincts
of a German camp, his useless phantom was rejected; the Romans despised
their own workmanship; the antipope implored the mercy of his lawful
sovereign; [75] and the exclusive right of the cardinals was more firmly
established by this unseasonable attack.

[Footnote 68: See Mosheim, Institut. Histor. Ecclesiast. p. 401, 403.
Alexander himself had nearly been the victim of a contested election;
and the doubtful merits of Innocent had only preponderated by the weight
of genius and learning which St. Bernard cast into the scale, (see his
life and writings.)]

[Footnote 69: The origin, titles, importance, dress, precedency, &c., of
the Roman cardinals, are very ably discussed by Thomassin, (Discipline
de l'Eglise, tom. i. p. 1262--1287;) but their purple is now much faded.
The sacred college was raised to the definite number of seventy-two, to
represent, under his vicar, the disciples of Christ.]

[Footnote 70: See the bull of Gregory X. approbante sacro concilio, in
the _Sexts_ of the Canon Law, (l. i. tit. 6, c. 3,) a supplement to
the Decretals, which Boniface VIII. promulgated at Rome in 1298, and
addressed in all the universities of Europe.]

[Footnote 71: The genius of Cardinal de Retz had a right to paint
a conclave, (of 1665,) in which he was a spectator and an actor,
(Mémoires, tom. iv. p. 15--57;) but I am at a loss to appreciate the
knowledge or authority of an anonymous Italian, whose history (Conclavi
de' Pontifici Romani, in 4to. 1667) has been continued since the reign
of Alexander VII. The accidental form of the work furnishes a lesson,
though not an antidote, to ambition. From a labyrinth of intrigues, we
emerge to the adoration of the successful candidate; but the next page
opens with his funeral.]

[Footnote 72: The expressions of Cardinal de Retz are positive and
picturesque: On y vecut toujours ensemble avec le même respect, et la
même civilité que l'on observe dans le cabinet des rois, avec la
même politesse qu'on avoit dans la cour de Henri III., avec la même
familiarité que l'on voit dans les colleges; avec la même modestie, qui
se remarque dans les noviciats; et avec la même charité, du moins en
apparence, qui pourroit ètre entre des frères parfaitement unis.]

[Footnote 73: Richiesti per bando (says John Villani) sanatori di Roma,
e 52 del popolo, et capitani de' 25, e consoli, (_consoli?_) et 13 buone
huomini, uno per rione. Our knowledge is too imperfect to pronounce
how much of this constitution was temporary, and how much ordinary and
permanent. Yet it is faintly illustrated by the ancient statutes of
Rome.]

[Footnote 74: Villani (l. x. c. 68--71, in Muratori, Script. tom. xiii.
p. 641--645) relates this law, and the whole transaction, with much less
abhorrence than the prudent Muratori. Any one conversant with the darker
ages must have observed how much the sense (I mean the nonsense) of
superstition is fluctuating and inconsistent.]

Had the election been always held in the Vatican, the rights of the
senate and people would not have been violated with impunity. But the
Romans forgot, and were forgotten. in the absence of the successors of
Gregory the Seventh, who did not keep as a divine precept their ordinary
residence in the city and diocese. The care of that diocese was less
important than the government of the universal church; nor could the
popes delight in a city in which their authority was always opposed, and
their person was often endangered. From the persecution of the emperors,
and the wars of Italy, they escaped beyond the Alps into the hospitable
bosom of France; from the tumults of Rome they prudently withdrew to
live and die in the more tranquil stations of Anagni, Perugia, Viterbo,
and the adjacent cities. When the flock was offended or impoverished by
the absence of the shepherd, they were recalled by a stern admonition,
that St. Peter had fixed his chair, not in an obscure village, but in
the capital of the world; by a ferocious menace, that the Romans would
march in arms to destroy the place and people that should dare to afford
them a retreat. They returned with timorous obedience; and were
saluted with the account of a heavy debt, of all the losses which their
desertion had occasioned, the hire of lodgings, the sale of provisions,
and the various expenses of servants and strangers who attended the
court. [76] After a short interval of peace, and perhaps of authority,
they were again banished by new tumults, and again summoned by the
imperious or respectful invitation of the senate. In these occasional
retreats, the exiles and fugitives of the Vatican were seldom long, or
far, distant from the metropolis; but in the beginning of the fourteenth
century, the apostolic throne was transported, as it might seem forever,
from the Tyber to the Rhône; and the cause of the transmigration may
be deduced from the furious contest between Boniface the Eighth and the
king of France. [77] The spiritual arms of excommunication and interdict
were repulsed by the union of the three estates, and the privileges of
the Gallican church; but the pope was not prepared against the carnal
weapons which Philip the Fair had courage to employ. As the pope resided
at Anagni, without the suspicion of danger, his palace and person
were assaulted by three hundred horse, who had been secretly levied by
William of Nogaret, a French minister, and Sciarra Colonna, of a noble
but hostile family of Rome. The cardinals fled; the inhabitants of
Anagni were seduced from their allegiance and gratitude; but the
dauntless Boniface, unarmed and alone, seated himself in his chair, and
awaited, like the conscript fathers of old, the swords of the Gauls.
Nogaret, a foreign adversary, was content to execute the orders of his
master: by the domestic enmity of Colonna, he was insulted with
words and blows; and during a confinement of three days his life was
threatened by the hardships which they inflicted on the obstinacy
which they provoked. Their strange delay gave time and courage to the
adherents of the church, who rescued him from sacrilegious violence; but
his imperious soul was wounded in the vital part; and Boniface expired
at Rome in a frenzy of rage and revenge. His memory is stained with
the glaring vices of avarice and pride; nor has the courage of a martyr
promoted this ecclesiastical champion to the honors of a saint; a
magnanimous sinner, (say the chronicles of the times,) who entered like
a fox, reigned like a lion, and died like a dog. He was succeeded by
Benedict the Eleventh, the mildest of mankind. Yet he excommunicated the
impious emissaries of Philip, and devoted the city and people of Anagni
by a tremendous curse, whose effects are still visible to the eyes of
superstition. [78]

[Footnote 76: Romani autem non valentes nec volentes ultra suam celare
cupiditatem gravissimam, contra papam movere cperunt questionem,
exigentes ab eo urgentissime omnia quæ subierant per ejus absentiam
damna et jacturas, videlicet in hispitiis locandis, in mercimoniis,
in usuris, in redditibus, in provisionibus, et in aliis modis
innumerabilibus. Quòd cum audisset papa, præcordialiter ingemuit, et se
comperiens _muscipulatum_, &c., Matt. Paris, p. 757. For the ordinary
history of the popes, their life and death, their residence and absence,
it is enough to refer to the ecclesiastical annalists, Spondanus and
Fleury.]

[Footnote 77: Besides the general historians of the church of Italy and
of France, we possess a valuable treatise composed by a learned friend
of Thuanus, which his last and best editors have published in the
appendix (Histoire particulière du grand Différend entre Boniface VIII
et Philippe le Bel, par Pierre du Puis, tom. vii. P. xi. p. 61--82.)]

[Footnote 78: It is difficult to know whether Labat (tom. iv. p. 53--57)
be in jest or in earnest, when he supposes that Anagni still feels
the weight of this curse, and that the cornfields, or vineyards, or
olive-trees, are annually blasted by Nature, the obsequious handmaid of
the popes.]
