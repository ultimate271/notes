## Chapter XXXVI: Total Extinction Of The Western Empire.--Part IV.

In all his public declarations, the emperor Leo assumes the authority,
and professes the affection, of a father, for his son Anthemius,
with whom he had divided the administration of the universe. [83]
The situation, and perhaps the character, of Leo, dissuaded him from
exposing his person to the toils and dangers of an African war. But the
powers of the Eastern empire were strenuously exerted to deliver Italy
and the Mediterranean from the Vandals; and Genseric, who had so long
oppressed both the land and sea, was threatened from every side with a
formidable invasion. The campaign was opened by a bold and successful
enterprise of the praefect Heraclius. [84] The troops of Egypt, Thebais,
and Libya, were embarked, under his command; and the Arabs, with a train
of horses and camels, opened the roads of the desert. Heraclius landed
on the coast of Tripoli, surprised and subdued the cities of that
province, and prepared, by a laborious march, which Cato had formerly
executed, [85] to join the Imperial army under the walls of Carthage.
The intelligence of this loss extorted from Genseric some insidious
and ineffectual propositions of peace; but he was still more seriously
alarmed by the reconciliation of Marcellinus with the two empires. The
independent patrician had been persuaded to acknowledge the legitimate
title of Anthemius, whom he accompanied in his journey to Rome; the
Dalmatian fleet was received into the harbors of Italy; the active valor
of Marcellinus expelled the Vandals from the Island of Sardinia; and
the languid efforts of the West added some weight to the immense
preparations of the Eastern Romans. The expense of the naval armament,
which Leo sent against the Vandals, has been distinctly ascertained; and
the curious and instructive account displays the wealth of the declining
empire. The Royal demesnes, or private patrimony of the prince, supplied
seventeen thousand pounds of gold; forty-seven thousand pounds of gold,
and seven hundred thousand of silver, were levied and paid into the
treasury by the Praetorian praefects. But the cities were reduced to
extreme poverty; and the diligent calculation of fines and forfeitures,
as a valuable object of the revenue, does not suggest the idea of a just
or merciful administration. The whole expense, by whatsoever means
it was defrayed, of the African campaign, amounted to the sum of one
hundred and thirty thousand pounds of gold, about five millions two
hundred thousand pounds sterling, at a time when the value of money
appears, from the comparative price of corn, to have been somewhat
higher than in the present age. [86] The fleet that sailed from
Constantinople to Carthage, consisted of eleven hundred and thirteen
ships, and the number of soldiers and mariners exceeded one hundred
thousand men. Basiliscus, the brother of the empress Vorina, was
intrusted with this important command. His sister, the wife of Leo, had
exaggerated the merit of his former exploits against the Scythians. But
the discovery of his guilt, or incapacity, was reserved for the
African war; and his friends could only save his military reputation by
asserting, that he had conspired with Aspar to spare Genseric, and to
betray the last hope of the Western empire.

[Footnote 83: Itaque nos quibus totius mundi regimen commisit superna
provisio.... Pius et triumphator semper Augustus filius noster
Anthemius, licet Divina Majestas et nostra creatio pietati ejus plenam
Imperii commiserit potestatem, &c..... Such is the dignified style of
Leo, whom Anthemius respectfully names, Dominus et Pater meus Princeps
sacratissimus Leo. See Novell. Anthem. tit. ii. iii. p. 38, ad calcem
Cod. Theod.]

[Footnote 84: The expedition of Heraclius is clouded with difficulties,
(Tillemont, Hist. des Empereurs, tom. vi. p. 640,) and it requires
some dexterity to use the circumstances afforded by Theophanes, without
injury to the more respectable evidence of Procopius.]

[Footnote 85: The march of Cato from Berenice, in the province of
Cyrene, was much longer than that of Heraclius from Tripoli. He passed
the deep sandy desert in thirty days, and it was found necessary to
provide, besides the ordinary supplies, a great number of skins filled
with water, and several Psylli, who were supposed to possess the art of
sucking the wounds which had been made by the serpents of their native
country. See Plutarch in Caton. Uticens. tom. iv. p. 275. Straben
Geograph. l. xxii. p. 1193.]

[Footnote 86: The principal sum is clearly expressed by Procopius, (de
Bell. Vandal. l. i. c. 6, p. 191;) the smaller constituent parts,
which Tillemont, (Hist. des Empereurs, tom. vi. p. 396) has laboriously
collected from the Byzantine writers, are less certain, and less
important. The historian Malchus laments the public misery, (Excerpt.
ex Suida in Corp. Hist. Byzant. p. 58;) but he is surely unjust, when
he charges Leo with hoarding the treasures which he extorted from the
people. * Note: Compare likewise the newly-discovered work of Lydus, de
Magistratibus, ed. Hase, Paris, 1812, (and in the new collection of the
Byzantines,) l. iii. c. 43. Lydus states the expenditure at 65,000
lbs. of gold, 700,000 of silver. But Lydus exaggerates the fleet to the
incredible number of 10,000 long ships, (Liburnae,) and the troops to
400,000 men. Lydus describes this fatal measure, of which he charges the
blame on Basiliscus, as the shipwreck of the state. From that time all
the revenues of the empire were anticipated; and the finances fell into
inextricable confusion.--M.] Experience has shown, that the success
of an invader most commonly depends on the vigor and celerity of his
operations. The strength and sharpness of the first impression are
blunted by delay; the health and spirit of the troops insensibly
languish in a distant climate; the naval and military force, a mighty
effort which perhaps can never be repeated, is silently consumed;
and every hour that is wasted in negotiation, accustoms the enemy to
contemplate and examine those hostile terrors, which, on their first
appearance, he deemed irresistible. The formidable navy of Basiliscus
pursued its prosperous navigation from the Thracian Bosphorus to the
coast of Africa. He landed his troops at Cape Bona, or the promontory
of Mercury, about forty miles from Carthage. [87] The army of Heraclius,
and the fleet of Marcellinus, either joined or seconded the Imperial
lieutenant; and the Vandals who opposed his progress by sea or land,
were successively vanquished. [88] If Basiliscus had seized the moment
of consternation, and boldly advanced to the capital, Carthage must have
surrendered, and the kingdom of the Vandals was extinguished. Genseric
beheld the danger with firmness, and eluded it with his veteran
dexterity. He protested, in the most respectful language, that he
was ready to submit his person, and his dominions, to the will of the
emperor; but he requested a truce of five days to regulate the terms
of his submission; and it was universally believed, that his secret
liberality contributed to the success of this public negotiation.
Instead of obstinately refusing whatever indulgence his enemy so
earnestly solicited, the guilty, or the credulous, Basiliscus consented
to the fatal truce; and his imprudent security seemed to proclaim, that
he already considered himself as the conqueror of Africa. During this
short interval, the wind became favorable to the designs of Genseric.
He manned his largest ships of war with the bravest of the Moors
and Vandals; and they towed after them many large barks, filled with
combustible materials. In the obscurity of the night, these destructive
vessels were impelled against the unguarded and unsuspecting fleet of
the Romans, who were awakened by the sense of their instant danger.
Their close and crowded order assisted the progress of the fire, which
was communicated with rapid and irresistible violence; and the noise
of the wind, the crackling of the flames, the dissonant cries of the
soldiers and mariners, who could neither command nor obey, increased
the horror of the nocturnal tumult. Whilst they labored to extricate
themselves from the fire-ships, and to save at least a part of the navy,
the galleys of Genseric assaulted them with temperate and disciplined
valor; and many of the Romans, who escaped the fury of the flames, were
destroyed or taken by the victorious Vandals. Among the events of that
disastrous night, the heroic, or rather desperate, courage of John,
one of the principal officers of Basiliscus, has rescued his name from
oblivion. When the ship, which he had bravely defended, was almost
consumed, he threw himself in his armor into the sea, disdainfully
rejected the esteem and pity of Genso, the son of Genseric, who pressed
him to accept honorable quarter, and sunk under the waves; exclaiming,
with his last breath, that he would never fall alive into the hands
of those impious dogs. Actuated by a far different spirit, Basiliscus,
whose station was the most remote from danger, disgracefully fled in the
beginning of the engagement, returned to Constantinople with the loss of
more than half of his fleet and army, and sheltered his guilty head
in the sanctuary of St. Sophia, till his sister, by her tears and
entreaties, could obtain his pardon from the indignant emperor.
Heraclius effected his retreat through the desert; Marcellinus retired
to Sicily, where he was assassinated, perhaps at the instigation
of Ricimer, by one of his own captains; and the king of the Vandals
expressed his surprise and satisfaction, that the Romans themselves
should remove from the world his most formidable antagonists. [89] After
the failure of this great expedition, [891] Genseric again became the
tyrant of the sea: the coasts of Italy, Greece, and Asia, were again
exposed to his revenge and avarice; Tripoli and Sardinia returned to his
obedience; he added Sicily to the number of his provinces; and before
he died, in the fulness of years and of glory, he beheld the final
extinction of the empire of the West. [90]

[Footnote 87: This promontory is forty miles from Carthage, (Procop. l.
i. c. 6, p. 192,) and twenty leagues from Sicily, (Shaw's Travels, p.
89.) Scipio landed farther in the bay, at the fair promontory; see the
animated description of Livy, xxix. 26, 27.]

[Footnote 88: Theophanes (p. 100) affirms that many ships of the Vandals
were sunk. The assertion of Jornandes, (de Successione Regn.,) that
Basiliscus attacked Carthage, must be understood in a very qualified
sense]

[Footnote 89: Damascius in Vit. Isidor. apud Phot. p. 1048. It will
appear, by comparing the three short chronicles of the times, that
Marcellinus had fought near Carthage, and was killed in Sicily.]

[Footnote 891: According to Lydus, Leo, distracted by this and
the other calamities of his reign, particularly a dreadful fire at
Constantinople, abandoned the palace, like another Orestes, and was
preparing to quit Constantinople forever l iii. c. 44, p. 230.--M.]

[Footnote 90: For the African war, see Procopius, de Bell. (Vandal. l.
i. c. 6, p. 191, 192, 193,) Theophanes, (p. 99, 100, 101,) Cedrenus,
(p. 349, 350,) and Zonaras, (tom. ii. l. xiv. p. 50, 51.) Montesquieu
(Considerations sur la Grandeur, &c., c. xx. tom. iii. p. 497) has made
a judicious observation on the failure of these great naval armaments.]

During his long and active reign, the African monarch had studiously
cultivated the friendship of the Barbarians of Europe, whose arms he
might employ in a seasonable and effectual diversion against the two
empires. After the death of Attila, he renewed his alliance with the
Visigoths of Gaul; and the sons of the elder Theodoric, who successively
reigned over that warlike nation, were easily persuaded, by the sense
of interest, to forget the cruel affront which Genseric had inflicted on
their sister. [91] The death of the emperor Majorian delivered Theodoric
the Second from the restraint of fear, and perhaps of honor; he violated
his recent treaty with the Romans; and the ample territory of Narbonne,
which he firmly united to his dominions, became the immediate reward of
his perfidy. The selfish policy of Ricimer encouraged him to invade the
provinces which were in the possession of Aegidius, his rival; but the
active count, by the defence of Arles, and the victory of Orleans, saved
Gaul, and checked, during his lifetime, the progress of the Visigoths.
Their ambition was soon rekindled; and the design of extinguishing the
Roman empire in Spain and Gaul was conceived, and almost completed,
in the reign of Euric, who assassinated his brother Theodoric, and
displayed, with a more savage temper, superior abilities, both in peace
and war. He passed the Pyrenees at the head of a numerous army, subdued
the cities of Saragossa and Pampeluna, vanquished in battle the martial
nobles of the Tarragonese province, carried his victorious arms into
the heart of Lusitania, and permitted the Suevi to hold the kingdom of
Gallicia under the Gothic monarchy of Spain. [92] The efforts of Euric
were not less vigorous, or less successful, in Gaul; and throughout the
country that extends from the Pyrenees to the Rhone and the Loire,
Berry and Auvergne were the only cities, or dioceses, which refused to
acknowledge him as their master. [93] In the defence of Clermont, their
principal town, the inhabitants of Auvergne sustained, with inflexible
resolution, the miseries of war, pestilence, and famine; and the
Visigoths, relinquishing the fruitless siege, suspended the hopes of
that important conquest. The youth of the province were animated by the
heroic, and almost incredible, valor of Ecdicius, the son of the emperor
Avitus, [94] who made a desperate sally with only eighteen horsemen,
boldly attacked the Gothic army, and, after maintaining a flying
skirmish, retired safe and victorious within the walls of Clermont. His
charity was equal to his courage: in a time of extreme scarcity, four
thousand poor were fed at his expense; and his private influence levied
an army of Burgundians for the deliverance of Auvergne. From his virtues
alone the faithful citizens of Gaul derived any hopes of safety or
freedom; and even such virtues were insufficient to avert the impending
ruin of their country, since they were anxious to learn, from his
authority and example, whether they should prefer the alternative of
exile or servitude. [95] The public confidence was lost; the resources
of the state were exhausted; and the Gauls had too much reason to
believe, that Anthemius, who reigned in Italy, was incapable of
protecting his distressed subjects beyond the Alps. The feeble emperor
could only procure for their defence the service of twelve thousand
British auxiliaries. Riothamus, one of the independent kings, or
chieftains, of the island, was persuaded to transport his troops to the
continent of Gaul: he sailed up the Loire, and established his quarters
in Berry, where the people complained of these oppressive allies, till
they were destroyed or dispersed by the arms of the Visigoths. [96]

[Footnote 91: Jornandes is our best guide through the reigns of
Theodoric II. and Euric, (de Rebus Geticis, c. 44, 45, 46, 47, p.
675-681.) Idatius ends too soon, and Isidore is too sparing of the
information which he might have given on the affairs of Spain. The
events that relate to Gaul are laboriously illustrated in the third book
of the Abbe Dubos, Hist. Critique, tom. i. p. 424-620.]

[Footnote 92: See Mariana, Hist. Hispan. tom. i. l. v. c. 5. p. 162.]

[Footnote 93: An imperfect, but original, picture of Gaul, more
especially of Auvergne, is shown by Sidonius; who, as a senator,
and afterwards as a bishop, was deeply interested in the fate of his
country. See l. v. epist. 1, 5, 9, &c.]

[Footnote 94: Sidonius, l. iii. epist. 3, p. 65-68. Greg. Turon. l. ii.
c. 24, in tom. ii. p. 174. Jornandes, c. 45, p. 675. Perhaps Ecdicius
was only the son-in-law of Avitus, his wife's son by another husband.]

[Footnote 95: Si nullae a republica vires, nulla praesidia; si nullae,
quantum rumor est, Anthemii principis opes; statuit, te auctore,
nobilitas, seu patriaca dimittere seu capillos, (Sidon. l. ii. epist.
1, p. 33.) The last words Sirmond, (Not. p. 25) may likewise denote the
clerical tonsure, which was indeed the choice of Sidonius himself.]

[Footnote 96: The history of these Britons may be traced in Jornandes,
(c. 45, p. 678,) Sidonius, (l. iii. epistol. 9, p. 73, 74,) and Gregory
of Tours, (l. ii. c. 18, in tom. ii. p. 170.) Sidonius (who styles these
mercenary troops argutos, armatos, tumultuosos, virtute numero, contul
ernio, contumaces) addresses their general in a tone of friendship and
familiarity.] One of the last acts of jurisdiction, which the Roman
senate exercised over their subjects of Gaul, was the trial and
condemnation of Arvandus, the Praetorian praefect. Sidonius, who
rejoices that he lived under a reign in which he might pity and assist
a state criminal, has expressed, with tenderness and freedom, the faults
of his indiscreet and unfortunate friend. [97] From the perils which he
had escaped, Arvandus imbibed confidence rather than wisdom; and such
was the various, though uniform, imprudence of his behavior, that his
prosperity must appear much more surprising than his downfall. The
second praefecture, which he obtained within the term of five years,
abolished the merit and popularity of his preceding administration. His
easy temper was corrupted by flattery, and exasperated by opposition; he
was forced to satisfy his importunate creditors with the spoils of the
province; his capricious insolence offended the nobles of Gaul, and he
sunk under the weight of the public hatred. The mandate of his disgrace
summoned him to justify his conduct before the senate; and he passed
the Sea of Tuscany with a favorable wind, the presage, as he vainly
imagined, of his future fortunes. A decent respect was still observed
for the Proefectorian rank; and on his arrival at Rome, Arvandus was
committed to the hospitality, rather than to the custody, of Flavius
Asellus, the count of the sacred largesses, who resided in the Capitol.
[98] He was eagerly pursued by his accusers, the four deputies of Gaul,
who were all distinguished by their birth, their dignities, or their
eloquence. In the name of a great province, and according to the forms
of Roman jurisprudence, they instituted a civil and criminal
action, requiring such restitution as might compensate the losses of
individuals, and such punishment as might satisfy the justice of the
state. Their charges of corrupt oppression were numerous and weighty;
but they placed their secret dependence on a letter which they had
intercepted, and which they could prove, by the evidence of his
secretary, to have been dictated by Arvandus himself. The author of this
letter seemed to dissuade the king of the Goths from a peace with the
Greek emperor: he suggested the attack of the Britons on the Loire;
and he recommended a division of Gaul, according to the law of nations,
between the Visigoths and the Burgundians. [99] These pernicious
schemes, which a friend could only palliate by the reproaches of vanity
and indiscretion, were susceptible of a treasonable interpretation; and
the deputies had artfully resolved not to produce their most formidable
weapons till the decisive moment of the contest. But their intentions
were discovered by the zeal of Sidonius. He immediately apprised the
unsuspecting criminal of his danger; and sincerely lamented, without any
mixture of anger, the haughty presumption of Arvandus, who rejected, and
even resented, the salutary advice of his friends. Ignorant of his real
situation, Arvandus showed himself in the Capitol in the white robe of
a candidate, accepted indiscriminate salutations and offers of service,
examined the shops of the merchants, the silks and gems, sometimes with
the indifference of a spectator, and sometimes with the attention of a
purchaser; and complained of the times, of the senate, of the prince,
and of the delays of justice. His complaints were soon removed. An early
day was fixed for his trial; and Arvandus appeared, with his accusers,
before a numerous assembly of the Roman senate. The mournful garb
which they affected, excited the compassion of the judges, who were
scandalized by the gay and splendid dress of their adversary: and when
the praefect Arvandus, with the first of the Gallic deputies, were
directed to take their places on the senatorial benches, the same
contrast of pride and modesty was observed in their behavior. In this
memorable judgment, which presented a lively image of the old republic,
the Gauls exposed, with force and freedom, the grievances of the
province; and as soon as the minds of the audience were sufficiently
inflamed, they recited the fatal epistle. The obstinacy of Arvandus
was founded on the strange supposition, that a subject could not be
convicted of treason, unless he had actually conspired to assume the
purple. As the paper was read, he repeatedly, and with a loud voice,
acknowledged it for his genuine composition; and his astonishment was
equal to his dismay, when the unanimous voice of the senate declared him
guilty of a capital offence. By their decree, he was degraded from
the rank of a praefect to the obscure condition of a plebeian, and
ignominiously dragged by servile hands to the public prison. After a
fortnight's adjournment, the senate was again convened to pronounce
the sentence of his death; but while he expected, in the Island of
Aesculapius, the expiration of the thirty days allowed by an ancient
law to the vilest malefactors, [100] his friends interposed, the
emperor Anthemius relented, and the praefect of Gaul obtained the milder
punishment of exile and confiscation. The faults of Arvandus might
deserve compassion; but the impunity of Seronatus accused the justice
of the republic, till he was condemned and executed, on the complaint
of the people of Auvergne. That flagitious minister, the Catiline of
his age and country, held a secret correspondence with the Visigoths,
to betray the province which he oppressed: his industry was continually
exercised in the discovery of new taxes and obsolete offences; and his
extravagant vices would have inspired contempt, if they had not excited
fear and abhorrence. [101]

[Footnote 97: See Sidonius, l. i. epist. 7, p. 15-20, with Sirmond's
notes. This letter does honor to his heart, as well as to his
understanding. The prose of Sidonius, however vitiated by a false and
affected taste, is much superior to his insipid verses.]

[Footnote 98: When the Capitol ceased to be a temple, it was
appropriated to the use of the civil magistrate; and it is still the
residence of the Roman senator. The jewellers, &c., might be allowed to
expose then precious wares in the porticos.]

[Footnote 99: Haec ad regem Gothorum, charta videbatur emitti, pacem cum
Graeco Imperatore dissuadens, Britannos super Ligerim sitos impugnari
oportere, demonstrans, cum Burgundionibus jure gentium Gallias dividi
debere confirmans.]

[Footnote 100: Senatusconsultum Tiberianum, (Sirmond Not. p. 17;) but
that law allowed only ten days between the sentence and execution; the
remaining twenty were added in the reign of Theodosius.]

[Footnote 101: Catilina seculi nostri. Sidonius, l. ii. epist. 1, p.
33; l. v. epist 13, p. 143; l. vii. epist. vii. p. 185. He execrates
the crimes, and applauds the punishment, of Seronatus, perhaps with
the indignation of a virtuous citizen, perhaps with the resentment of a
personal enemy.]

Such criminals were not beyond the reach of justice; but whatever might
be the guilt of Ricimer, that powerful Barbarian was able to contend
or to negotiate with the prince, whose alliance he had condescended to
accept. The peaceful and prosperous reign which Anthemius had promised
to the West, was soon clouded by misfortune and discord. Ricimer,
apprehensive, or impatient, of a superior, retired from Rome, and fixed
his residence at Milan; an advantageous situation either to invite or
to repel the warlike tribes that were seated between the Alps and the
Danube. [102] Italy was gradually divided into two independent and
hostile kingdoms; and the nobles of Liguria, who trembled at the near
approach of a civil war, fell prostrate at the feet of the patrician,
and conjured him to spare their unhappy country. "For my own part,"
replied Ricimer, in a tone of insolent moderation, "I am still inclined
to embrace the friendship of the Galatian; [103] but who will undertake
to appease his anger, or to mitigate the pride, which always rises
in proportion to our submission?" They informed him, that Epiphanius,
bishop of Pavia, [104] united the wisdom of the serpent with the
innocence of the dove; and appeared confident, that the eloquence of
such an ambassador must prevail against the strongest opposition,
either of interest or passion. Their recommendation was approved; and
Epiphanius, assuming the benevolent office of mediation, proceeded
without delay to Rome, where he was received with the honors due to his
merit and reputation. The oration of a bishop in favor of peace may be
easily supposed; he argued, that, in all possible circumstances, the
forgiveness of injuries must be an act of mercy, or magnanimity, or
prudence; and he seriously admonished the emperor to avoid a contest
with a fierce Barbarian, which might be fatal to himself, and must
be ruinous to his dominions. Anthemius acknowledged the truth of his
maxims; but he deeply felt, with grief and indignation, the behavior
of Ricimer, and his passion gave eloquence and energy to his discourse.
"What favors," he warmly exclaimed, "have we refused to this ungrateful
man? What provocations have we not endured! Regardless of the majesty of
the purple, I gave my daughter to a Goth; I sacrificed my own blood to
the safety of the republic. The liberality which ought to have secured
the eternal attachment of Ricimer has exasperated him against his
benefactor. What wars has he not excited against the empire! How often
has he instigated and assisted the fury of hostile nations! Shall I now
accept his perfidious friendship? Can I hope that he will respect the
engagements of a treaty, who has already violated the duties of a son?"
But the anger of Anthemius evaporated in these passionate exclamations:
he insensibly yielded to the proposals of Epiphanius; and the bishop
returned to his diocese with the satisfaction of restoring the peace of
Italy, by a reconciliation, [105] of which the sincerity and continuance
might be reasonably suspected. The clemency of the emperor was extorted
from his weakness; and Ricimer suspended his ambitious designs till he
had secretly prepared the engines with which he resolved to subvert the
throne of Anthemius. The mask of peace and moderation was then thrown
aside. The army of Ricimer was fortified by a numerous reenforcement of
Burgundians and Oriental Suevi: he disclaimed all allegiance to the
Greek emperor, marched from Milan to the Gates of Rome, and fixing his
camp on the banks of the Anio, impatiently expected the arrival of
Olybrius, his Imperial candidate.

[Footnote 102: Ricimer, under the reign of Anthemius, defeated and slew
in battle Beorgor, king of the Alani, (Jornandes, c. 45, p. 678.) His
sister had married the king of the Burgundians, and he maintained an
intimate connection with the Suevic colony established in Pannonia and
Noricum.]

[Footnote 103: Galatam concitatum. Sirmond (in his notes to Ennodius)
applies this appellation to Anthemius himself. The emperor was probably
born in the province of Galatia, whose inhabitants, the Gallo-Grecians,
were supposed to unite the vices of a savage and a corrupted people.]

[Footnote 104: Epiphanius was thirty years bishop of Pavia, (A.D.
467-497;) see Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom. xvi. p. 788. His name and
actions would have been unknown to posterity, if Ennodius, one of
his successors, had not written his life; (Sirmond, Opera tom. i. p.
1647-1692;) in which he represents him as one of the greatest characters
of the age]

[Footnote 105: Ennodius (p. 1659-1664) has related this embassy of
Epiphanius; and his narrative, verbose and turgid as it must appear,
illustrates some curious passages in the fall of the Western empire.]

The senator Olybrius, of the Anician family, might esteem himself the
lawful heir of the Western empire. He had married Placidia, the younger
daughter of Valentinian, after she was restored by Genseric; who still
detained her sister Eudoxia, as the wife, or rather as the captive,
of his son. The king of the Vandals supported, by threats and
solicitations, the fair pretensions of his Roman ally; and assigned, as
one of the motives of the war, the refusal of the senate and people to
acknowledge their lawful prince, and the unworthy preference which they
had given to a stranger. [106] The friendship of the public enemy might
render Olybrius still more unpopular to the Italians; but when Ricimer
meditated the ruin of the emperor Anthemius, he tempted, with the
offer of a diadem, the candidate who could justify his rebellion by an
illustrious name and a royal alliance. The husband of Placidia, who,
like most of his ancestors, had been invested with the consular dignity,
might have continued to enjoy a secure and splendid fortune in the
peaceful residence of Constantinople; nor does he appear to have been
tormented by such a genius as cannot be amused or occupied, unless
by the administration of an empire. Yet Olybrius yielded to the
importunities of his friends, perhaps of his wife; rashly plunged
into the dangers and calamities of a civil war; and, with the secret
connivance of the emperor Leo, accepted the Italian purple, which was
bestowed, and resumed, at the capricious will of a Barbarian. He landed
without obstacle (for Genseric was master of the sea) either at Ravenna,
or the port of Ostia, and immediately proceeded to the camp of Ricimer,
where he was received as the sovereign of the Western world. [107]

[Footnote 106: Priscus, Excerpt. Legation p. 74. Procopius de Bell.
Vandel l. i. c. 6, p. 191. Eudoxia and her daughter were restored after
the death of Majorian. Perhaps the consulship of Olybrius (A.D. 464) was
bestowed as a nuptial present.]

[Footnote 107: The hostile appearance of Olybrius is fixed
(notwithstanding the opinion of Pagi) by the duration of his reign. The
secret connivance of Leo is acknowledged by Theophanes and the Paschal
Chronicle. We are ignorant of his motives; but in this obscure period,
our ignorance extends to the most public and important facts.]

The patrician, who had extended his posts from the Anio to the Melvian
bridge, already possessed two quarters of Rome, the Vatican and the
Janiculum, which are separated by the Tyber from the rest of the city;
[108] and it may be conjectured, that an assembly of seceding senators
imitated, in the choice of Olybrius, the forms of a legal election.
But the body of the senate and people firmly adhered to the cause of
Anthemius; and the more effectual support of a Gothic army enabled him
to prolong his reign, and the public distress, by a resistance of three
months, which produced the concomitant evils of famine and pestilence.
At length Ricimer made a furious assault on the bridge of Hadrian, or
St. Angelo; and the narrow pass was defended with equal valor by the
Goths, till the death of Gilimer, their leader. The victorious troops,
breaking down every barrier, rushed with irresistible violence into
the heart of the city, and Rome (if we may use the language of a
contemporary pope) was subverted by the civil fury of Anthemius
and Ricimer. [109] The unfortunate Anthemius was dragged from his
concealment, and inhumanly massacred by the command of his son-in-law;
who thus added a third, or perhaps a fourth, emperor to the number of
his victims. The soldiers, who united the rage of factious citizens with
the savage manners of Barbarians, were indulged, without control, in
the license of rapine and murder: the crowd of slaves and plebeians,
who were unconcerned in the event, could only gain by the indiscriminate
pillage; and the face of the city exhibited the strange contrast of
stern cruelty and dissolute intemperance. [110] Forty days after this
calamitous event, the subject, not of glory, but of guilt, Italy was
delivered, by a painful disease, from the tyrant Ricimer, who bequeathed
the command of his army to his nephew Gundobald, one of the princes of
the Burgundians. In the same year all the principal actors in this great
revolution were removed from the stage; and the whole reign of Olybrius,
whose death does not betray any symptoms of violence, is included within
the term of seven months. He left one daughter, the offspring of
his marriage with Placidia; and the family of the great Theodosius,
transplanted from Spain to Constantinople, was propagated in the female
line as far as the eighth generation. [111]

[Footnote 108: Of the fourteen regions, or quarters, into which Rome was
divided by Augustus, only one, the Janiculum, lay on the Tuscan side
of the Tyber. But, in the fifth century, the Vatican suburb formed a
considerable city; and in the ecclesiastical distribution, which had
been recently made by Simplicius, the reigning pope, two of the seven
regions, or parishes of Rome, depended on the church of St. Peter. See
Nardini Roma Antica, p. 67. It would require a tedious dissertation
to mark the circumstances, in which I am inclined to depart from the
topography of that learned Roman.]

[Footnote 109: Nuper Anthemii et Ricimeris civili furore subversa est.
Gelasius in Epist. ad Andromach. apud Baron. A.D. 496, No. 42, Sigonius
(tom. i. l. xiv. de Occidentali Imperio, p. 542, 543,) and Muratori
(Annali d'Italia, tom. iv. p. 308, 309,) with the aid of a less
imperfect Ms. of the Historia Miscella., have illustrated this dark and
bloody transaction.]

[Footnote 110: Such had been the saeva ac deformis urbe tota facies,
when Rome was assaulted and stormed by the troops of Vespasian, (see
Tacit. Hist. iii. 82, 83;) and every cause of mischief had since
acquired much additional energy. The revolution of ages may bring round
the same calamities; but ages may revolve without producing a Tacitus to
describe them.]

who appears to have married the niece of the emperor Justinian, was the
eighth descendant of the elder Theodosius.]
