## Chapter LV: The Bulgarians, The Hungarians And The Russians.--Part III.

But the same communication which had been opened for the benefit, was
soon abused for the injury, of mankind. In a period of one hundred and
ninety years, the Russians made four attempts to plunder the treasures
of Constantinople: the event was various, but the motive, the means, and
the object, were the same in these naval expeditions. [56] The Russian
traders had seen the magnificence, and tasted the luxury of the city of
the Caesars. A marvellous tale, and a scanty supply, excited the desires
of their savage countrymen: they envied the gifts of nature which their
climate denied; they coveted the works of art, which they were too lazy
to imitate and too indigent to purchase; the Varangian princes unfurled
the banners of piratical adventure, and their bravest soldiers were
drawn from the nations that dwelt in the northern isles of the ocean.
[57] The image of their naval armaments was revived in the last century,
in the fleets of the Cossacks, which issued from the Borysthenes, to
navigate the same seas for a similar purpose. [58] The Greek appellation
of monoxyla, or single canoes, might justly be applied to the bottom of
their vessels. It was scooped out of the long stem of a beech or willow,
but the slight and narrow foundation was raised and continued on either
side with planks, till it attained the length of sixty, and the height
of about twelve, feet. These boats were built without a deck, but with
two rudders and a mast; to move with sails and oars; and to contain from
forty to seventy men, with their arms, and provisions of fresh water
and salt fish. The first trial of the Russians was made with two hundred
boats; but when the national force was exerted, they might arm against
Constantinople a thousand or twelve hundred vessels. Their fleet was not
much inferior to the royal navy of Agamemnon, but it was magnified in
the eyes of fear to ten or fifteen times the real proportion of its
strength and numbers. Had the Greek emperors been endowed with foresight
to discern, and vigor to prevent, perhaps they might have sealed with a
maritime force the mouth of the Borysthenes. Their indolence abandoned
the coast of Anatolia to the calamities of a piratical war, which, after
an interval of six hundred years, again infested the Euxine; but as
long as the capital was respected, the sufferings of a distant province
escaped the notice both of the prince and the historian. The storm which
had swept along from the Phasis and Trebizond, at length burst on
the Bosphorus of Thrace; a strait of fifteen miles, in which the rude
vessels of the Russians might have been stopped and destroyed by a more
skilful adversary. In their first enterprise [59] under the princes
of Kiow, they passed without opposition, and occupied the port of
Constantinople in the absence of the emperor Michael, the son of
Theophilus. Through a crowd of perils, he landed at the palace-stairs,
and immediately repaired to a church of the Virgin Mary. [60] By the
advice of the patriarch, her garment, a precious relic, was drawn from
the sanctuary and dipped in the sea; and a seasonable tempest, which
determined the retreat of the Russians, was devoutly ascribed to the
mother of God. [61] The silence of the Greeks may inspire some doubt of
the truth, or at least of the importance, of the second attempt by Oleg,
the guardian of the sons of Ruric. [62] A strong barrier of arms and
fortifications defended the Bosphorus: they were eluded by the usual
expedient of drawing the boats over the isthmus; and this simple
operation is described in the national chronicles, as if the Russian
fleet had sailed over dry land with a brisk and favorable gale. The
leader of the third armament, Igor, the son of Ruric, had chosen a
moment of weakness and decay, when the naval powers of the empire
were employed against the Saracens. But if courage be not wanting, the
instruments of defence are seldom deficient. Fifteen broken and decayed
galleys were boldly launched against the enemy; but instead of the
single tube of Greek fire usually planted on the prow, the sides
and stern of each vessel were abundantly supplied with that liquid
combustible. The engineers were dexterous; the weather was propitious;
many thousand Russians, who chose rather to be drowned than burnt,
leaped into the sea; and those who escaped to the Thracian shore were
inhumanly slaughtered by the peasants and soldiers. Yet one third of the
canoes escaped into shallow water; and the next spring Igor was again
prepared to retrieve his disgrace and claim his revenge. [63] After
a long peace, Jaroslaus, the great grandson of Igor, resumed the same
project of a naval invasion. A fleet, under the command of his son, was
repulsed at the entrance of the Bosphorus by the same artificial
flames. But in the rashness of pursuit, the vanguard of the Greeks
was encompassed by an irresistible multitude of boats and men; their
provision of fire was probably exhausted; and twenty-four galleys were
either taken, sunk, or destroyed. [64]

Yet the threats or calamities of a Russian war were more frequently
diverted by treaty than by arms. In these naval hostilities, every
disadvantage was on the side of the Greeks; their savage enemy afforded
no mercy: his poverty promised no spoil; his impenetrable retreat
deprived the conqueror of the hopes of revenge; and the pride or
weakness of empire indulged an opinion, that no honor could be gained
or lost in the intercourse with Barbarians. At first their demands were
high and inadmissible, three pounds of gold for each soldier or mariner
of the fleet: the Russian youth adhered to the design of conquest and
glory; but the counsels of moderation were recommended by the hoary
sages. "Be content," they said, "with the liberal offers of Caesar; it
is not far better to obtain without a combat the possession of gold,
silver, silks, and all the objects of our desires? Are we sure of
victory? Can we conclude a treaty with the sea? We do not tread on the
land; we float on the abyss of water, and a common death hangs over our
heads." [65] The memory of these Arctic fleets that seemed to descend
from the polar circle left deep impression of terror on the Imperial
city. By the vulgar of every rank, it was asserted and believed, that an
equestrian statue in the square of Taurus was secretly inscribed with a
prophecy, how the Russians, in the last days, should become masters of
Constantinople. [66] In our own time, a Russian armament, instead of
sailing from the Borysthenes, has circumnavigated the continent of
Europe; and the Turkish capital has been threatened by a squadron of
strong and lofty ships of war, each of which, with its naval science
and thundering artillery, could have sunk or scattered a hundred canoes,
such as those of their ancestors. Perhaps the present generation may yet
behold the accomplishment of the prediction, of a rare prediction, of
which the style is unambiguous and the date unquestionable.

[Footnote 65: Nestor, apud Leveque, Hist. de Russie, tom. i. p. 87.]

[Footnote 66: This brazen statue, which had been brought from Antioch,
and was melted down by the Latins, was supposed to represent either
Joshua or Bellerophon, an odd dilemma. See Nicetas Choniates, (p. 413,
414,) Codinus, (de Originibus C. P. p. 24,) and the anonymous writer de
Antiquitat. C. P. (Banduri, Imp. Orient. tom. i. p. 17, 18,) who lived
about the year 1100. They witness the belief of the prophecy the rest is
immaterial.]

By land the Russians were less formidable than by sea; and as they
fought for the most part on foot, their irregular legions must often
have been broken and overthrown by the cavalry of the Scythian hordes.
Yet their growing towns, however slight and imperfect, presented a
shelter to the subject, and a barrier to the enemy: the monarchy of
Kiow, till a fatal partition, assumed the dominion of the North; and
the nations from the Volga to the Danube were subdued or repelled by the
arms of Swatoslaus, [67] the son of Igor, the son of Oleg, the son of
Ruric. The vigor of his mind and body was fortified by the hardships of
a military and savage life. Wrapped in a bear-skin, Swatoslaus usually
slept on the ground, his head reclining on a saddle; his diet was coarse
and frugal, and, like the heroes of Homer, [68] his meat (it was often
horse-flesh) was broiled or roasted on the coals. The exercise of war
gave stability and discipline to his army; and it may be presumed, that
no soldier was permitted to transcend the luxury of his chief. By an
embassy from Nicephorus, the Greek emperor, he was moved to undertake
the conquest of Bulgaria; and a gift of fifteen hundred pounds of gold
was laid at his feet to defray the expense, or reward the toils, of the
expedition. An army of sixty thousand men was assembled and embarked;
they sailed from the Borysthenes to the Danube; their landing was
effected on the Maesian shore; and, after a sharp encounter, the swords
of the Russians prevailed against the arrows of the Bulgarian horse. The
vanquished king sunk into the grave; his children were made captive; and
his dominions, as far as Mount Haemus, were subdued or ravaged by the
northern invaders. But instead of relinquishing his prey, and performing
his engagements, the Varangian prince was more disposed to advance than
to retire; and, had his ambition been crowned with success, the seat
of empire in that early period might have been transferred to a more
temperate and fruitful climate. Swatoslaus enjoyed and acknowledged the
advantages of his new position, in which he could unite, by exchange or
rapine, the various productions of the earth. By an easy navigation
he might draw from Russia the native commodities of furs, wax, and
hydromed: Hungary supplied him with a breed of horses and the spoils
of the West; and Greece abounded with gold, silver, and the foreign
luxuries, which his poverty had affected to disdain. The bands of
Patzinacites, Chozars, and Turks, repaired to the standard of victory;
and the ambassador of Nicephorus betrayed his trust, assumed the purple,
and promised to share with his new allies the treasures of the Eastern
world. From the banks of the Danube the Russian prince pursued his march
as far as Adrianople; a formal summons to evacuate the Roman province
was dismissed with contempt; and Swatoslaus fiercely replied, that
Constantinople might soon expect the presence of an enemy and a master.

[Footnote 67: The life of Swatoslaus, or Sviatoslaf, or Sphendosthlabus,
is extracted from the Russian Chronicles by M. Levesque, (Hist. de
Russie, tom. i. p. 94-107.)]

[Footnote 68: This resemblance may be clearly seen in the ninth book of
the Iliad, (205-221,) in the minute detail of the cookery of Achilles.
By such a picture, a modern epic poet would disgrace his work, and
disgust his reader; but the Greek verses are harmonious--a dead language
can seldom appear low or familiar; and at the distance of two thousand
seven hundred years, we are amused with the primitive manners of
antiquity.]

Nicephorus could no longer expel the mischief which he had introduced;
but his throne and wife were inherited by John Zimisces, [69] who, in a
diminutive body, possessed the spirit and abilities of a hero. The
first victory of his lieutenants deprived the Russians of their foreign
allies, twenty thousand of whom were either destroyed by the sword,
or provoked to revolt, or tempted to desert. Thrace was delivered, but
seventy thousand Barbarians were still in arms; and the legions that had
been recalled from the new conquests of Syria, prepared, with the return
of the spring, to march under the banners of a warlike prince, who
declared himself the friend and avenger of the injured Bulgaria. The
passes of Mount Haemus had been left unguarded; they were instantly
occupied; the Roman vanguard was formed of the immortals, (a proud
imitation of the Persian style;) the emperor led the main body of ten
thousand five hundred foot; and the rest of his forces followed in slow
and cautious array, with the baggage and military engines. The first
exploit of Zimisces was the reduction of Marcianopolis, or Peristhlaba,
[70] in two days; the trumpets sounded; the walls were scaled; eight
thousand five hundred Russians were put to the sword; and the sons of
the Bulgarian king were rescued from an ignominious prison, and invested
with a nominal diadem. After these repeated losses, Swatoslaus retired
to the strong post of Drista, on the banks of the Danube, and was
pursued by an enemy who alternately employed the arms of celerity and
delay. The Byzantine galleys ascended the river, the legions completed
a line of circumvallation; and the Russian prince was encompassed,
assaulted, and famished, in the fortifications of the camp and city.
Many deeds of valor were performed; several desperate sallies were
attempted; nor was it till after a siege of sixty-five days that
Swatoslaus yielded to his adverse fortune. The liberal terms which he
obtained announce the prudence of the victor, who respected the valor,
and apprehended the despair, of an unconquered mind. The great duke of
Russia bound himself, by solemn imprecations, to relinquish all hostile
designs; a safe passage was opened for his return; the liberty of trade
and navigation was restored; a measure of corn was distributed to each
of his soldiers; and the allowance of twenty-two thousand measures
attests the loss and the remnant of the Barbarians. After a painful
voyage, they again reached the mouth of the Borysthenes; but their
provisions were exhausted; the season was unfavorable; they passed
the winter on the ice; and, before they could prosecute their march,
Swatoslaus was surprised and oppressed by the neighboring tribes with
whom the Greeks entertained a perpetual and useful correspondence.
[71] Far different was the return of Zimisces, who was received in his
capital like Camillus or Marius, the saviors of ancient Rome. But the
merit of the victory was attributed by the pious emperor to the mother
of God; and the image of the Virgin Mary, with the divine infant in her
arms, was placed on a triumphal car, adorned with the spoils of war,
and the ensigns of Bulgarian royalty. Zimisces made his public entry on
horseback; the diadem on his head, a crown of laurel in his hand; and
Constantinople was astonished to applaud the martial virtues of her
sovereign. [72]

[Footnote 69: This singular epithet is derived from the Armenian
language. As I profess myself equally ignorant of these words, I may
be indulged in the question in the play, "Pray, which of you is the
interpreter?" From the context, they seem to signify Adolescentulus,
(Leo Diacon l. iv. Ms. apud Ducange, Glossar. Graec. p. 1570.) * Note:
Cerbied. the learned Armenian, gives another derivation. There is a city
called Tschemisch-gaizag, which means a bright or purple sandal, such as
women wear in the East. He was called Tschemisch-ghigh, (for so his name
is written in Armenian, from this city, his native place.) Hase. Note to
Leo Diac. p. 454, in Niebuhr's Byzant. Hist.--M.]

[Footnote 70: In the Sclavonic tongue, the name of Peristhlaba implied
the great or illustrious city, says Anna Comnena, (Alexiad, l. vii. p.
194.) From its position between Mount Haemus and the Lower Danube, it
appears to fill the ground, or at least the station, of Marcianopolis.
The situation of Durostolus, or Dristra, is well known and conspicuous,
(Comment. Academ. Petropol. tom. ix. p. 415, 416. D'Anville, Geographie
Ancienne, tom. i. p. 307, 311.)]

[Footnote 71: The political management of the Greeks, more especially
with the Patzinacites, is explained in the seven first chapters, de
Administratione Imperii.]

[Footnote 72: In the narrative of this war, Leo the Deacon (apud Pagi,
Critica, tom. iv. A.D. 968-973) is more authentic and circumstantial
than Cedrenus (tom. ii. p. 660-683) and Zonaras, (tom. ii. p.
205-214.) These declaimers have multiplied to 308,000 and 330,000 men,
those Russian forces, of which the contemporary had given a moderate and
consistent account.]

Photius of Constantinople, a patriarch, whose ambition was equal to his
curiosity, congratulates himself and the Greek church on the conversion
of the Russians. [73] Those fierce and bloody Barbarians had been
persuaded, by the voice of reason and religion, to acknowledge Jesus for
their God, the Christian missionaries for their teachers, and the Romans
for their friends and brethren. His triumph was transient and premature.
In the various fortune of their piratical adventures, some Russian
chiefs might allow themselves to be sprinkled with the waters of
baptism; and a Greek bishop, with the name of metropolitan, might
administer the sacraments in the church of Kiow, to a congregation of
slaves and natives. But the seed of the gospel was sown on a barren
soil: many were the apostates, the converts were few; and the baptism
of Olga may be fixed as the aera of Russian Christianity. [74] A female,
perhaps of the basest origin, who could revenge the death, and assume
the sceptre, of her husband Igor, must have been endowed with those
active virtues which command the fear and obedience of Barbarians. In
a moment of foreign and domestic peace, she sailed from Kiow to
Constantinople; and the emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus has
described, with minute diligence, the ceremonial of her reception in his
capital and palace. The steps, the titles, the salutations, the banquet,
the presents, were exquisitely adjusted to gratify the vanity of the
stranger, with due reverence to the superior majesty of the purple.
[75] In the sacrament of baptism, she received the venerable name of the
empress Helena; and her conversion might be preceded or followed by her
uncle, two interpreters, sixteen damsels of a higher, and eighteen of
a lower rank, twenty-two domestics or ministers, and forty-four Russian
merchants, who composed the retinue of the great princess Olga. After
her return to Kiow and Novogorod, she firmly persisted in her new
religion; but her labors in the propagation of the gospel were not
crowned with success; and both her family and nation adhered with
obstinacy or indifference to the gods of their fathers. Her son
Swatoslaus was apprehensive of the scorn and ridicule of his companions;
and her grandson Wolodomir devoted his youthful zeal to multiply and
decorate the monuments of ancient worship. The savage deities of the
North were still propitiated with human sacrifices: in the choice of
the victim, a citizen was preferred to a stranger, a Christian to an
idolater; and the father, who defended his son from the sacerdotal
knife, was involved in the same doom by the rage of a fanatic tumult.
Yet the lessons and example of the pious Olga had made a deep, though
secret, impression in the minds of the prince and people: the Greek
missionaries continued to preach, to dispute, and to baptize: and the
ambassadors or merchants of Russia compared the idolatry of the woods
with the elegant superstition of Constantinople. They had gazed with
admiration on the dome of St. Sophia: the lively pictures of saints
and martyrs, the riches of the altar, the number and vestments of the
priests, the pomp and order of the ceremonies; they were edified by the
alternate succession of devout silence and harmonious song; nor was it
difficult to persuade them, that a choir of angels descended each day
from heaven to join in the devotion of the Christians. [76] But the
conversion of Wolodomir was determined, or hastened, by his desire of a
Roman bride. At the same time, and in the city of Cherson, the rites of
baptism and marriage were celebrated by the Christian pontiff: the city
he restored to the emperor Basil, the brother of his spouse; but the
brazen gates were transported, as it is said, to Novogorod, and erected
before the first church as a trophy of his victory and faith. [77] At
his despotic command, Peround, the god of thunder, whom he had so long
adored, was dragged through the streets of Kiow; and twelve sturdy
Barbarians battered with clubs the misshapen image, which was
indignantly cast into the waters of the Borysthenes. The edict of
Wolodomir had proclaimed, that all who should refuse the rites of
baptism would be treated as the enemies of God and their prince; and the
rivers were instantly filled with many thousands of obedient Russians,
who acquiesced in the truth and excellence of a doctrine which had been
embraced by the great duke and his boyars. In the next generation, the
relics of Paganism were finally extirpated; but as the two brothers
of Wolodomir had died without baptism, their bones were taken from the
grave, and sanctified by an irregular and posthumous sacrament.

[Footnote 73: Phot. Epistol. ii. No. 35, p. 58, edit. Montacut. It was
unworthy of the learning of the editor to mistake the Russian nation,
for a war-cry of the Bulgarians, nor did it become the enlightened
patriarch to accuse the Sclavonian idolaters. They were neither Greeks
nor Atheists.]

[Footnote 74: M. Levesque has extracted, from old chronicles and modern
researches, the most satisfactory account of the religion of the Slavi,
and the conversion of Russia, (Hist. de Russie, tom. i. p. 35-54, 59,
92, 92, 113-121, 124-129, 148, 149, &c.)]

[Footnote 75: See the Ceremoniale Aulae Byzant. tom. ii. c. 15, p.
343-345: the style of Olga, or Elga. For the chief of Barbarians the
Greeks whimsically borrowed the title of an Athenian magistrate, with a
female termination, which would have astonished the ear of Demosthenes.]

[Footnote 76: See an anonymous fragment published by Banduri, (Imperium
Orientale, tom. ii. p. 112, 113, de Conversione Russorum.)]

[Footnote 77: Cherson, or Corsun, is mentioned by Herberstein (apud Pagi
tom. iv. p. 56) as the place of Wolodomir's baptism and marriage; and
both the tradition and the gates are still preserved at Novogorod. Yet
an observing traveller transports the brazen gates from Magdeburgh in
Germany, (Coxe's Travels into Russia, &c., vol. i. p. 452;) and quotes
an inscription, which seems to justify his opinion. The modern reader
must not confound this old Cherson of the Tauric or Crimaean peninsula,
with a new city of the same name, which has arisen near the mouth of the
Borysthenes, and was lately honored by the memorable interview of the
empress of Russia with the emperor of the West.]

In the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries of the Christian aera,
the reign of the gospel and of the church was extended over Bulgaria,
Hungary, Bohemia, Saxony, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Poland, and Russia.
[78] The triumphs of apostolic zeal were repeated in the iron age of
Christianity; and the northern and eastern regions of Europe submitted
to a religion, more different in theory than in practice, from the
worship of their native idols. A laudable ambition excited the
monks both of Germany and Greece, to visit the tents and huts of the
Barbarians: poverty, hardships, and dangers, were the lot of the first
missionaries; their courage was active and patient; their motive pure
and meritorious; their present reward consisted in the testimony of
their conscience and the respect of a grateful people; but the fruitful
harvest of their toils was inherited and enjoyed by the proud and
wealthy prelates of succeeding times. The first conversions were free
and spontaneous: a holy life and an eloquent tongue were the only arms
of the missionaries; but the domestic fables of the Pagans were silenced
by the miracles and visions of the strangers; and the favorable temper
of the chiefs was accelerated by the dictates of vanity and interest.
The leaders of nations, who were saluted with the titles of kings and
saints, [79] held it lawful and pious to impose the Catholic faith on
their subjects and neighbors; the coast of the Baltic, from Holstein to
the Gulf of Finland, was invaded under the standard of the cross; and
the reign of idolatry was closed by the conversion of Lithuania in the
fourteenth century. Yet truth and candor must acknowledge, that the
conversion of the North imparted many temporal benefits both to the old
and the new Christians. The rage of war, inherent to the human species,
could not be healed by the evangelic precepts of charity and peace; and
the ambition of Catholic princes has renewed in every age the calamities
of hostile contention. But the admission of the Barbarians into the
pale of civil and ecclesiastical society delivered Europe from the
depredations, by sea and land, of the Normans, the Hungarians, and
the Russians, who learned to spare their brethren and cultivate their
possessions. [80] The establishment of law and order was promoted by
the influence of the clergy; and the rudiments of art and science were
introduced into the savage countries of the globe. The liberal piety
of the Russian princes engaged in their service the most skilful of the
Greeks, to decorate the cities and instruct the inhabitants: the dome
and the paintings of St. Sophia were rudely copied in the churches of
Kiow and Novogorod: the writings of the fathers were translated into
the Sclavonic idiom; and three hundred noble youths were invited or
compelled to attend the lessons of the college of Jaroslaus. It should
appear that Russia might have derived an early and rapid improvement
from her peculiar connection with the church and state of
Constantinople, which at that age so justly despised the ignorance of
the Latins. But the Byzantine nation was servile, solitary, and verging
to a hasty decline: after the fall of Kiow, the navigation of the
Borysthenes was forgotten; the great princes of Wolodomir and Moscow
were separated from the sea and Christendom; and the divided monarchy
was oppressed by the ignominy and blindness of Tartar servitude. [81]
The Sclavonic and Scandinavian kingdoms, which had been converted by
the Latin missionaries, were exposed, it is true, to the spiritual
jurisdiction and temporal claims of the popes; [82] but they were united
in language and religious worship, with each other, and with Rome;
they imbibed the free and generous spirit of the European republic,
and gradually shared the light of knowledge which arose on the western
world.

excellent History of the Church, under the first head or section of each

[Footnote 79: In the year 1000, the ambassadors of St. Stephen received
from Pope Silvester the title of King of Hungary, with a diadem of Greek
workmanship. It had been designed for the duke of Poland: but the Poles,
by their own confession, were yet too barbarous to deserve an angelical
and apostolical crown. (Katona, Hist. Critic Regum Stirpis Arpadianae,
tom. i. p. 1-20.)]

expressions of regnum oblatum, debitam obedientiam, &c., which were most
rigorously interpreted by Gregory VII.; and the Hungarian Catholics are
distressed between the sanctity of the pope and the independence of the
crown, (Katona, Hist. Critica, tom. i. p. 20-25, tom. ii. p. 304, 346,
