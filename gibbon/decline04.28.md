## Chapter XLIV: Idea Of The Roman Jurisprudence.--Part VII.

1. The goddess of faith (of human and social faith) was worshipped, not
only in her temples, but in the lives of the Romans; and if that
nation was deficient in the more amiable qualities of benevolence and
generosity, they astonished the Greeks by their sincere and simple
performance of the most burdensome engagements. [159] Yet among the same
people, according to the rigid maxims of the patricians and decemvirs,
a naked pact, a promise, or even an oath, did not create any civil
obligation, unless it was confirmed by the legal form of a stipulation.
Whatever might be the etymology of the Latin word, it conveyed the idea
of a firm and irrevocable contract, which was always expressed in the
mode of a question and answer. Do you promise to pay me one hundred
pieces of gold? was the solemn interrogation of Seius. I do promise, was
the reply of Sempronius. The friends of Sempronius, who answered for
his ability and inclination, might be separately sued at the option of
Seius; and the benefit of partition, or order of reciprocal actions,
insensibly deviated from the strict theory of stipulation. The most
cautious and deliberate consent was justly required to sustain the
validity of a gratuitous promise; and the citizen who might have
obtained a legal security, incurred the suspicion of fraud, and paid the
forfeit of his neglect. But the ingenuity of the civilians successfully
labored to convert simple engagements into the form of solemn
stipulations. The praetors, as the guardians of social faith, admitted
every rational evidence of a voluntary and deliberate act, which in
their tribunal produced an equitable obligation, and for which they gave
an action and a remedy. [160]

[Footnote 159: How much is the cool, rational evidence of Polybius (l.
vi. p. 693, l. xxxi. p. 1459, 1460) superior to vague, indiscriminate
applause--omnium maxime et praecipue fidem coluit, (A. Gellius, xx. l.)]

[Footnote 160: The Jus Praetorium de Pactis et Transactionibus is a
separate and satisfactory treatise of Gerard Noodt, (Opp. tom. i. p.
483--564.) And I will here observe, that the universities of Holland
and Brandenburg, in the beginning of the present century, appear to have
studied the civil law on the most just and liberal principles. * Note:
Simple agreements (pacta) formed as valid an obligation as a solemn
contract. Only an action, or the right to a direct judicial prosecution,
was not permitted in every case of compact. In all other respects, the
judge was bound to maintain an agreement made by pactum. The stipulation
was a form common to every kind of agreement, by which the right of
action was given to this.--W.]

2. The obligations of the second class, as they were contracted by the
delivery of a thing, are marked by the civilians with the epithet of
real. [161] A grateful return is due to the author of a benefit; and
whoever is intrusted with the property of another, has bound himself
to the sacred duty of restitution. In the case of a friendly loan, the
merit of generosity is on the side of the lender only; in a deposit, on
the side of the receiver; but in a pledge, and the rest of the selfish
commerce of ordinary life, the benefit is compensated by an equivalent,
and the obligation to restore is variously modified by the nature of the
transaction. The Latin language very happily expresses the fundamental
difference between the commodatum and the mutuum, which our poverty is
reduced to confound under the vague and common appellation of a loan.
In the former, the borrower was obliged to restore the same individual
thing with which he had been accommodated for the temporary supply of
his wants; in the latter, it was destined for his use and consumption,
and he discharged this mutual engagement, by substituting the same
specific value according to a just estimation of number, of weight,
and of measure. In the contract of sale, the absolute dominion is
transferred to the purchaser, and he repays the benefit with an adequate
sum of gold or silver, the price and universal standard of all earthly
possessions. The obligation of another contract, that of location, is of
a more complicated kind. Lands or houses, labor or talents, may be hired
for a definite term; at the expiration of the time, the thing itself
must be restored to the owner, with an additional reward for the
beneficial occupation and employment. In these lucrative contracts, to
which may be added those of partnership and commissions, the civilians
sometimes imagine the delivery of the object, and sometimes presume the
consent of the parties. The substantial pledge has been refined into the
invisible rights of a mortgage or hypotheca; and the agreement of sale,
for a certain price, imputes, from that moment, the chances of gain or
loss to the account of the purchaser. It may be fairly supposed, that
every man will obey the dictates of his interest; and if he accepts the
benefit, he is obliged to sustain the expense, of the transaction. In
this boundless subject, the historian will observe the location of land
and money, the rent of the one and the interest of the other, as they
materially affect the prosperity of agriculture and commerce. The
landlord was often obliged to advance the stock and instruments of
husbandry, and to content himself with a partition of the fruits. If the
feeble tenant was oppressed by accident, contagion, or hostile violence,
he claimed a proportionable relief from the equity of the laws: five
years were the customary term, and no solid or costly improvements could
be expected from a farmer, who, at each moment might be ejected by the
sale of the estate. [162] Usury, [163] the inveterate grievance of the
city, had been discouraged by the Twelve Tables, [164] and abolished by
the clamors of the people. It was revived by their wants and idleness,
tolerated by the discretion of the praetors, and finally determined by
the Code of Justinian. Persons of illustrious rank were confined to the
moderate profit of four per cent.; six was pronounced to be the ordinary
and legal standard of interest; eight was allowed for the convenience
of manufactures and merchants; twelve was granted to nautical insurance,
which the wiser ancients had not attempted to define; but, except in
this perilous adventure, the practice of exorbitant usury was severely
restrained. [165] The most simple interest was condemned by the clergy
of the East and West; [166] but the sense of mutual benefit, which had
triumphed over the law of the republic, has resisted with equal firmness
the decrees of the church, and even the prejudices of mankind. [167]

[Footnote 161: The nice and various subject of contracts by consent is
spread over four books (xvii.--xx.) of the Pandects, and is one of the
parts best deserving of the attention of an English student. * Note:
This is erroneously called "benefits." Gibbon enumerates various kinds
of contracts, of which some alone are properly called benefits.--W.]

[Footnote 162: The covenants of rent are defined in the Pandects (l.
xix.) and the Code, (l. iv. tit. lxv.) The quinquennium, or term of five
years, appears to have been a custom rather than a law; but in France
all leases of land were determined in nine years. This limitation was
removed only in the year 1775, (Encyclopedie Methodique, tom. i. de
la Jurisprudence, p. 668, 669;) and I am sorry to observe that it yet
prevails in the beauteous and happy country where I am permitted to
reside.]

[Footnote 163: I might implicitly acquiesce in the sense and learning
of the three books of G. Noodt, de foenore et usuris. (Opp. tom. i.
p. 175--268.) The interpretation of the asses or centesimoe usuroe
at twelve, the unciarioe at one per cent., is maintained by the best
critics and civilians: Noodt, (l. ii. c. 2, p. 207,) Gravina, (Opp. p.
205, &c., 210,) Heineccius, (Antiquitat. ad Institut. l. iii. tit. xv.,)
Montesquieu, (Esprit des Loix, l. xxii. c. 22, tom. ii. p. 36). Defense
de l'Esprit des Loix, (tom. iii. p. 478, &c.,) and above all, John
Frederic Gronovius (de Pecunia Veteri, l. iii. c. 13, p. 213--227,)
and his three Antexegeses, (p. 455--655), the founder, or at least the
champion, of this probable opinion; which is, however, perplexed with
some difficulties.]

[Footnote 164: Primo xii. Tabulis sancitum est ne quis unciario foenore
amplius exerceret, (Tacit. Annal. vi. 16.) Pour peu (says Montesquieu,
Esprit des Loix, l. xxii. 22) qu'on soit verse dans l'histoire de Rome,
on verra qu'une pareille loi ne devoit pas etre l'ouvrage des decemvirs.
Was Tacitus ignorant--or stupid? But the wiser and more virtuous
patricians might sacrifice their avarice to their ambition, and might
attempt to check the odious practice by such interest as no lender would
accept, and such penalties as no debtor would incur. * Note: The real
nature of the foenus unciarium has been proved; it amounted in a year of
twelve months to ten per cent. See, in the Magazine for Civil Law, by M.
Hugo, vol. v. p. 180, 184, an article of M. Schrader, following up the
conjectures of Niebuhr, Hist. Rom. tom. ii. p. 431.--W. Compare a very
clear account of this question in the appendix to Mr. Travers Twiss's
Epitome of Niebuhr, vol. ii. p. 257.--M.]

[Footnote 165: Justinian has not condescended to give usury a place in
his Institutes; but the necessary rules and restrictions are inserted
in the Pandects (l. xxii. tit. i. ii.) and the Code, (l. iv. tit. xxxii.
xxxiii.)]

[Footnote 166: The Fathers are unanimous, (Barbeyrac, Morale des Peres,
p. 144. &c.:) Cyprian, Lactantius, Basil, Chrysostom, (see his frivolous
arguments in Noodt, l. i. c. 7, p. 188,) Gregory of Nyssa, Ambrose,
Jerom, Augustin, and a host of councils and casuists.]

[Footnote 167: Cato, Seneca, Plutarch, have loudly condemned the
practice or abuse of usury. According to the etymology of foenus, the
principal is supposed to generate the interest: a breed of barren metal,
exclaims Shakespeare--and the stage is the echo of the public voice.]

3. Nature and society impose the strict obligation of repairing an
injury; and the sufferer by private injustice acquires a personal right
and a legitimate action. If the property of another be intrusted to our
care, the requisite degree of care may rise and fall according to the
benefit which we derive from such temporary possession; we are seldom
made responsible for inevitable accident, but the consequences of a
voluntary fault must always be imputed to the author. [168] A Roman
pursued and recovered his stolen goods by a civil action of theft; they
might pass through a succession of pure and innocent hands, but nothing
less than a prescription of thirty years could extinguish his original
claim. They were restored by the sentence of the praetor, and the injury
was compensated by double, or threefold, or even quadruple damages, as
the deed had been perpetrated by secret fraud or open rapine, as the
robber had been surprised in the fact, or detected by a subsequent
research. The Aquilian law [169] defended the living property of a
citizen, his slaves and cattle, from the stroke of malice or negligence:
the highest price was allowed that could be ascribed to the domestic
animal at any moment of the year preceding his death; a similar latitude
of thirty days was granted on the destruction of any other valuable
effects. A personal injury is blunted or sharpened by the manners of the
times and the sensibility of the individual: the pain or the disgrace of
a word or blow cannot easily be appreciated by a pecuniary equivalent.
The rude jurisprudence of the decemvirs had confounded all hasty
insults, which did not amount to the fracture of a limb, by condemning
the aggressor to the common penalty of twenty-five asses. But the same
denomination of money was reduced, in three centuries, from a pound
to the weight of half an ounce: and the insolence of a wealthy Roman
indulged himself in the cheap amusement of breaking and satisfying the
law of the twelve tables. Veratius ran through the streets striking
on the face the inoffensive passengers, and his attendant purse-bearer
immediately silenced their clamors by the legal tender of twenty-five
pieces of copper, about the value of one shilling. [170] The equity
of the praetors examined and estimated the distinct merits of each
particular complaint. In the adjudication of civil damages, the
magistrate assumed a right to consider the various circumstances of
time and place, of age and dignity, which may aggravate the shame and
sufferings of the injured person; but if he admitted the idea of a fine,
a punishment, an example, he invaded the province, though, perhaps, he
supplied the defects, of the criminal law. [Footnote 168: Sir William
Jones has given an ingenious and rational Essay on the law of Bailment,
(London, 1781, p. 127, in 8vo.) He is perhaps the only lawyer equally
conversant with the year-books of Westminster, the Commentaries of
Ulpian, the Attic pleadings of Isaeus, and the sentences of Arabian and
Persian cadhis.]

[Footnote 169: Noodt (Opp. tom. i. p. 137--172) has composed a separate
treatise, ad Legem Aquilian, (Pandect. l. ix. tit. ii.)]

[Footnote 170: Aulus Gellius (Noct. Attic. xx. i.) borrowed this story
from the Commentaries of Q. Labeo on the xii. tables.]

The execution of the Alban dictator, who was dismembered by eight
horses, is represented by Livy as the first and the fast instance of
Roman cruelty in the punishment of the most atrocious crimes. [171] But
this act of justice, or revenge, was inflicted on a foreign enemy in the
heat of victory, and at the command of a single man. The twelve tables
afford a more decisive proof of the national spirit, since they were
framed by the wisest of the senate, and accepted by the free voices
of the people; yet these laws, like the statutes of Draco, [172] are
written in characters of blood. [173] They approve the inhuman and
unequal principle of retaliation; and the forfeit of an eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth, a limb for a limb, is rigorously exacted, unless
the offender can redeem his pardon by a fine of three hundred pounds
of copper. The decemvirs distributed with much liberality the slighter
chastisements of flagellation and servitude; and nine crimes of a very
different complexion are adjudged worthy of death.

1. Any act of treason against the state, or of correspondence with the
public enemy. The mode of execution was painful and ignominious: the
head of the degenerate Roman was shrouded in a veil, his hands were tied
behind his back, and after he had been scourged by the lictor, he was
suspended in the midst of the forum on a cross, or inauspicious tree.

2. Nocturnal meetings in the city; whatever might be the pretence, of
pleasure, or religion, or the public good.

3. The murder of a citizen; for which the common feelings of mankind
demand the blood of the murderer. Poison is still more odious than the
sword or dagger; and we are surprised to discover, in two flagitious
events, how early such subtle wickedness had infected the simplicity
of the republic, and the chaste virtues of the Roman matrons. [174] The
parricide, who violated the duties of nature and gratitude, was cast
into the river or the sea, enclosed in a sack; and a cock, a viper,
a dog, and a monkey, were successively added, as the most suitable
companions. [175] Italy produces no monkeys; but the want could never be
felt, till the middle of the sixth century first revealed the guilt of a
parricide. [176]

4. The malice of an incendiary. After the previous ceremony of whipping,
he himself was delivered to the flames; and in this example alone our
reason is tempted to applaud the justice of retaliation.

5. Judicial perjury. The corrupt or malicious witness was thrown
headlong from the Tarpeian rock, to expiate his falsehood, which was
rendered still more fatal by the severity of the penal laws, and the
deficiency of written evidence.

6. The corruption of a judge, who accepted bribes to pronounce an
iniquitous sentence.

7. Libels and satires, whose rude strains sometimes disturbed the
peace of an illiterate city. The author was beaten with clubs, a worthy
chastisement, but it is not certain that he was left to expire under the
blows of the executioner. [177]

8. The nocturnal mischief of damaging or destroying a neighbor's corn.
The criminal was suspended as a grateful victim to Ceres. But the sylvan
deities were less implacable, and the extirpation of a more valuable
tree was compensated by the moderate fine of twenty-five pounds of
copper.

9. Magical incantations; which had power, in the opinion of the Latin
shepherds, to exhaust the strength of an enemy, to extinguish his life,
and to remove from their seats his deep-rooted plantations.

The cruelty of the twelve tables against insolvent debtors still remains
to be told; and I shall dare to prefer the literal sense of antiquity
to the specious refinements of modern criticism. [178] [1781] After
the judicial proof or confession of the debt, thirty days of grace
were allowed before a Roman was delivered into the power of his
fellow-citizen. In this private prison, twelve ounces of rice were his
daily food; he might be bound with a chain of fifteen pounds weight;
and his misery was thrice exposed in the market place, to solicit the
compassion of his friends and countrymen. At the expiration of sixty
days, the debt was discharged by the loss of liberty or life; the
insolvent debtor was either put to death, or sold in foreign slavery
beyond the Tyber: but, if several creditors were alike obstinate and
unrelenting, they might legally dismember his body, and satiate their
revenge by this horrid partition. The advocates for this savage law have
insisted, that it must strongly operate in deterring idleness and
fraud from contracting debts which they were unable to discharge; but
experience would dissipate this salutary terror, by proving that no
creditor could be found to exact this unprofitable penalty of life or
limb. As the manners of Rome were insensibly polished, the criminal code
of the decemvirs was abolished by the humanity of accusers, witnesses,
and judges; and impunity became the consequence of immoderate rigor. The
Porcian and Valerian laws prohibited the magistrates from inflicting
on a free citizen any capital, or even corporal, punishment; and the
obsolete statutes of blood were artfully, and perhaps truly, ascribed to
the spirit, not of patrician, but of regal, tyranny.

[Footnote 171: The narrative of Livy (i. 28) is weighty and solemn.
At tu, Albane, maneres, is a harsh reflection, unworthy of Virgil's
humanity, (Aeneid, viii. 643.) Heyne, with his usual good taste,
observes that the subject was too horrid for the shield of Aencas, (tom.
iii. p. 229.)]

[Footnote 172: The age of Draco (Olympiad xxxix. l) is fixed by Sir John
Marsham (Canon Chronicus, p. 593--596) and Corsini, (Fasti Attici, tom.
iii. p. 62.) For his laws, see the writers on the government of Athens,
Sigonius, Meursius, Potter, &c.]

[Footnote 173: The viith, de delictis, of the xii. tables is delineated
by Gravina, (Opp. p. 292, 293, with a commentary, p. 214--230.) Aulus
Gellius (xx. 1) and the Collatio Legum Mosaicarum et Romanarum afford
much original information.]

[Footnote 174: Livy mentions two remarkable and flagitious aeras, of
3000 persons accused, and of 190 noble matrons convicted, of the crime
of poisoning, (xl. 43, viii. 18.) Mr. Hume discriminates the ages of
private and public virtue, (Essays, vol. i. p. 22, 23.) I would rather
say that such ebullitions of mischief (as in France in the year 1680)
are accidents and prodigies which leave no marks on the manners of a
nation.]

[Footnote 175: The xii. tables and Cicero (pro Roscio Amerino, c. 25,
26) are content with the sack; Seneca (Excerpt. Controvers. v 4)
adorns it with serpents; Juvenal pities the guiltless monkey (innoxia
simia--156.) Adrian (apud Dositheum Magistrum, l. iii. c. p. 874--876,
with Schulting's Note,) Modestinus, (Pandect. xlviii. tit. ix. leg. 9,)
Constantine, (Cod. l. ix. tit. xvii.,) and Justinian, (Institut. l. iv.
tit. xviii.,) enumerate all the companions of the parricide. But this
fanciful execution was simplified in practice. Hodie tamen viv exuruntur
vel ad bestias dantur, (Paul. Sentent. Recept. l. v. tit. xxiv p. 512,
edit. Schulting.)]

[Footnote 176: The first parricide at Rome was L. Ostius, after the
second Punic war, (Plutarch, in Romulo, tom. i. p. 54.) During the
Cimbric, P. Malleolus was guilty of the first matricide, (Liv. Epitom.
l. lxviii.)]

[Footnote 177: Horace talks of the formidine fustis, (l. ii. epist. ii.
154,) but Cicero (de Republica, l. iv. apud Augustin. de Civitat. Dei,
ix. 6, in Fragment. Philosoph. tom. iii. p. 393, edit. Olivet) affirms
that the decemvirs made libels a capital offence: cum perpaucas res
capite sanxisent--perpaucus!]

[Footnote 178: Bynkershoek (Observat. Juris Rom. l. i. c. 1, in Opp.
tom. i. p. 9, 10, 11) labors to prove that the creditors divided not the
body, but the price, of the insolvent debtor. Yet his interpretation is
one perpetual harsh metaphor; nor can he surmount the Roman authorities
of Quintilian, Caecilius, Favonius, and Tertullian. See Aulus Gellius,
Noct. Attic. xxi.]

[Footnote 1781: Hugo (Histoire du Droit Romain, tom. i. p. 234) concurs
with Gibbon See Niebuhr, vol. ii. p. 313.--M.]

In the absence of penal laws, and the insufficiency of civil actions,
the peace and justice of the city were imperfectly maintained by the
private jurisdiction of the citizens. The malefactors who replenish our
jails are the outcasts of society, and the crimes for which they suffer
may be commonly ascribed to ignorance, poverty, and brutal appetite. For
the perpetration of similar enormities, a vile plebeian might claim
and abuse the sacred character of a member of the republic: but, on the
proof or suspicion of guilt, the slave, or the stranger, was nailed to
a cross; and this strict and summary justice might be exercised without
restraint over the greatest part of the populace of Rome.

Each family contained a domestic tribunal, which was not confined, like
that of the praetor, to the cognizance of external actions: virtuous
principles and habits were inculcated by the discipline of education;
and the Roman father was accountable to the state for the manners of
his children, since he disposed, without appeal, of their life, their
liberty, and their inheritance. In some pressing emergencies, the
citizen was authorized to avenge his private or public wrongs. The
consent of the Jewish, the Athenian, and the Roman laws approved the
slaughter of the nocturnal thief; though in open daylight a robber could
not be slain without some previous evidence of danger and complaint.
Whoever surprised an adulterer in his nuptial bed might freely exercise
his revenge; [179] the most bloody and wanton outrage was excused by
the provocation; [180] nor was it before the reign of Augustus that
the husband was reduced to weigh the rank of the offender, or that the
parent was condemned to sacrifice his daughter with her guilty seducer.
After the expulsion of the kings, the ambitious Roman, who should dare
to assume their title or imitate their tyranny, was devoted to the
infernal gods: each of his fellow-citizens was armed with the sword
of justice; and the act of Brutus, however repugnant to gratitude or
prudence, had been already sanctified by the judgment of his country.
[181] The barbarous practice of wearing arms in the midst of peace,
[182] and the bloody maxims of honor, were unknown to the Romans; and,
during the two purest ages, from the establishment of equal freedom to
the end of the Punic wars, the city was never disturbed by sedition,
and rarely polluted with atrocious crimes. The failure of penal laws was
more sensibly felt, when every vice was inflamed by faction at home and
dominion abroad. In the time of Cicero, each private citizen enjoyed the
privilege of anarchy; each minister of the republic was exalted to
the temptations of regal power, and their virtues are entitled to the
warmest praise, as the spontaneous fruits of nature or philosophy. After
a triennial indulgence of lust, rapine, and cruelty, Verres, the tyrant
of Sicily, could only be sued for the pecuniary restitution of three
hundred thousand pounds sterling; and such was the temper of the laws,
the judges, and perhaps the accuser himself, [183] that, on refunding
a thirteenth part of his plunder, Verres could retire to an easy and
luxurious exile. [184]

[Footnote 179: The first speech of Lysias (Reiske, Orator. Graec. tom.
v. p. 2--48) is in defence of a husband who had killed the adulterer.
The rights of husbands and fathers at Rome and Athens are discussed with
much learning by Dr. Taylor, (Lectiones Lysiacae, c. xi. in Reiske, tom.
vi. p. 301--308.)]

Sicily, (Divinatio in Caecilium, c. 5,) which he afterwards reduced to
quadringenties, (320,000 L.--1 Actio in Verrem, c. 18,) and was finally
content with tricies, (24,000l L.) Plutarch (in Ciceron. tom. iii. p.
1584) has not dissembled the popular suspicion and report.]

[Footnote 184: Verres lived near thirty years after his trial, till the
second triumvirate, when he was proscribed by the taste of Mark Antony
for the sake of his Corinthian plate, (Plin. Hist. Natur. xxxiv. 3.)]

The first imperfect attempt to restore the proportion of crimes and
punishments was made by the dictator Sylla, who, in the midst of his
sanguinary triumph, aspired to restrain the license, rather than
to oppress the liberty, of the Romans. He gloried in the arbitrary
proscription of four thousand seven hundred citizens. [185] But, in the
character of a legislator, he respected the prejudices of the times;
and, instead of pronouncing a sentence of death against the robber or
assassin, the general who betrayed an army, or the magistrate who ruined
a province, Sylla was content to aggravate the pecuniary damages by
the penalty of exile, or, in more constitutional language, by the
interdiction of fire and water. The Cornelian, and afterwards
the Pompeian and Julian, laws introduced a new system of criminal
jurisprudence; [186] and the emperors, from Augustus to Justinian,
disguised their increasing rigor under the names of the original
authors. But the invention and frequent use of extraordinary pains
proceeded from the desire to extend and conceal the progress of
despotism. In the condemnation of illustrious Romans, the senate was
always prepared to confound, at the will of their masters, the judicial
and legislative powers. It was the duty of the governors to maintain the
peace of their province, by the arbitrary and rigid administration of
justice; the freedom of the city evaporated in the extent of empire,
and the Spanish malefactor, who claimed the privilege of a Roman, was
elevated by the command of Galba on a fairer and more lofty cross. [187]
Occasional rescripts issued from the throne to decide the questions
which, by their novelty or importance, appeared to surpass the authority
and discernment of a proconsul. Transportation and beheading were
reserved for honorable persons; meaner criminals were either hanged,
or burnt, or buried in the mines, or exposed to the wild beasts of the
amphitheatre. Armed robbers were pursued and extirpated as the enemies
of society; the driving away horses or cattle was made a capital
offence; [188] but simple theft was uniformly considered as a mere civil
and private injury. The degrees of guilt, and the modes of punishment,
were too often determined by the discretion of the rulers, and the
subject was left in ignorance of the legal danger which he might incur
by every action of his life.

[Footnote 185: Such is the number assigned by Valer'us Maximus, (l. ix.
c. 2, No. 1,) Florus (iv. 21) distinguishes 2000 senators and
knights. Appian (de Bell. Civil. l. i. c. 95, tom. ii. p. 133, edit.
Schweighauser) more accurately computes forty victims of the senatorian
rank, and 1600 of the equestrian census or order.]

punishment, (Paul, Sentent. Recept. l. iv. tit. xviii. p. 497, 498.)
Hadrian, (ad Concil. Baeticae,) most severe where the offence was most
frequent, condemns the criminals, ad gladium, ludi damnationem, (Ulpian,
de Officio Proconsulis, l. viii. in Collatione Legum Mosaic. et Rom.
tit. xi p. 235.)]

A sin, a vice, a crime, are the objects of theology, ethics, and
jurisprudence. Whenever their judgments agree, they corroborate each
other; but, as often as they differ, a prudent legislator appreciates
the guilt and punishment according to the measure of social injury. On
this principle, the most daring attack on the life and property of a
private citizen is judged less atrocious than the crime of treason or
rebellion, which invades the majesty of the republic: the obsequious
civilians unanimously pronounced, that the republic is contained in the
person of its chief; and the edge of the Julian law was sharpened by
the incessant diligence of the emperors. The licentious commerce of the
sexes may be tolerated as an impulse of nature, or forbidden as a source
of disorder and corruption; but the fame, the fortunes, the family of
the husband, are seriously injured by the adultery of the wife. The
wisdom of Augustus, after curbing the freedom of revenge, applied to
this domestic offence the animadversion of the laws: and the guilty
parties, after the payment of heavy forfeitures and fines, were
condemned to long or perpetual exile in two separate islands. [189]
Religion pronounces an equal censure against the infidelity of the
husband; but, as it is not accompanied by the same civil effects,
the wife was never permitted to vindicate her wrongs; [190] and the
distinction of simple or double adultery, so familiar and so important
in the canon law, is unknown to the jurisprudence of the Code and the
Pandects. I touch with reluctance, and despatch with impatience, a more
odious vice, of which modesty rejects the name, and nature abominates
the idea. The primitive Romans were infected by the example of the
Etruscans [191] and Greeks: [192] and in the mad abuse of prosperity
and power, every pleasure that is innocent was deemed insipid; and the
Scatinian law, [193] which had been extorted by an act of violence,
was insensibly abolished by the lapse of time and the multitude of
criminals. By this law, the rape, perhaps the seduction, of an ingenuous
youth, was compensated, as a personal injury, by the poor damages of ten
thousand sesterces, or fourscore pounds; the ravisher might be slain by
the resistance or revenge of chastity; and I wish to believe, that at
Rome, as in Athens, the voluntary and effeminate deserter of his sex
was degraded from the honors and the rights of a citizen. [194] But the
practice of vice was not discouraged by the severity of opinion:
the indelible stain of manhood was confounded with the more venial
transgressions of fornication and adultery, nor was the licentious lover
exposed to the same dishonor which he impressed on the male or female
partner of his guilt. From Catullus to Juvenal, [195] the poets accuse
and celebrate the degeneracy of the times; and the reformation of
manners was feebly attempted by the reason and authority of the
civilians till the most virtuous of the Caesars proscribed the sin
against nature as a crime against society. [196]

[Footnote 189: Till the publication of the Julius Paulus of Schulting,
(l. ii. tit. xxvi. p. 317--323,) it was affirmed and believed that the
Julian laws punished adultery with death; and the mistake arose from the
fraud or error of Tribonian. Yet Lipsius had suspected the truth from
the narratives of Tacitus, (Annal. ii. 50, iii. 24, iv. 42,) and
even from the practice of Augustus, who distinguished the treasonable
frailties of his female kindred.]

[Footnote 190: In cases of adultery, Severus confined to the husband the
right of public accusation, (Cod. Justinian, l. ix. tit. ix. leg. 1.)
Nor is this privilege unjust--so different are the effects of male or
female infidelity.]

[Footnote 191: Timon (l. i.) and Theopompus (l. xliii. apud Athenaeum,
l. xii. p. 517) describe the luxury and lust of the Etruscans. About the
same period (A. U. C. 445) the Roman youth studied in Etruria, (liv. ix.
36.)]

[Footnote 192: The Persians had been corrupted in the same school,
(Herodot. l. i. c. 135.) A curious dissertation might be formed on the
introduction of paederasty after the time of Homer, its progress among
the Greeks of Asia and Europe, the vehemence of their passions, and the
thin device of virtue and friendship which amused the philosophers of
Athens. But scelera ostendi oportet dum puniuntur, abscondi flagitia.]

[Footnote 193: The name, the date, and the provisions of this law are
equally doubtful, (Gravina, Opp. p. 432, 433. Heineccius, Hist. Jur.
Rom. No. 108. Ernesti, Clav. Ciceron. in Indice Legum.) But I will
observe that the nefanda Venus of the honest German is styled aversa by
the more polite Italian.]

[Footnote 194: See the oration of Aeschines against the catamite
Timarchus, (in Reiske, Orator. Graec. tom. iii. p. 21--184.)]

[Footnote 195: A crowd of disgraceful passages will force themselves
on the memory of the classic reader: I will only remind him of the cool
declaration of Ovid:-- Odi concubitus qui non utrumque resolvant. Hoc
est quod puerum tangar amore minus.]

112 Aurelius Victor, in Philippo, Codex Theodos. l. ix. tit. vii. leg.
7, and Godefroy's Commentary, tom. iii. p. 63. Theodosius abolished the
subterraneous brothels of Rome, in which the prostitution of both sexes
was acted with impunity.]
