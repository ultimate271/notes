## Chapter XLI: Conquests Of Justinian, Charact Of Balisarius.--Part V.

As soon as Belisarius was delivered from his foreign and domestic
enemies, he seriously applied his forces to the final reduction of
Italy. In the siege of Osimo, the general was nearly transpierced with
an arrow, if the mortal stroke had not been intercepted by one of his
guards, who lost, in that pious office, the use of his hand. The Goths
of Osimo, [1041] four thousand warriors, with those of Faesulae and the
Cottian Alps, were among the last who maintained their independence; and
their gallant resistance, which almost tired the patience, deserved the
esteem, of the conqueror. His prudence refused to subscribe the safe
conduct which they asked, to join their brethren of Ravenna; but they
saved, by an honorable capitulation, one moiety at least of their
wealth, with the free alternative of retiring peaceably to their
estates, or enlisting to serve the emperor in his Persian wars. The
multitudes which yet adhered to the standard of Vitiges far surpassed
the number of the Roman troops; but neither prayers nor defiance, nor
the extreme danger of his most faithful subjects, could tempt the Gothic
king beyond the fortifications of Ravenna. These fortifications were,
indeed, impregnable to the assaults of art or violence; and when
Belisarius invested the capital, he was soon convinced that famine only
could tame the stubborn spirit of the Barbarians. The sea, the land,
and the channels of the Po, were guarded by the vigilance of the Roman
general; and his morality extended the rights of war to the practice of
poisoning the waters, [105] and secretly firing the granaries [106] of
a besieged city. [107] While he pressed the blockade of Ravenna, he was
surprised by the arrival of two ambassadors from Constantinople, with
a treaty of peace, which Justinian had imprudently signed, without
deigning to consult the author of his victory. By this disgraceful and
precarious agreement, Italy and the Gothic treasure were divided,
and the provinces beyond the Po were left with the regal title to the
successor of Theodoric. The ambassadors were eager to accomplish their
salutary commission; the captive Vitiges accepted, with transport, the
unexpected offer of a crown; honor was less prevalent among the Goths,
than the want and appetite of food; and the Roman chiefs, who murmured
at the continuance of the war, professed implicit submission to the
commands of the emperor. If Belisarius had possessed only the courage
of a soldier, the laurel would have been snatched from his hand by timid
and envious counsels; but in this decisive moment, he resolved, with
the magnanimity of a statesman, to sustain alone the danger and merit of
generous disobedience. Each of his officers gave a written opinion that
the siege of Ravenna was impracticable and hopeless: the general then
rejected the treaty of partition, and declared his own resolution of
leading Vitiges in chains to the feet of Justinian. The Goths retired
with doubt and dismay: this peremptory refusal deprived them of the only
signature which they could trust, and filled their minds with a just
apprehension, that a sagacious enemy had discovered the full extent of
their deplorable state. They compared the fame and fortune of Belisarius
with the weakness of their ill-fated king; and the comparison suggested
an extraordinary project, to which Vitiges, with apparent resignation,
was compelled to acquiesce. Partition would ruin the strength, exile
would disgrace the honor, of the nation; but they offered their arms,
their treasures, and the fortifications of Ravenna, if Belisarius would
disclaim the authority of a master, accept the choice of the Goths, and
assume, as he had deserved, the kingdom of Italy. If the false lustre
of a diadem could have tempted the loyalty of a faithful subject, his
prudence must have foreseen the inconstancy of the Barbarians, and his
rational ambition would prefer the safe and honorable station of a
Roman general. Even the patience and seeming satisfaction with which he
entertained a proposal of treason, might be susceptible of a malignant
interpretation. But the lieutenant of Justinian was conscious of his own
rectitude; he entered into a dark and crooked path, as it might lead
to the voluntary submission of the Goths; and his dexterous policy
persuaded them that he was disposed to comply with their wishes, without
engaging an oath or a promise for the performance of a treaty which he
secretly abhorred. The day of the surrender of Ravenna was stipulated
by the Gothic ambassadors: a fleet, laden with provisions, sailed as
a welcome guest into the deepest recess of the harbor: the gates were
opened to the fancied king of Italy; and Belisarius, without meeting an
enemy, triumphantly marched through the streets of an impregnable city.
[108] The Romans were astonished by their success; the multitudes of
tall and robust Barbarians were confounded by the image of their own
patience and the masculine females, spitting in the faces of their sons
and husbands, most bitterly reproached them for betraying their dominion
and freedom to these pygmies of the south, contemptible in their
numbers, diminutive in their stature. Before the Goths could recover
from the first surprise, and claim the accomplishment of their doubtful
hopes, the victor established his power in Ravenna, beyond the danger of
repentance and revolt.

[Footnote 1041: Auximum, p. 175.--M.]

[Footnote 105: In the siege of Auximum, he first labored to demolish
an old aqueduct, and then cast into the stream, 1. dead bodies; 2.
mischievous herbs; and 3. quicklime. (says Procopius, l. ii. c. 27) Yet
both words are used as synonymous in Galen, Dioscorides, and Lucian,
(Hen. Steph. Thesaur. Ling. Graec. tom. iii. p. 748.)]

[Footnote 106: The Goths suspected Mathasuintha as an accomplice in the
mischief, which perhaps was occasioned by accidental lightning.]

[Footnote 107: In strict philosophy, a limitation of the rights of war
seems to imply nonsense and contradiction. Grotius himself is lost in
an idle distinction between the jus naturae and the jus gentium, between
poison and infection. He balances in one scale the passages of Homer
(Odyss. A 259, &c.) and Florus, (l. ii. c. 20, No. 7, ult.;) and in the
other, the examples of Solon (Pausanias, l. x. c. 37) and Belisarius.
See his great work De Jure Belli et Pacis, (l. iii. c. 4, s. 15, 16, 17,
and in Barbeyrac's version, tom. ii. p. 257, &c.) Yet I can understand
the benefit and validity of an agreement, tacit or express, mutually to
abstain from certain modes of hostility. See the Amphictyonic oath in
Aeschines, de falsa Legatione.]

[Footnote 108: Ravenna was taken, not in the year 540, but in the latter
end of 539; and Pagi (tom. ii. p. 569) is rectified by Muratori. (Annali
d'Italia, tom. v. p. 62,) who proves from an original act on papyrus,
(Antiquit. Italiae Medii Aevi, tom. ii. dissert. xxxii. p. 999--1007,)
Maffei, (Istoria Diplomat. p. 155-160,) that before the third of
January, 540, peace and free correspondence were restored between
Ravenna and Faenza.] Vitiges, who perhaps had attempted to escape, was
honorably guarded in his palace; [109] the flower of the Gothic youth
was selected for the service of the emperor; the remainder of the people
was dismissed to their peaceful habitations in the southern provinces;
and a colony of Italians was invited to replenish the depopulated city.
The submission of the capital was imitated in the towns and villages of
Italy, which had not been subdued, or even visited, by the Romans; and
the independent Goths, who remained in arms at Pavia and Verona, were
ambitious only to become the subjects of Belisarius. But his inflexible
loyalty rejected, except as the substitute of Justinian, their oaths of
allegiance; and he was not offended by the reproach of their deputies,
that he rather chose to be a slave than a king.

[Footnote 109: He was seized by John the Sanguinary, but an oath or
sacrament was pledged for his safety in the Basilica Julii, (Hist.
Miscell. l. xvii. in Muratori, tom. i. p. 107.) Anastasius (in Vit.
Pont. p. 40) gives a dark but probable account. Montfaucon is quoted by
Mascou (Hist. of the Germans, xii. 21) for a votive shield representing
the captivity of Vitiges and now in the collection of Signor Landi at
Rome.]

After the second victory of Belisarius, envy again whispered, Justinian
listened, and the hero was recalled. "The remnant of the Gothic war was
no longer worthy of his presence: a gracious sovereign was impatient to
reward his services, and to consult his wisdom; and he alone was
capable of defending the East against the innumerable armies of Persia."
Belisarius understood the suspicion, accepted the excuse, embarked at
Ravenna his spoils and trophies; and proved, by his ready obedience,
that such an abrupt removal from the government of Italy was not less
unjust than it might have been indiscreet. The emperor received with
honorable courtesy both Vitiges and his more noble consort; and as the
king of the Goths conformed to the Athanasian faith, he obtained, with
a rich inheritance of land in Asia, the rank of senator and patrician.
[110] Every spectator admired, without peril, the strength and stature
of the young Barbarians: they adored the majesty of the throne, and
promised to shed their blood in the service of their benefactor.
Justinian deposited in the Byzantine palace the treasures of the Gothic
monarchy. A flattering senate was sometime admitted to gaze on the
magnificent spectacle; but it was enviously secluded from the public
view: and the conqueror of Italy renounced, without a murmur, perhaps
without a sigh, the well-earned honors of a second triumph. His glory
was indeed exalted above all external pomp; and the faint and hollow
praises of the court were supplied, even in a servile age, by the
respect and admiration of his country. Whenever he appeared in the
streets and public places of Constantinople, Belisarius attracted
and satisfied the eyes of the people. His lofty stature and majestic
countenance fulfilled their expectations of a hero; the meanest of his
fellow-citizens were emboldened by his gentle and gracious demeanor;
and the martial train which attended his footsteps left his person more
accessible than in a day of battle. Seven thousand horsemen, matchless
for beauty and valor, were maintained in the service, and at the private
expense, of the general. [111] Their prowess was always conspicuous in
single combats, or in the foremost ranks; and both parties confessed
that in the siege of Rome, the guards of Belisarius had alone vanquished
the Barbarian host. Their numbers were continually augmented by the
bravest and most faithful of the enemy; and his fortunate captives,
the Vandals, the Moors, and the Goths, emulated the attachment of his
domestic followers. By the union of liberality and justice, he acquired
the love of the soldiers, without alienating the affections of the
people. The sick and wounded were relieved with medicines and money;
and still more efficaciously, by the healing visits and smiles of their
commander. The loss of a weapon or a horse was instantly repaired, and
each deed of valor was rewarded by the rich and honorable gifts of a
bracelet or a collar, which were rendered more precious by the judgment
of Belisarius. He was endeared to the husbandmen by the peace and plenty
which they enjoyed under the shadow of his standard. Instead of being
injured, the country was enriched by the march of the Roman armies;
and such was the rigid discipline of their camp, that not an apple was
gathered from the tree, not a path could be traced in the fields of
corn. Belisarius was chaste and sober. In the license of a military
life, none could boast that they had seen him intoxicated with wine:
the most beautiful captives of Gothic or Vandal race were offered to
his embraces; but he turned aside from their charms, and the husband of
Antonina was never suspected of violating the laws of conjugal fidelity.
The spectator and historian of his exploits has observed, that amidst
the perils of war, he was daring without rashness, prudent without fear,
slow or rapid according to the exigencies of the moment; that in the
deepest distress he was animated by real or apparent hope, but that he
was modest and humble in the most prosperous fortune. By these virtues,
he equalled or excelled the ancient masters of the military art.
Victory, by sea and land, attended his arms. He subdued Africa, Italy,
and the adjacent islands; led away captives the successors of Genseric
and Theodoric; filled Constantinople with the spoils of their palaces;
and in the space of six years recovered half the provinces of the
Western empire. In his fame and merit, in wealth and power, he remained
without a rival, the first of the Roman subjects; the voice of envy
could only magnify his dangerous importance; and the emperor might
applaud his own discerning spirit, which had discovered and raised
the genius of Belisarius. [Footnote 110: Vitiges lived two years at
Constantinople, and imperatoris in affectu convictus (or conjunctus)
rebus excessit humanis. His widow Mathasuenta, the wife and mother of
the patricians, the elder and younger Germanus, united the streams of
Anician and Amali blood, (Jornandes, c. 60, p. 221, in Muratori, tom.
i.)]

[Footnote 111: Procopius, Goth. l. iii. c. 1. Aimoin, a French monk of
the xith century, who had obtained, and has disfigured, some authentic
information of Belisarius, mentions, in his name, 12,000, pueri or
slaves--quos propriis alimus stipendiis--besides 18,000 soldiers,
(Historians of France, tom. iii. De Gestis Franc. l. ii. c. 6, p. 48.)]

It was the custom of the Roman triumphs, that a slave should be placed
behind the chariot to remind the conqueror of the instability of
fortune, and the infirmities of human nature. Procopius, in his
Anecdotes, has assumed that servile and ungrateful office. The generous
reader may cast away the libel, but the evidence of facts will adhere to
his memory; and he will reluctantly confess, that the fame, and even
the virtue, of Belisarius, were polluted by the lust and cruelty of his
wife; and that hero deserved an appellation which may not drop from
the pen of the decent historian. The mother of Antonina [112] was a
theatrical prostitute, and both her father and grandfather exercised, at
Thessalonica and Constantinople, the vile, though lucrative, profession
of charioteers. In the various situations of their fortune she became
the companion, the enemy, the servant, and the favorite of the empress
Theodora: these loose and ambitious females had been connected by
similar pleasures; they were separated by the jealousy of vice, and at
length reconciled by the partnership of guilt. Before her marriage with
Belisarius, Antonina had one husband and many lovers: Photius, the son
of her former nuptials, was of an age to distinguish himself at the
siege of Naples; and it was not till the autumn of her age and beauty
[113] that she indulged a scandalous attachment to a Thracian youth.
Theodosius had been educated in the Eunomian heresy; the African voyage
was consecrated by the baptism and auspicious name of the first soldier
who embarked; and the proselyte was adopted into the family of his
spiritual parents, [114] Belisarius and Antonina. Before they touched
the shores of Africa, this holy kindred degenerated into sensual love:
and as Antonina soon overleaped the bounds of modesty and caution,
the Roman general was alone ignorant of his own dishonor. During their
residence at Carthage, he surprised the two lovers in a subterraneous
chamber, solitary, warm, and almost naked. Anger flashed from his eyes.
"With the help of this young man," said the unblushing Antonina, "I was
secreting our most precious effects from the knowledge of Justinian."
The youth resumed his garments, and the pious husband consented to
disbelieve the evidence of his own senses. From this pleasing and
perhaps voluntary delusion, Belisarius was awakened at Syracuse, by the
officious information of Macedonia; and that female attendant, after
requiring an oath for her security, produced two chamberlains, who, like
herself, had often beheld the adulteries of Antonina. A hasty flight
into Asia saved Theodosius from the justice of an injured husband, who
had signified to one of his guards the order of his death; but the tears
of Antonina, and her artful seductions, assured the credulous hero
of her innocence: and he stooped, against his faith and judgment, to
abandon those imprudent friends, who had presumed to accuse or doubt the
chastity of his wife. The revenge of a guilty woman is implacable and
bloody: the unfortunate Macedonia, with the two witnesses, were secretly
arrested by the minister of her cruelty; their tongues were cut out,
their bodies were hacked into small pieces, and their remains were cast
into the Sea of Syracuse. A rash though judicious saying of Constantine,
"I would sooner have punished the adulteress than the boy," was deeply
remembered by Antonina; and two years afterwards, when despair had armed
that officer against his general, her sanguinary advice decided and
hastened his execution. Even the indignation of Photius was not forgiven
by his mother; the exile of her son prepared the recall of her lover;
and Theodosius condescended to accept the pressing and humble invitation
of the conqueror of Italy. In the absolute direction of his household,
and in the important commissions of peace and war, [115] the favorite
youth most rapidly acquired a fortune of four hundred thousand pounds
sterling; and after their return to Constantinople, the passion of
Antonina, at least, continued ardent and unabated. But fear, devotion,
and lassitude perhaps, inspired Theodosius with more serious thoughts.
He dreaded the busy scandal of the capital, and the indiscreet fondness
of the wife of Belisarius; escaped from her embraces, and retiring to
Ephesus, shaved his head, and took refuge in the sanctuary of a monastic
life. The despair of the new Ariadne could scarcely have been excused
by the death of her husband. She wept, she tore her hair, she filled the
palace with her cries; "she had lost the dearest of friends, a tender, a
faithful, a laborious friend!" But her warm entreaties, fortified by the
prayers of Belisarius, were insufficient to draw the holy monk from the
solitude of Ephesus. It was not till the general moved forward for
the Persian war, that Theodosius could be tempted to return to
Constantinople; and the short interval before the departure of Antonina
herself was boldly devoted to love and pleasure. [Footnote 112: The
diligence of Alemannus could add but little to the four first and most
curious chapters of the Anecdotes. Of these strange Anecdotes, a part
may be true, because probable--and a part true, because improbable.
Procopius must have known the former, and the latter he could scarcely
invent. Note: The malice of court scandal is proverbially inventive; and
of such scandal the "Anecdota" may be an embellished record.--M.]

[Footnote 113: Procopius intimates (Anecdot. c. 4) that when Belisarius
returned to Italy, (A.D. 543,) Antonina was sixty years of age. A
forced, but more polite construction, which refers that date to the
moment when he was writing, (A.D. 559,) would be compatible with the
manhood of Photius, (Gothic. l. i. c. 10) in 536.]

[Footnote 114: Gompare the Vandalic War (l. i. c. 12) with the Anecdotes
(c. i.) and Alemannus, (p. 2, 3.) This mode of baptismal adoption was
revived by Leo the philosopher.]

[Footnote 115: In November, 537, Photius arrested the pope, (Liberat.
Brev. c. 22. Pagi, tom. ii. p. 562) About the end of 539, Belisarius
sent Theodosius on an important and lucrative commission to Ravenna,
(Goth. l. ii. c. 18.)]

A philosopher may pity and forgive the infirmities of female nature,
from which he receives no real injury: but contemptible is the husband
who feels, and yet endures, his own infamy in that of his wife. Antonina
pursued her son with implacable hatred; and the gallant Photius [116]
was exposed to her secret persecutions in the camp beyond the Tigris.
Enraged by his own wrongs, and by the dishonor of his blood, he cast
away in his turn the sentiments of nature, and revealed to Belisarius
the turpitude of a woman who had violated all the duties of a mother
and a wife. From the surprise and indignation of the Roman general, his
former credulity appears to have been sincere: he embraced the knees of
the son of Antonina, adjured him to remember his obligations rather than
his birth, and confirmed at the altar their holy vows of revenge and
mutual defence. The dominion of Antonina was impaired by absence; and
when she met her husband, on his return from the Persian confines,
Belisarius, in his first and transient emotions, confined her person,
and threatened her life. Photius was more resolved to punish, and less
prompt to pardon: he flew to Ephesus; extorted from a trusty eunuch of
his another the full confession of her guilt; arrested Theodosius and
his treasures in the church of St. John the Apostle, and concealed his
captives, whose execution was only delayed, in a secure and sequestered
fortress of Cilicia. Such a daring outrage against public justice could
not pass with impunity; and the cause of Antonina was espoused by the
empress, whose favor she had deserved by the recent services of the
disgrace of a praefect, and the exile and murder of a pope. At the end
of the campaign, Belisarius was recalled; he complied, as usual, with
the Imperial mandate. His mind was not prepared for rebellion: his
obedience, however adverse to the dictates of honor, was consonant to
the wishes of his heart; and when he embraced his wife, at the command,
and perhaps in the presence, of the empress, the tender husband was
disposed to forgive or to be forgiven. The bounty of Theodora reserved
for her companion a more precious favor. "I have found," she said, "my
dearest patrician, a pearl of inestimable value; it has not yet been
viewed by any mortal eye; but the sight and the possession of this
jewel are destined for my friend." [1161] As soon as the curiosity
and impatience of Antonina were kindled, the door of a bed-chamber was
thrown open, and she beheld her lover, whom the diligence of the eunuchs
had discovered in his secret prison. Her silent wonder burst into
passionate exclamations of gratitude and joy, and she named Theodora
her queen, her benefactress, and her savior. The monk of Ephesus
was nourished in the palace with luxury and ambition; but instead
of assuming, as he was promised, the command of the Roman armies,
Theodosius expired in the first fatigues of an amorous interview. [1162]
The grief of Antonina could only be assuaged by the sufferings of her
son. A youth of consular rank, and a sickly constitution, was punished,
without a trial, like a malefactor and a slave: yet such was the
constancy of his mind, that Photius sustained the tortures of the
scourge and the rack, [1163] without violating the faith which he had
sworn to Belisarius. After this fruitless cruelty, the son of
Antonina, while his mother feasted with the empress, was buried in her
subterraneous prisons, which admitted not the distinction of night
and day. He twice escaped to the most venerable sanctuaries of
Constantinople, the churches of St. Sophia, and of the Virgin: but his
tyrants were insensible of religion as of pity; and the helpless youth,
amidst the clamors of the clergy and people, was twice dragged from the
altar to the dungeon. His third attempt was more successful. At the end
of three years, the prophet Zachariah, or some mortal friend, indicated
the means of an escape: he eluded the spies and guards of the empress,
reached the holy sepulchre of Jerusalem, embraced the profession of a
monk; and the abbot Photius was employed, after the death of Justinian,
to reconcile and regulate the churches of Egypt. The son of Antonina
suffered all that an enemy can inflict: her patient husband imposed on
himself the more exquisite misery of violating his promise and deserting
his friend.

[Footnote 116: Theophanes (Chronograph. p. 204) styles him Photinus, the
son-in-law of Belisarius; and he is copied by the Historia Miscella and
Anastasius.]

[Footnote 1161: This and much of the private scandal in the
"Anecdota" is liable to serious doubt. Who reported all these private
conversations, and how did they reach the ears of Procopius?--M.]

[Footnote 1162: This is a strange misrepresentation--he died of a
dysentery; nor does it appear that it was immediately after this scene.
Antonina proposed to raise him to the generalship of the army. Procop.
Anecd. p. 14. The sudden change from the abstemious diet of a monk to
the luxury of the court is a much more probable cause of his death.--M.]

[Footnote 1163: The expression of Procopius does not appear to me to
mean this kind of torture. Ibid.--M.]

In the succeeding campaign, Belisarius was again sent against the
Persians: he saved the East, but he offended Theodora, and perhaps the
emperor himself. The malady of Justinian had countenanced the rumor of
his death; and the Roman general, on the supposition of that probable
event spoke the free language of a citizen and a soldier. His colleague
Buzes, who concurred in the same sentiments, lost his rank, his liberty,
and his health, by the persecution of the empress: but the disgrace of
Belisarius was alleviated by the dignity of his own character, and the
influence of his wife, who might wish to humble, but could not desire to
ruin, the partner of her fortunes. Even his removal was colored by the
assurance, that the sinking state of Italy would be retrieved by the
single presence of its conqueror.

But no sooner had he returned, alone and defenceless, than a hostile
commission was sent to the East, to seize his treasures and criminate
his actions; the guards and veterans, who followed his private banner,
were distributed among the chiefs of the army, and even the eunuchs
presumed to cast lots for the partition of his martial domestics.
When he passed with a small and sordid retinue through the streets
of Constantinople, his forlorn appearance excited the amazement and
compassion of the people. Justinian and Theodora received him with cold
ingratitude; the servile crowd, with insolence and contempt; and in
the evening he retired with trembling steps to his deserted palace. An
indisposition, feigned or real, had confined Antonina to her apartment;
and she walked disdainfully silent in the adjacent portico, while
Belisarius threw himself on his bed, and expected, in an agony of grief
and terror, the death which he had so often braved under the walls of
Rome. Long after sunset a messenger was announced from the empress: he
opened, with anxious curiosity, the letter which contained the sentence
of his fate. "You cannot be ignorant how much you have deserved my
displeasure. I am not insensible of the services of Antonina. To her
merits and intercession I have granted your life, and permit you to
retain a part of your treasures, which might be justly forfeited to the
state. Let your gratitude, where it is due, be displayed, not in words,
but in your future behavior." I know not how to believe or to relate the
transports with which the hero is said to have received this ignominious
pardon. He fell prostrate before his wife, he kissed the feet of his
savior, and he devoutly promised to live the grateful and submissive
slave of Antonina. A fine of one hundred and twenty thousand pounds
sterling was levied on the fortunes of Belisarius; and with the office
of count, or master of the royal stables, he accepted the conduct of the
Italian war. At his departure from Constantinople, his friends, and even
the public, were persuaded that as soon as he regained his freedom,
he would renounce his dissimulation, and that his wife, Theodora, and
perhaps the emperor himself, would be sacrificed to the just revenge
of a virtuous rebel. Their hopes were deceived; and the unconquerable
patience and loyalty of Belisarius appear either below or above the
character of a man. [117]

[Footnote 117: The continuator of the Chronicle of Marcellinus gives,
in a few decent words, the substance of the Anecdotes: Belisarius de
Oriente evocatus, in offensam periculumque incurrens grave, et invidiae
subeacens rursus remittitur in Italiam, (p. 54.)]
