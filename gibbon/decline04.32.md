## Chapter XLV: State Of Italy Under The Lombards.--Part III.

So rapid was the influence of climate and example, that the Lombards of
the fourth generation surveyed with curiosity and affright the portraits
of their savage forefathers. [49] Their heads were shaven behind,
but the shaggy locks hung over their eyes and mouth, and a long beard
represented the name and character of the nation. Their dress consisted
of loose linen garments, after the fashion of the Anglo-Saxons, which
were decorated, in their opinion, with broad stripes or variegated
colors. The legs and feet were clothed in long hose, and open sandals;
and even in the security of peace a trusty sword was constantly girt to
their side. Yet this strange apparel, and horrid aspect, often concealed
a gentle and generous disposition; and as soon as the rage of battle
had subsided, the captives and subjects were sometimes surprised by the
humanity of the victor. The vices of the Lombards were the effect of
passion, of ignorance, of intoxication; their virtues are the more
laudable, as they were not affected by the hypocrisy of social manners,
nor imposed by the rigid constraint of laws and education. I should not
be apprehensive of deviating from my subject, if it were in my power
to delineate the private life of the conquerors of Italy; and I shall
relate with pleasure the adventurous gallantry of Autharis, which
breathes the true spirit of chivalry and romance. [50] After the loss
of his promised bride, a Merovingian princess, he sought in marriage the
daughter of the king of Bavaria; and Garribald accepted the alliance of
the Italian monarch. Impatient of the slow progress of negotiation, the
ardent lover escaped from his palace, and visited the court of Bavaria
in the train of his own embassy. At the public audience, the unknown
stranger advanced to the throne, and informed Garribald that the
ambassador was indeed the minister of state, but that he alone was the
friend of Autharis, who had trusted him with the delicate commission of
making a faithful report of the charms of his spouse. Theudelinda was
summoned to undergo this important examination; and, after a pause
of silent rapture, he hailed her as the queen of Italy, and humbly
requested that, according to the custom of the nation, she would present
a cup of wine to the first of her new subjects. By the command of
her father she obeyed: Autharis received the cup in his turn, and, in
restoring it to the princess, he secretly touched her hand, and drew his
own finger over his face and lips. In the evening, Theudelinda imparted
to her nurse the indiscreet familiarity of the stranger, and was
comforted by the assurance, that such boldness could proceed only from
the king her husband, who, by his beauty and courage, appeared worthy of
her love. The ambassadors were dismissed: no sooner did they reach the
confines of Italy than Autharis, raising himself on his horse, darted
his battle-axe against a tree with incomparable strength and dexterity.
"Such," said he to the astonished Bavarians, "such are the strokes of
the king of the Lombards." On the approach of a French army, Garribald
and his daughter took refuge in the dominions of their ally; and the
marriage was consummated in the palace of Verona. At the end of one
year, it was dissolved by the death of Autharis: but the virtues of
Theudelinda [51] had endeared her to the nation, and she was permitted
to bestow, with her hand, the sceptre of the Italian kingdom.

[Footnote 49: The epitaph of Droctulf (Paul, l. iii. c. 19) may be
applied to many of his countrymen:-- Terribilis visu facies, sed corda
benignus Longaque robusto pectore barba fuit. The portraits of the old
Lombards might still be seen in the palace of Monza, twelve miles from
Milan, which had been founded or restored by Queen Theudelinda, (l. iv.
22, 23.) See Muratori, tom. i. disserta, xxiii. p. 300.]

[Footnote 50: The story of Autharis and Theudelinda is related by Paul,
l. iii. 29, 34; and any fragment of Bavarian antiquity excites the
indefatigable diligence of the count de Buat, Hist. des Peuples de
l'Europe, ton. xi. p. 595--635, tom. xii. p. 1-53.]

[Footnote 51: Giannone (Istoria Civile de Napoli, tom. i. p. 263) has
justly censured the impertinence of Boccaccio, (Gio. iii. Novel. 2,)
who, without right, or truth, or pretence, has given the pious queen
Theudelinda to the arms of a muleteer.]

From this fact, as well as from similar events, [52] it is certain that
the Lombards possessed freedom to elect their sovereign, and sense to
decline the frequent use of that dangerous privilege. The public revenue
arose from the produce of land and the profits of justice. When the
independent dukes agreed that Autharis should ascend the throne of
his father, they endowed the regal office with a fair moiety of their
respective domains. The proudest nobles aspired to the honors of
servitude near the person of their prince: he rewarded the fidelity of
his vassals by the precarious gift of pensions and benefices; and
atoned for the injuries of war by the rich foundation of monasteries and
churches. In peace a judge, a leader in war, he never usurped the
powers of a sole and absolute legislator. The king of Italy convened the
national assemblies in the palace, or more probably in the fields, of
Pavia: his great council was composed of the persons most eminent by
their birth and dignities; but the validity, as well as the execution,
of their decrees depended on the approbation of the faithful people, the
fortunate army of the Lombards. About fourscore years after the conquest
of Italy, their traditional customs were transcribed in Teutonic Latin,
[53] and ratified by the consent of the prince and people: some new
regulations were introduced, more suitable to their present condition;
the example of Rotharis was imitated by the wisest of his successors;
and the laws of the Lombards have been esteemed the least imperfect of
the Barbaric codes. [54] Secure by their courage in the possession of
liberty, these rude and hasty legislators were incapable of balancing
the powers of the constitution, or of discussing the nice theory
of political government. Such crimes as threatened the life of the
sovereign, or the safety of the state, were adjudged worthy of death;
but their attention was principally confined to the defence of
the person and property of the subject. According to the strange
jurisprudence of the times, the guilt of blood might be redeemed by a
fine; yet the high price of nine hundred pieces of gold declares a
just sense of the value of a simple citizen. Less atrocious injuries,
a wound, a fracture, a blow, an opprobrious word, were measured with
scrupulous and almost ridiculous diligence; and the prudence of the
legislator encouraged the ignoble practice of bartering honor and
revenge for a pecuniary compensation. The ignorance of the Lombards in
the state of Paganism or Christianity gave implicit credit to the malice
and mischief of witchcraft, but the judges of the seventeenth century
might have been instructed and confounded by the wisdom of Rotharis, who
derides the absurd superstition, and protects the wretched victims
of popular or judicial cruelty. [55] The same spirit of a legislator,
superior to his age and country, may be ascribed to Luitprand, who
condemns, while he tolerates, the impious and inveterate abuse of duels,
[56] observing, from his own experience, that the juster cause had often
been oppressed by successful violence. Whatever merit may be discovered
in the laws of the Lombards, they are the genuine fruit of the reason
of the Barbarians, who never admitted the bishops of Italy to a seat in
their legislative councils. But the succession of their kings is marked
with virtue and ability; the troubled series of their annals is adorned
with fair intervals of peace, order, and domestic happiness; and the
Italians enjoyed a milder and more equitable government, than any of
the other kingdoms which had been founded on the ruins of the Western
empire. [57]

and the first volume of Giannone's history, may be consulted for the

critical notes of Muratori.]

name of a witch. It is of the purest classic origin, (Horat. epod. v.
20. Petron. c. 134;) and from the words of Petronius, (quae striges
comederunt nervos tuos?) it may be inferred that the prejudice was of
Italian rather than Barbaric extraction.]

c. 16. Baronius rejects the praise, which appears to contradict the
invectives of Pope Gregory the Great; but Muratori (Annali d' Italia,
tom. v. p. 217) presumes to insinuate that the saint may have magnified
the faults of Arians and enemies.]

Amidst the arms of the Lombards, and under the despotism of the Greeks,
we again inquire into the fate of Rome, [58] which had reached, about
the close of the sixth century, the lowest period of her depression.
By the removal of the seat of empire, and the successive loss of the
provinces, the sources of public and private opulence were exhausted:
the lofty tree, under whose shade the nations of the earth had reposed,
was deprived of its leaves and branches, and the sapless trunk was left
to wither on the ground. The ministers of command, and the messengers of
victory, no longer met on the Appian or Flaminian way; and the hostile
approach of the Lombards was often felt, and continually feared. The
inhabitants of a potent and peaceful capital, who visit without an
anxious thought the garden of the adjacent country, will faintly picture
in their fancy the distress of the Romans: they shut or opened their
gates with a trembling hand, beheld from the walls the flames of their
houses, and heard the lamentations of their brethren, who were coupled
together like dogs, and dragged away into distant slavery beyond the sea
and the mountains. Such incessant alarms must annihilate the pleasures
and interrupt the labors of a rural life; and the Campagna of Rome was
speedily reduced to the state of a dreary wilderness, in which the land
is barren, the waters are impure, and the air is infectious. Curiosity
and ambition no longer attracted the nations to the capital of the
world: but, if chance or necessity directed the steps of a wandering
stranger, he contemplated with horror the vacancy and solitude of the
city, and might be tempted to ask, Where is the senate, and where are
the people? In a season of excessive rains, the Tyber swelled above its
banks, and rushed with irresistible violence into the valleys of the
seven hills. A pestilential disease arose from the stagnation of the
deluge, and so rapid was the contagion, that fourscore persons expired
in an hour in the midst of a solemn procession, which implored the mercy
of Heaven. [59] A society in which marriage is encouraged and industry
prevails soon repairs the accidental losses of pestilence and war:
but, as the far greater part of the Romans was condemned to hopeless
indigence and celibacy, the depopulation was constant and visible, and
the gloomy enthusiasts might expect the approaching failure of the human
race. [60] Yet the number of citizens still exceeded the measure of
subsistence: their precarious food was supplied from the harvests of
Sicily or Egypt; and the frequent repetition of famine betrays the
inattention of the emperor to a distant province. The edifices of Rome
were exposed to the same ruin and decay: the mouldering fabrics were
easily overthrown by inundations, tempests, and earthquakes: and the
monks, who had occupied the most advantageous stations, exulted in their
base triumph over the ruins of antiquity. [61] It is commonly believed,
that Pope Gregory the First attacked the temples and mutilated the
statues of the city; that, by the command of the Barbarian, the Palatine
library was reduced to ashes, and that the history of Livy was the
peculiar mark of his absurd and mischievous fanaticism. The writings
of Gregory himself reveal his implacable aversion to the monuments of
classic genius; and he points his severest censure against the profane
learning of a bishop, who taught the art of grammar, studied the Latin
poets, and pronounced with the same voice the praises of Jupiter and
those of Christ. But the evidence of his destructive rage is doubtful
and recent: the Temple of Peace, or the theatre of Marcellus, have been
demolished by the slow operation of ages, and a formal proscription
would have multiplied the copies of Virgil and Livy in the countries
which were not subject to the ecclesiastical dictator. [62]

[Footnote 58: The passages of the homilies of Gregory, which represent
the miserable state of the city and country, are transcribed in the
Annals of Baronius, A.D. 590, No. 16, A.D. 595, No. 2, &c., &c.]

[Footnote 59: The inundation and plague were reported by a deacon, whom
his bishop, Gregory of Tours, had despatched to Rome for some relics
The ingenious messenger embellished his tale and the river with a great
dragon and a train of little serpents, (Greg. Turon. l. x. c. 1.)]

[Footnote 60: Gregory of Rome (Dialog. l. ii. c. 15) relates a memorable
prediction of St. Benedict. Roma a Gentilibus non exterminabitur sed
tempestatibus, coruscis turbinibus ac terrae motu in semetipsa marces
cet. Such a prophecy melts into true history, and becomes the evidence
of the fact after which it was invented.]

[Footnote 61: Quia in uno se ore cum Jovis laudibus, Christi laudes non
capiunt, et quam grave nefandumque sit episcopis canere quod nec laico
religioso conveniat, ipse considera, (l. ix. ep. 4.) The writings of
Gregory himself attest his innocence of any classic taste or literature]

[Footnote 62: Bayle, (Dictionnaire Critique, tom. ii. 598, 569,) in
a very good article of Gregoire I., has quoted, for the buildings and
statues, Platina in Gregorio I.; for the Palatine library, John of
Salisbury, (de Nugis Curialium, l. ii. c. 26;) and for Livy, Antoninus
of Florence: the oldest of the three lived in the xiith century.]

Like Thebes, or Babylon, or Carthage, the names of Rome might have been
erased from the earth, if the city had not been animated by a vital
principle, which again restored her to honor and dominion. A vague
tradition was embraced, that two Jewish teachers, a tent-maker and a
fisherman, had formerly been executed in the circus of Nero, and at
the end of five hundred years, their genuine or fictitious relics were
adored as the Palladium of Christian Rome. The pilgrims of the East and
West resorted to the holy threshold; but the shrines of the apostles
were guarded by miracles and invisible terrors; and it was not without
fear that the pious Catholic approached the object of his worship.
It was fatal to touch, it was dangerous to behold, the bodies of the
saints; and those who, from the purest motives, presumed to disturb the
repose of the sanctuary, were affrighted by visions, or punished with
sudden death. The unreasonable request of an empress, who wished to
deprive the Romans of their sacred treasure, the head of St. Paul,
was rejected with the deepest abhorrence; and the pope asserted, most
probably with truth, that a linen which had been sanctified in the
neighborhood of his body, or the filings of his chain, which it was
sometimes easy and sometimes impossible to obtain, possessed an equal
degree of miraculous virtue. [63] But the power as well as virtue of the
apostles resided with living energy in the breast of their successors;
and the chair of St. Peter was filled under the reign of Maurice by the
first and greatest of the name of Gregory. [64] His grandfather Felix
had himself been pope, and as the bishops were already bound by the laws
of celibacy, his consecration must have been preceded by the death of
his wife. The parents of Gregory, Sylvia, and Gordian, were the noblest
of the senate, and the most pious of the church of Rome; his female
relations were numbered among the saints and virgins; and his own
figure, with those of his father and mother, were represented near
three hundred years in a family portrait, [65] which he offered to the
monastery of St. Andrew. The design and coloring of this picture afford
an honorable testimony that the art of painting was cultivated by
the Italians of the sixth century; but the most abject ideas must be
entertained of their taste and learning, since the epistles of Gregory,
his sermons, and his dialogues, are the work of a man who was second in
erudition to none of his contemporaries: [66] his birth and abilities
had raised him to the office of praefect of the city, and he enjoyed
the merit of renouncing the pomps and vanities of this world. His ample
patrimony was dedicated to the foundation of seven monasteries, [67] one
in Rome, [68] and six in Sicily; and it was the wish of Gregory that he
might be unknown in this life, and glorious only in the next. Yet his
devotion (and it might be sincere) pursued the path which would have
been chosen by a crafty and ambitious statesman. The talents of Gregory,
and the splendor which accompanied his retreat, rendered him dear and
useful to the church; and implicit obedience has always been inculcated
as the first duty of a monk. As soon as he had received the character of
deacon, Gregory was sent to reside at the Byzantine court, the nuncio or
minister of the apostolic see; and he boldly assumed, in the name of St.
Peter, a tone of independent dignity, which would have been criminal and
dangerous in the most illustrious layman of the empire. He returned to
Rome with a just increase of reputation, and, after a short exercise
of the monastic virtues, he was dragged from the cloister to the papal
throne, by the unanimous voice of the clergy, the senate, and the
people. He alone resisted, or seemed to resist, his own elevation; and
his humble petition, that Maurice would be pleased to reject the choice
of the Romans, could only serve to exalt his character in the eyes
of the emperor and the public. When the fatal mandate was proclaimed,
Gregory solicited the aid of some friendly merchants to convey him in
a basket beyond the gates of Rome, and modestly concealed himself some
days among the woods and mountains, till his retreat was discovered, as
it is said, by a celestial light. [Footnote 63: Gregor. l. iii. epist.
24, edict. 12, &c. From the epistles of Gregory, and the viiith volume
of the Annals of Baronius, the pious reader may collect the particles
of holy iron which were inserted in keys or crosses of gold, and
distributed in Britain, Gaul, Spain, Africa, Constantinople, and Egypt.
The pontifical smith who handled the file must have understood the
miracles which it was in his own power to operate or withhold; a
circumstance which abates the superstition of Gregory at the expense of
his veracity.]

[Footnote 64: Besides the epistles of Gregory himself, which are
methodized by Dupin, (Bibliotheque Eccles. tom. v. p. 103--126,) we have
three lives of the pope; the two first written in the viiith and ixth
centuries, (de Triplici Vita St. Greg. Preface to the ivth volume of
the Benedictine edition,) by the deacons Paul (p. 1--18) and John, (p.
19--188,) and containing much original, though doubtful, evidence; the
third, a long and labored compilation by the Benedictine editors, (p.
199--305.) The annals of Baronius are a copious but partial history.
His papal prejudices are tempered by the good sense of Fleury, (Hist.
Eccles. tom. viii.,) and his chronology has been rectified by the
criticism of Pagi and Muratori.]

[Footnote 65: John the deacon has described them like an eye-witness,
(l. iv. c. 83, 84;) and his description is illustrated by Angelo Rocca,
a Roman antiquary, (St. Greg. Opera, tom. iv. p. 312--326;) who observes
that some mosaics of the popes of the viith century are still preserved
in the old churches of Rome, (p. 321--323) The same walls which
represented Gregory's family are now decorated with the martyrdom of St.
Andrew, the noble contest of Dominichino and Guido.]

rhetorica, dialectica ita apuero est institutus, ut quamvis eo tempore

[Footnote 67: The Benedictines (Vit. Greg. l. i. p. 205--208) labor to
reduce the monasteries of Gregory within the rule of their own order;
but, as the question is confessed to be doubtful, it is clear that these
powerful monks are in the wrong. See Butler's Lives of the Saints,
vol. iii. p. 145; a work of merit: the sense and learning belong to the
author--his prejudices are those of his profession.]

which fronts the Palatine; they are now occupied by the Camaldoli: San

The pontificate of Gregory the Great, which lasted thirteen years, six
months, and ten days, is one of the most edifying periods of the history
of the church. His virtues, and even his faults, a singular mixture
of simplicity and cunning, of pride and humility, of sense and
superstition, were happily suited to his station and to the temper of
the times. In his rival, the patriarch of Constantinople, he condemned
the anti-Christian title of universal bishop, which the successor of
St. Peter was too haughty to concede, and too feeble to assume; and
the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Gregory was confined to the triple
character of Bishop of Rome, Primate of Italy, and Apostle of the West.
He frequently ascended the pulpit, and kindled, by his rude, though
pathetic, eloquence, the congenial passions of his audience: the
language of the Jewish prophets was interpreted and applied; and the
minds of a people, depressed by their present calamities, were directed
to the hopes and fears of the invisible world. His precepts and example
defined the model of the Roman liturgy; [69] the distribution of the
parishes, the calendar of the festivals, the order of processions, the
service of the priests and deacons, the variety and change of sacerdotal
garments. Till the last days of his life, he officiated in the canon of
the mass, which continued above three hours: the Gregorian chant [70]
has preserved the vocal and instrumental music of the theatre, and the
rough voices of the Barbarians attempted to imitate the melody of the
Roman school. [71] Experience had shown him the efficacy of these solemn
and pompous rites, to soothe the distress, to confirm the faith, to
mitigate the fierceness, and to dispel the dark enthusiasm of the
vulgar, and he readily forgave their tendency to promote the reign
of priesthood and superstition. The bishops of Italy and the adjacent
islands acknowledged the Roman pontiff as their special metropolitan.
Even the existence, the union, or the translation of episcopal seats was
decided by his absolute discretion: and his successful inroads into the
provinces of Greece, of Spain, and of Gaul, might countenance the more
lofty pretensions of succeeding popes. He interposed to prevent the
abuses of popular elections; his jealous care maintained the purity of
faith and discipline; and the apostolic shepherd assiduously watched
over the faith and discipline of the subordinate pastors. Under his
reign, the Arians of Italy and Spain were reconciled to the Catholic
church, and the conquest of Britain reflects less glory on the name of
Caesar, than on that of Gregory the First. Instead of six legions, forty
monks were embarked for that distant island, and the pontiff lamented
the austere duties which forbade him to partake the perils of their
spiritual warfare. In less than two years, he could announce to the
archbishop of Alexandria, that they had baptized the king of Kent with
ten thousand of his Anglo-Saxons, and that the Roman missionaries,
like those of the primitive church, were armed only with spiritual and
supernatural powers. The credulity or the prudence of Gregory was always
disposed to confirm the truths of religion by the evidence of ghosts,
miracles, and resurrections; [72] and posterity has paid to his memory
the same tribute which he freely granted to the virtue of his own or the
preceding generation. The celestial honors have been liberally bestowed
by the authority of the popes, but Gregory is the last of their own
order whom they have presumed to inscribe in the calendar of saints.

[Footnote 69: The Lord's Prayer consists of half a dozen lines; the
Sacramentarius and Antiphonarius of Gregory fill 880 folio pages, (tom.
iii. p. i. p. 1--880;) yet these only constitute a part of the Ordo
Romanus, which Mabillon has illustrated and Fleury has abridged, (Hist.
Eccles. tom. viii. p. 139--152.)]

[Footnote 70: I learn from the Abbe Dobos, (Reflexions sur la Poesie
et la Peinture, tom. iii. p. 174, 175,) that the simplicity of the
Ambrosian chant was confined to four modes, while the more perfect
harmony of the Gregorian comprised the eight modes or fifteen chords of
the ancient music. He observes (p. 332) that the connoisseurs admire the
preface and many passages of the Gregorian office.]

[Footnote 71: John the deacon (in Vit. Greg. l. ii. c. 7) expresses the
early contempt of the Italians for tramontane singing. Alpina scilicet
corpora vocum suarum tonitruis altisone perstrepentia, susceptae
modulationis dulcedinem proprie non resultant: quia bibuli gutturis
barbara feritas dum inflexionibus et repercussionibus mitem nititur
edere cantilenam, naturali quodam fragore, quasi plaustra per gradus
confuse sonantia, rigidas voces jactat, &c. In the time of Charlemagne,
the Franks, though with some reluctance, admitted the justice of the
reproach. Muratori, Dissert. xxv.]

[Footnote 72: A French critic (Petrus Gussanvillus, Opera, tom. ii. p.
105--112) has vindicated the right of Gregory to the entire nonsense of
the Dialogues. Dupin (tom. v. p. 138) does not think that any one will
vouch for the truth of all these miracles: I should like to know how
many of them he believed himself.]

Their temporal power insensibly arose from the calamities of the times:
and the Roman bishops, who have deluged Europe and Asia with blood, were
compelled to reign as the ministers of charity and peace. I. The church
of Rome, as it has been formerly observed, was endowed with ample
possessions in Italy, Sicily, and the more distant provinces; and her
agents, who were commonly sub-deacons, had acquired a civil, and even
criminal, jurisdiction over their tenants and husbandmen. The successor
of St. Peter administered his patrimony with the temper of a vigilant
and moderate landlord; [73] and the epistles of Gregory are filled with
salutary instructions to abstain from doubtful or vexatious lawsuits;
to preserve the integrity of weights and measures; to grant every
reasonable delay; and to reduce the capitation of the slaves of
the glebe, who purchased the right of marriage by the payment of an
arbitrary fine. [74] The rent or the produce of these estates was
transported to the mouth of the Tyber, at the risk and expense of the
pope: in the use of wealth he acted like a faithful steward of
the church and the poor, and liberally applied to their wants the
inexhaustible resources of abstinence and order. The voluminous account
of his receipts and disbursements was kept above three hundred years
in the Lateran, as the model of Christian economy. On the four great
festivals, he divided their quarterly allowance to the clergy, to his
domestics, to the monasteries, the churches, the places of burial, the
almshouses, and the hospitals of Rome, and the rest of the diocese. On
the first day of every month, he distributed to the poor, according to
the season, their stated portion of corn, wine, cheese, vegetables,
oil, fish, fresh provisions, clothes, and money; and his treasurers were
continually summoned to satisfy, in his name, the extraordinary demands
of indigence and merit. The instant distress of the sick and helpless,
of strangers and pilgrims, was relieved by the bounty of each day, and
of every hour; nor would the pontiff indulge himself in a frugal repast,
till he had sent the dishes from his own table to some objects deserving
of his compassion. The misery of the times had reduced the nobles and
matrons of Rome to accept, without a blush, the benevolence of the
church: three thousand virgins received their food and raiment from the
hand of their benefactor; and many bishops of Italy escaped from the
Barbarians to the hospitable threshold of the Vatican. Gregory might
justly be styled the Father of his Country; and such was the extreme
sensibility of his conscience, that, for the death of a beggar who had
perished in the streets, he interdicted himself during several days
from the exercise of sacerdotal functions. II. The misfortunes of Rome
involved the apostolical pastor in the business of peace and war; and it
might be doubtful to himself, whether piety or ambition prompted him to
supply the place of his absent sovereign. Gregory awakened the emperor
from a long slumber; exposed the guilt or incapacity of the exarch and
his inferior ministers; complained that the veterans were withdrawn from
Rome for the defence of Spoleto; encouraged the Italians to guard their
cities and altars; and condescended, in the crisis of danger, to name
the tribunes, and to direct the operations, of the provincial troops.
But the martial spirit of the pope was checked by the scruples of
humanity and religion: the imposition of tribute, though it was employed
in the Italian war, he freely condemned as odious and oppressive; whilst
he protected, against the Imperial edicts, the pious cowardice of the
soldiers who deserted a military for a monastic life If we may credit
his own declarations, it would have been easy for Gregory to exterminate
the Lombards by their domestic factions, without leaving a king, a duke,
or a count, to save that unfortunate nation from the vengeance of their
foes As a Christian bishop, he preferred the salutary offices of peace;
his mediation appeased the tumult of arms: but he was too conscious of
the arts of the Greeks, and the passions of the Lombards, to engage his
sacred promise for the observance of the truce. Disappointed in the hope
of a general and lasting treaty, he presumed to save his country without
the consent of the emperor or the exarch. The sword of the enemy was
suspended over Rome; it was averted by the mild eloquence and seasonable
gifts of the pontiff, who commanded the respect of heretics and
Barbarians. The merits of Gregory were treated by the Byzantine court
with reproach and insult; but in the attachment of a grateful people, he
found the purest reward of a citizen, and the best right of a sovereign.
[75]

[Footnote 73: Baronius is unwilling to expatiate on the care of the
patrimonies, lest he should betray that they consisted not of kingdoms,
but farms. The French writers, the Benedictine editors, (tom. iv. l.
