## Chapter XV: Progress Of The Christian Religion.--Part III.

In consequence of this opinion, it was the first but arduous duty of
a Christian to preserve himself pure and undefiled by the practice
of idolatry. The religion of the nations was not merely a speculative
doctrine professed in the schools or preached in the temples. The
innumerable deities and rites of polytheism were closely interwoven
with every circumstance of business or pleasure, of public or of
private life; and it seemed impossible to escape the observance of them,
without, at the same time, renouncing the commerce of mankind, and all
the offices and amusements of society. [40] The important transactions of
peace and war were prepared or concluded by solemn sacrifices, in which
the magistrate, the senator, and the soldier, were obliged to preside or
to participate. [41] The public spectacles were an essential part of the
cheerful devotion of the Pagans, and the gods were supposed to accept,
as the most grateful offering, the games that the prince and people
celebrated in honor of their peculiar festivals. [42] The Christians, who
with pious horror avoided the abomination of the circus or the theatre,
found himself encompassed with infernal snares in every convivial
entertainment, as often as his friends, invoking the hospitable deities,
poured out libations to each other's happiness. [43] When the bride,
struggling with well-affected reluctance, was forced into hymenaeal pomp
over the threshold of her new habitation, [44] or when the sad procession
of the dead slowly moved towards the funeral pile; [45] the Christian,
on these interesting occasions, was compelled to desert the persons
who were the dearest to him, rather than contract the guilt inherent
to those impious ceremonies. Every art and every trade that was in the
least concerned in the framing or adorning of idols was polluted by the
stain of idolatry; [46] a severe sentence, since it devoted to eternal
misery the far greater part of the community, which is employed in the
exercise of liberal or mechanic professions. If we cast our eyes over
the numerous remains of antiquity, we shall perceive, that besides the
immediate representations of the gods, and the holy instruments of their
worship, the elegant forms and agreeable fictions consecrated by the
imagination of the Greeks, were introduced as the richest ornaments of
the houses, the dress, and the furniture of the Pagan. [47] Even the arts
of music and painting, of eloquence and poetry, flowed from the same
impure origin. In the style of the fathers, Apollo and the Muses were
the organs of the infernal spirit; Homer and Virgil were the most
eminent of his servants; and the beautiful mythology which pervades and
animates the compositions of their genius, is destined to celebrate
the glory of the daemons. Even the common language of Greece and Rome
abounded with familiar but impious expressions, which the imprudent
Christian might too carelessly utter, or too patiently hear. [48]

[Footnote 40: Tertullian has written a most severe treatise against
idolatry, to caution his brethren against the hourly danger of incurring
that guilt. Recogita sylvam, et quantae latitant spinae. De Corona
Militis, c. 10.]

[Footnote 41: The Roman senate was always held in a temple or
consecrated place. (Aulus Gellius, xiv. 7.) Before they entered on
business, every senator dropped some wine and frankincense on the altar.
Sueton. in August. c. 35.]

[Footnote 42: See Tertullian, De Spectaculis. This severe reformer
shows no more indulgence to a tragedy of Euripides, than to a combat of
gladiators. The dress of the actors particularly offends him. By the
use of the lofty buskin, they impiously strive to add a cubit to their
stature. c. 23.]

[Footnote 43: The ancient practice of concluding the entertainment with
libations, may be found in every classic. Socrates and Seneca, in their
last moments, made a noble application of this custom. Postquam stagnum,
calidae aquae introiit, respergens proximos servorum, addita voce,
libare se liquorem illum Jovi Liberatori. Tacit. Annal. xv. 64.]

[Footnote 44: See the elegant but idolatrous hymn of Catullus, on the
nuptials of Manlius and Julia. O Hymen, Hymenaee Io! Quis huic Deo
compararier ausit?]

[Footnote 45: The ancient funerals (in those of Misenus and Pallas) are
no less accurately described by Virgil, than they are illustrated by his
commentator Servius. The pile itself was an altar, the flames were fed
with the blood of victims, and all the assistants were sprinkled with
lustral water.]

[Footnote 46: Tertullian de Idololatria, c. 11. * Note: The exaggerated
and declamatory opinions of Tertullian ought not to be taken as the
general sentiment of the early Christians. Gibbon has too often allowed
himself to consider the peculiar notions of certain Fathers of the
Church as inherent in Christianity. This is not accurate.--G.]

[Footnote 47: See every part of Montfaucon's Antiquities. Even the
reverses of the Greek and Roman coins were frequently of an idolatrous
nature. Here indeed the scruples of the Christian were suspended by a
stronger passion. Note: All this scrupulous nicety is at variance with
the decision of St. Paul about meat offered to idols, 1, Cor. x. 21--
32.--M.]

[Footnote 48: Tertullian de Idololatria, c. 20, 21, 22. If a Pagan
friend (on the occasion perhaps of sneezing) used the familiar
expression of "Jupiter bless you," the Christian was obliged to protest
against the divinity of Jupiter.]

The dangerous temptations which on every side lurked in ambush to
surprise the unguarded believer, assailed him with redoubled violence on
the days of solemn festivals. So artfully were they framed and disposed
throughout the year, that superstition always wore the appearance of
pleasure, and often of virtue. Some of the most sacred festivals in the
Roman ritual were destined to salute the new calends of January with
vows of public and private felicity; to indulge the pious remembrance of
the dead and living; to ascertain the inviolable bounds of property;
to hail, on the return of spring, the genial powers of fecundity; to
perpetuate the two memorable areas of Rome, the foundation of the city
and that of the republic, and to restore, during the humane license
of the Saturnalia, the primitive equality of mankind. Some idea may
be conceived of the abhorrence of the Christians for such impious
ceremonies, by the scrupulous delicacy which they displayed on a much
less alarming occasion. On days of general festivity, it was the custom
of the ancients to adorn their doors with lamps and with branches
of laurel, and to crown their heads with a garland of flowers. This
innocent and elegant practice might perhaps have been tolerated as a
mere civil institution. But it most unluckily happened that the doors
were under the protection of the household gods, that the laurel was
sacred to the lover of Daphne, and that garlands of flowers, though
frequently worn as a symbol of joy or mourning, had been dedicated
in their first origin to the service of superstition. The trembling
Christians, who were persuaded in this instance to comply with the
fashion of their country, and the commands of the magistrate, labored
under the most gloomy apprehensions, from the reproaches of his own
conscience, the censures of the church, and the denunciations of divine
vengeance. [50]

[Footnote 49: Consult the most labored work of Ovid, his imperfect
Fasti. He finished no more than the first six months of the year. The
compilation of Macrobius is called the Saturnalia, but it is only a
small part of the first book that bears any relation to the title.]

[Footnote 50: Tertullian has composed a defence, or rather panegyric, of
the rash action of a Christian soldier, who, by throwing away his crown
of laurel, had exposed himself and his brethren to the most imminent
danger. By the mention of the emperors, (Severus and Caracalla,) it is
evident, notwithstanding the wishes of M. de Tillemont, that Tertullian
composed his treatise De Corona long before he was engaged in the errors
of the Montanists. See Memoires Ecclesiastiques, tom. iii. p. 384. Note:
The soldier did not tear off his crown to throw it down with contempt;
he did not even throw it away; he held it in his hand, while others were
it on their heads. Solus libero capite, ornamento in manu otioso.--G
Note: Tertullian does not expressly name the two emperors, Severus and
Caracalla: he speaks only of two emperors, and of a long peace which
the church had enjoyed. It is generally agreed that Tertullian became
a Montanist about the year 200: his work, de Corona Militis, appears
to have been written, at the earliest about the year 202 before
the persecution of Severus: it may be maintained, then, that it is
subsequent to the Montanism of the author. See Mosheim, Diss. de Apol.
Tertull. p. 53. Biblioth. Amsterd. tom. x. part ii. p. 292. Cave's Hist.
Lit. p. 92, 93.--G. ----The state of Tertullian's opinions at the
particular period is almost an idle question. "The fiery African" is not
at any time to be considered a fair representative of Christianity.--M.]

Such was the anxious diligence which was required to guard the chastity
of the gospel from the infectious breath of idolatry. The superstitious
observances of public or private rites were carelessly practised, from
education and habit, by the followers of the established religion. But
as often as they occurred, they afforded the Christians an opportunity
of declaring and confirming their zealous opposition. By these frequent
protestations their attachment to the faith was continually fortified;
and in proportion to the increase of zeal, they combated with the more
ardor and success in the holy war, which they had undertaken against the
empire of the demons.

II. The writings of Cicero [51] represent in the most lively colors the
ignorance, the errors, and the uncertainty of the ancient philosophers
with regard to the immortality of the soul. When they are desirous of
arming their disciples against the fear of death, they inculcate, as
an obvious, though melancholy position, that the fatal stroke of our
dissolution releases us from the calamities of life; and that those can
no longer suffer, who no longer exist. Yet there were a few sages of
Greece and Rome who had conceived a more exalted, and, in some respects,
a juster idea of human nature, though it must be confessed, that in
the sublime inquiry, their reason had been often guided by their
imagination, and that their imagination had been prompted by their
vanity. When they viewed with complacency the extent of their own mental
powers, when they exercised the various faculties of memory, of
fancy, and of judgment, in the most profound speculations, or the most
important labors, and when they reflected on the desire of fame, which
transported them into future ages, far beyond the bounds of death and of
the grave, they were unwilling to confound themselves with the beasts
of the field, or to suppose that a being, for whose dignity they
entertained the most sincere admiration, could be limited to a spot of
earth, and to a few years of duration. With this favorable prepossession
they summoned to their aid the science, or rather the language, of
Metaphysics. They soon discovered, that as none of the properties of
matter will apply to the operations of the mind, the human soul must
consequently be a substance distinct from the body, pure, simple, and
spiritual, incapable of dissolution, and susceptible of a much higher
degree of virtue and happiness after the release from its corporeal
prison. From these specious and noble principles, the philosophers who
trod in the footsteps of Plato deduced a very unjustifiable conclusion,
since they asserted, not only the future immortality, but the past
eternity, of the human soul, which they were too apt to consider as a
portion of the infinite and self-existing spirit, which pervades and
sustains the universe. [52] A doctrine thus removed beyond the senses
and the experience of mankind, might serve to amuse the leisure of a
philosophic mind; or, in the silence of solitude, it might sometimes
impart a ray of comfort to desponding virtue; but the faint impression
which had been received in the schools, was soon obliterated by the
commerce and business of active life. We are sufficiently acquainted
with the eminent persons who flourished in the age of Cicero, and of the
first Caesars, with their actions, their characters, and their motives,
to be assured that their conduct in this life was never regulated by any
serious conviction of the rewards or punishments of a future state.
At the bar and in the senate of Rome the ablest orators were not
apprehensive of giving offence to their hearers, by exposing that
doctrine as an idle and extravagant opinion, which was rejected with
contempt by every man of a liberal education and understanding. [53]

[Footnote 51: In particular, the first book of the Tusculan Questions,
and the treatise De Senectute, and the Somnium Scipionis, contain, in
the most beautiful language, every thing that Grecian philosophy, on
Roman good sense, could possibly suggest on this dark but important
object.]

[Footnote 52: The preexistence of human souls, so far at least
as that doctrine is compatible with religion, was adopted by many of the
Greek and Latin fathers. See Beausobre, Hist. du Manicheisme, l. vi. c.
4.]

[Footnote 53: See Cicero pro Cluent. c. 61. Caesar ap. Sallust. de
Bell. Catilis n 50. Juvenal. Satir. ii. 149. ----Esse aliquid manes, et
subterranea regna, ----------Nec pueri credunt, nisi qui nondum aeree
lavantae.]

Since therefore the most sublime efforts of philosophy can extend no
further than feebly to point out the desire, the hope, or, at most,
the probability, of a future state, there is nothing, except a
divine revelation, that can ascertain the existence, and describe the
condition, of the invisible country which is destined to receive the
souls of men after their separation from the body. But we may perceive
several defects inherent to the popular religions of Greece and Rome,
which rendered them very unequal to so arduous a task. 1. The general
system of their mythology was unsupported by any solid proofs; and the
wisest among the Pagans had already disclaimed its usurped authority. 2.
The description of the infernal regions had been abandoned to the fancy
of painters and of poets, who peopled them with so many phantoms and
monsters, who dispensed their rewards and punishments with so little
equity, that a solemn truth, the most congenial to the human heart, was
opposed and disgraced by the absurd mixture of the wildest fictions.
[54] 3. The doctrine of a future state was scarcely considered among the
devout polytheists of Greece and Rome as a fundamental article of faith.
The providence of the gods, as it related to public communities rather
than to private individuals, was principally displayed on the visible
theatre of the present world. The petitions which were offered on the
altars of Jupiter or Apollo, expressed the anxiety of their worshippers
for temporal happiness, and their ignorance or indifference concerning
a future life. [55] The important truth of the of the immortality of the
soul was inculcated with more diligence, as well as success, in India,
in Assyria, in Egypt, and in Gaul; and since we cannot attribute such
a difference to the superior knowledge of the barbarians, we we must
ascribe it to the influence of an established priesthood, which employed
the motives of virtue as the instrument of ambition. [56]

[Footnote 54: The xith book of the Odyssey gives a very dreary and
incoherent account of the infernal shades. Pindar and Virgil have
embellished the picture; but even those poets, though more correct
than their great model, are guilty of very strange inconsistencies. See
Bayle, Responses aux Questions d'un Provincial, part iii. c. 22.]

[Footnote 55: See xvith epistle of the first book of Horace, the
xiiith Satire of Juvenal, and the iid Satire of Persius: these popular
discourses express the sentiment and language of the multitude.]

[Footnote 56: If we confine ourselves to the Gauls, we may observe,
that they intrusted, not only their lives, but even their money, to
the security of another world. Vetus ille mos Gallorum occurrit (says
Valerius Maximus, l. ii. c. 6, p. 10) quos, memoria proditum est
pecunias montuas, quae his apud inferos redderentur, dare solitos.
The same custom is more darkly insinuated by Mela, l. iii. c. 2. It is
almost needless to add, that the profits of trade hold a just proportion
to the credit of the merchant, and that the Druids derived from their
holy profession a character of responsibility, which could scarcely be
claimed by any other order of men.]

We might naturally expect that a principle so essential to religion,
would have been revealed in the clearest terms to the chosen people of
Palestine, and that it might safely have been intrusted to the
hereditary priesthood of Aaron. It is incumbent on us to adore the
mysterious dispensations of Providence, [57] when we discover that the
doctrine of the immortality of the soul is omitted in the law of Moses
it is darkly insinuated by the prophets; and during the long period
which clasped between the Egyptian and the Babylonian servitudes, the
hopes as well as fears of the Jews appear to have been confined within
the narrow compass of the present life. [58] After Cyrus had permitted
the exiled nation to return into the promised land, and after Ezra had
restored the ancient records of their religion, two celebrated sects,
the Sadducees and the Pharisees, insensibly arose at Jerusalem. [59] The
former, selected from the more opulent and distinguished ranks of
society, were strictly attached to the literal sense of the Mosaic law,
and they piously rejected the immortality of the soul, as an opinion
that received no countenance from the divine book, which they revered as
the only rule of their faith. To the authority of Scripture the
Pharisees added that of tradition, and they accepted, under the name of
traditions, several speculative tenets from the philosophy or religion
of the eastern nations. The doctrines of fate or predestination, of
angels and spirits, and of a future state of rewards and punishments,
were in the number of these new articles of belief; and as the
Pharisees, by the austerity of their manners, had drawn into their party
the body of the Jewish people, the immortality of the soul became the
prevailing sentiment of the synagogue, under the reign of the Asmonaean
princes and pontiffs. The temper of the Jews was incapable of contenting
itself with such a cold and languid assent as might satisfy the mind of
a Polytheist; and as soon as they admitted the idea of a future state,
they embraced it with the zeal which has always formed the
characteristic of the nation. Their zeal, however, added nothing to its
evidence, or even probability: and it was still necessary that the
doctrine of life and immortality, which had been dictated by nature,
approved by reason, and received by superstition, should obtain the
sanction of divine truth from the authority and example of Christ.

[Footnote 57: The right reverend author of the Divine Legation of Moses
as signs a very curious reason for the omission, and most ingeniously
retorts it on the unbelievers. * Note: The hypothesis of Warburton
concerning this remarkable fact, which, as far as the Law of Moses, is
unquestionable, made few disciples; and it is difficult to suppose that
it could be intended by the author himself for more than a display of
intellectual strength. Modern writers have accounted in various ways for
the silence of the Hebrew legislator on the immortality of the soul.
According to Michaelis, "Moses wrote as an historian and as a lawgiver;
he regulated the ecclesiastical discipline, rather than the religious
belief of his people; and the sanctions of the law being temporal, he
had no occasion, and as a civil legislator could not with propriety,
threaten punishments in another world." See Michaelis, Laws of Moses,
art. 272, vol. iv. p. 209, Eng. Trans.; and Syntagma Commentationum, p.
80, quoted by Guizot. M. Guizot adds, the "ingenious conjecture of a
philosophic theologian," which approximates to an opinion long
entertained by the Editor. That writer believes, that in the state of
civilization at the time of the legislator, this doctrine, become
popular among the Jews, would necessarily have given birth to a
multitude of idolatrous superstitions which he wished to prevent. His
primary object was to establish a firm theocracy, to make his people the
conservators of the doctrine of the Divine Unity, the basis upon which
Christianity was hereafter to rest. He carefully excluded everything
which could obscure or weaken that doctrine. Other nations had strangely
abused their notions on the immortality of the soul; Moses wished to
prevent this abuse: hence he forbade the Jews from consulting
necromancers, (those who evoke the spirits of the dead.) Deut. xviii.
11. Those who reflect on the state of the Pagans and the Jews, and on
the facility with which idolatry crept in on every side, will not be
astonished that Moses has not developed a doctrine of which the
influence might be more pernicious than useful to his people. Orat.
Fest. de Vitae Immort. Spe., &c., auct. Ph. Alb. Stapfer, p. 12 13, 20.
Berne, 1787. ----Moses, as well from the intimations scattered in his
writings, the passage relating to the translation of Enoch, (Gen. v.
24,) the prohibition of necromancy, (Michaelis believes him to be the
author of the Book of Job though this opinion is in general rejected;
other learned writers consider this Book to be coeval with and known to
Moses,) as from his long residence in Egypt, and his acquaintance with
Egyptian wisdom, could not be ignorant of the doctrine of the
immortality of the soul. But this doctrine if popularly known among the
Jews, must have been purely Egyptian, and as so, intimately connected
with the whole religious system of that country. It was no doubt moulded
up with the tenet of the transmigration of the soul, perhaps with
notions analogous to the emanation system of India in which the human
soul was an efflux from or indeed a part of, the Deity. The Mosaic
religion drew a wide and impassable interval between the Creator and
created human beings: in this it differed from the Egyptian and all the
Eastern religions. As then the immortality of the soul was thus
inseparably blended with those foreign religions which were altogether
to be effaced from the minds of the people, and by no means necessary
for the establishment of the theocracy, Moses maintained silence on this
point and a purer notion of it was left to be developed at a more
favorable period in the history of man.--M.]

[Footnote 58: See Le Clerc (Prolegomena ad Hist. Ecclesiast. sect. 1, c.
8) His authority seems to carry the greater weight, as he has written a
learned and judicious commentary on the books of the Old Testament.]

According to the most natural interpretation of his words, the Sadducees
admitted only the Pentateuch; but it has pleased some modern critics
to add the Prophets to their creed, and to suppose that they contented
themselves with rejecting the traditions of the Pharisees. Dr. Jortin
has argued that point in his Remarks on Ecclesiastical History, vol. ii.
p. 103.]

When the promise of eternal happiness was proposed to mankind
on condition of adopting the faith, and of observing the precepts, of
the gospel, it is no wonder that so advantageous an offer should have
been accepted by great numbers of every religion, of every rank, and of
every province in the Roman empire. The ancient Christians were animated
by a contempt for their present existence, and by a just confidence of
immortality, of which the doubtful and imperfect faith of modern
ages cannot give us any adequate notion. In the primitive church, the
influence of truth was very powerfully strengthened by an opinion,
which, however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity,
has not been found agreeable to experience. It was universally believed,
that the end of the world, and the kingdom of heaven, were at hand.
[591] The near approach of this wonderful event had been predicted by the
apostles; the tradition of it was preserved by their earliest disciples,
and those who understood in their literal senses the discourse of Christ
himself, were obliged to expect the second and glorious coming of
the Son of Man in the clouds, before that generation was totally
extinguished, which had beheld his humble condition upon earth, and
which might still be witness of the calamities of the Jews under
Vespasian or Hadrian. The revolution of seventeen centuries has
instructed us not to press too closely the mysterious language of
prophecy and revelation; but as long as, for wise purposes, this error
was permitted to subsist in the church, it was productive of the most
salutary effects on the faith and practice of Christians, who lived in
the awful expectation of that moment, when the globe itself, and all
the various race of mankind, should tremble at the appearance of their
divine Judge. [60]

[Footnote 591: This was, in fact, an integral part of the Jewish notion
of the Messiah, from which the minds of the apostles themselves were but
gradually detached. See Bertholdt, Christologia Judaeorum, concluding
chapters--M.]

[Footnote 60: This expectation was countenanced by the twenty-fourth
chapter of St. Matthew, and by the first epistle of St. Paul to the
Thessalonians. Erasmus removes the difficulty by the help of allegory
and metaphor; and the learned Grotius ventures to insinuate, that, for
wise purposes, the pious deception was permitted to take place. * Note:
Some modern theologians explain it without discovering either allegory
or deception. They say, that Jesus Christ, after having proclaimed the
ruin of Jerusalem and of the Temple, speaks of his second coming and the
sings which were to precede it; but those who believed that the moment
was near deceived themselves as to the sense of two words, an error
which still subsists in our versions of the Gospel according to St.
Matthew, xxiv. 29, 34. In verse 29, we read, "Immediately after the
tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened," &c. The Greek word
signifies all at once, suddenly, not immediately; so that it signifies
only the sudden appearance of the signs which Jesus Christ announces not
the shortness of the interval which was to separate them from the "days
of tribulation," of which he was speaking. The verse 34 is this "Verily
I say unto you, This generation shall not pass till all these things
shall be fulfilled." Jesus, speaking to his disciples, uses these words,
which the translators have rendered by this generation, but which means
the race, the filiation of my disciples; that is, he speaks of a class
of men, not of a generation. The true sense then, according to these
learned men, is, In truth I tell you that this race of men, of which you
are the commencement, shall not pass away till this shall take place;
that is to say, the succession of Christians shall not cease till his
coming. See Commentary of M. Paulus on the New Test., edit. 1802, tom.
iii. p. 445,--446.--G. ----Others, as Rosenmuller and Kuinoel, in loc.,
confine this passage to a highly figurative description of the ruins of
the Jewish city and polity.--M.]
