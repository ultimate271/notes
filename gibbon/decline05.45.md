## Chapter LVIII: The First Crusade.--Part II.

Of the chiefs and soldiers who marched to the holy sepulchre, I will
dare to affirm, that all were prompted by the spirit of enthusiasm; the
belief of merit, the hope of reward, and the assurance of divine aid.
But I am equally persuaded, that in many it was not the sole, that in
some it was not the leading, principle of action. The use and abuse of
religion are feeble to stem, they are strong and irresistible to
impel, the stream of national manners. Against the private wars of the
Barbarians, their bloody tournaments, licentious love, and judicial
duels, the popes and synods might ineffectually thunder. It is a more
easy task to provoke the metaphysical disputes of the Greeks, to drive
into the cloister the victims of anarchy or despotism, to sanctify the
patience of slaves and cowards, or to assume the merit of the humanity
and benevolence of modern Christians. War and exercise were the reigning
passions of the Franks or Latins; they were enjoined, as a penance, to
gratify those passions, to visit distant lands, and to draw their swords
against the nation of the East. Their victory, or even their attempt,
would immortalize the names of the intrepid heroes of the cross; and the
purest piety could not be insensible to the most splendid prospect of
military glory. In the petty quarrels of Europe, they shed the blood of
their friends and countrymen, for the acquisition perhaps of a castle
or a village. They could march with alacrity against the distant and
hostile nations who were devoted to their arms; their fancy already
grasped the golden sceptres of Asia; and the conquest of Apulia and
Sicily by the Normans might exalt to royalty the hopes of the most
private adventurer. Christendom, in her rudest state, must have yielded
to the climate and cultivation of the Mahometan countries; and their
natural and artificial wealth had been magnified by the tales of
pilgrims, and the gifts of an imperfect commerce. The vulgar, both the
great and small, were taught to believe every wonder, of lands flowing
with milk and honey, of mines and treasures, of gold and diamonds, of
palaces of marble and jasper, and of odoriferous groves of cinnamon and
frankincense. In this earthly paradise, each warrior depended on
his sword to carve a plenteous and honorable establishment, which
he measured only by the extent of his wishes. [30] Their vassals and
soldiers trusted their fortunes to God and their master: the spoils of
a Turkish emir might enrich the meanest follower of the camp; and
the flavor of the wines, the beauty of the Grecian women, [31] were
temptations more adapted to the nature, than to the profession, of the
champions of the cross. The love of freedom was a powerful incitement to
the multitudes who were oppressed by feudal or ecclesiastical tyranny.
Under this holy sign, the peasants and burghers, who were attached
to the servitude of the glebe, might escape from a haughty lord, and
transplant themselves and their families to a land of liberty. The monk
might release himself from the discipline of his convent: the debtor
might suspend the accumulation of usury, and the pursuit of his
creditors; and outlaws and malefactors of every cast might continue to
brave the laws and elude the punishment of their crimes. [32]

[Footnote 30: The same hopes were displayed in the letters of the
adventurers ad animandos qui in Francia residerant. Hugh de Reiteste
could boast, that his share amounted to one abbey and ten castles, of
the yearly value of 1500 marks, and that he should acquire a hundred
castles by the conquest of Aleppo, (Guibert, p. 554, 555.)]

[Footnote 31: In his genuine or fictitious letter to the count of
Flanders, Alexius mingles with the danger of the church, and the relics
of saints, the auri et argenti amor, and pulcherrimarum foeminarum
voluptas, (p. 476;) as if, says the indignant Guibert, the Greek women
were handsomer than those of France.]

[Footnote 32: See the privileges of the Crucesignati, freedom from debt,
usury injury, secular justice, &c. The pope was their perpetual guardian
(Ducange, tom. ii. p. 651, 652.)]

These motives were potent and numerous: when we have singly computed
their weight on the mind of each individual, we must add the infinite
series, the multiplying powers, of example and fashion. The first
proselytes became the warmest and most effectual missionaries of the
cross: among their friends and countrymen they preached the duty, the
merit, and the recompense, of their holy vow; and the most reluctant
hearers were insensibly drawn within the whirlpool of persuasion and
authority. The martial youths were fired by the reproach or suspicion
of cowardice; the opportunity of visiting with an army the sepulchre of
Christ was embraced by the old and infirm, by women and children, who
consulted rather their zeal than their strength; and those who in the
evening had derided the folly of their companions, were the most eager,
the ensuing day, to tread in their footsteps. The ignorance, which
magnified the hopes, diminished the perils, of the enterprise. Since the
Turkish conquest, the paths of pilgrimage were obliterated; the chiefs
themselves had an imperfect notion of the length of the way and the
state of their enemies; and such was the stupidity of the people, that,
at the sight of the first city or castle beyond the limits of their
knowledge, they were ready to ask whether that was not the Jerusalem,
the term and object of their labors. Yet the more prudent of the
crusaders, who were not sure that they should be fed from heaven with
a shower of quails or manna, provided themselves with those precious
metals, which, in every country, are the representatives of every
commodity. To defray, according to their rank, the expenses of the
road, princes alienated their provinces, nobles their lands and castles,
peasants their cattle and the instruments of husbandry. The value of
property was depreciated by the eager competition of multitudes; while
the price of arms and horses was raised to an exorbitant height by the
wants and impatience of the buyers. [33] Those who remained at home,
with sense and money, were enriched by the epidemical disease: the
sovereigns acquired at a cheap rate the domains of their vassals; and
the ecclesiastical purchasers completed the payment by the assurance of
their prayers. The cross, which was commonly sewed on the garment, in
cloth or silk, was inscribed by some zealots on their skin: a hot iron,
or indelible liquor, was applied to perpetuate the mark; and a crafty
monk, who showed the miraculous impression on his breast was repaid with
the popular veneration and the richest benefices of Palestine. [34]

[Footnote 33: Guibert (p. 481) paints in lively colors this general
emotion. He was one of the few contemporaries who had genius enough to
feel the astonishing scenes that were passing before their eyes. Erat
itaque videre miraculum, caro omnes emere, atque vili vendere, &c.]

[Footnote 34: Some instances of these stigmata are given in the Esprit
des Croisades, (tom. iii. p. 169 &c.,) from authors whom I have not
seen]

The fifteenth of August had been fixed in the council of Clermont
for the departure of the pilgrims; but the day was anticipated by the
thoughtless and needy crowd of plebeians, and I shall briefly despatch
the calamities which they inflicted and suffered, before I enter on
the more serious and successful enterprise of the chiefs. Early in the
spring, from the confines of France and Lorraine, above sixty thousand
of the populace of both sexes flocked round the first missionary of the
crusade, and pressed him with clamorous importunity to lead them to the
holy sepulchre. The hermit, assuming the character, without the talents
or authority, of a general, impelled or obeyed the forward impulse of
his votaries along the banks of the Rhine and Danube. Their wants and
numbers soon compelled them to separate, and his lieutenant, Walter
the Penniless, a valiant though needy soldier, conducted a van guard of
pilgrims, whose condition may be determined from the proportion of eight
horsemen to fifteen thousand foot. The example and footsteps of Peter
were closely pursued by another fanatic, the monk Godescal, whose
sermons had swept away fifteen or twenty thousand peasants from the
villages of Germany. Their rear was again pressed by a herd of two
hundred thousand, the most stupid and savage refuse of the people, who
mingled with their devotion a brutal license of rapine, prostitution,
and drunkenness. Some counts and gentlemen, at the head of three
thousand horse, attended the motions of the multitude to partake in
the spoil; but their genuine leaders (may we credit such folly?) were
a goose and a goat, who were carried in the front, and to whom these
worthy Christians ascribed an infusion of the divine spirit. [35]
Of these, and of other bands of enthusiasts, the first and most easy
warfare was against the Jews, the murderers of the Son of God. In
the trading cities of the Moselle and the Rhine, their colonies were
numerous and rich; and they enjoyed, under the protection of the emperor
and the bishops, the free exercise of their religion. [36] At Verdun,
Treves, Mentz, Spires, Worms, many thousands of that unhappy people
were pillaged and massacred: [37] nor had they felt a more bloody stroke
since the persecution of Hadrian. A remnant was saved by the firmness of
their bishops, who accepted a feigned and transient conversion; but the
more obstinate Jews opposed their fanaticism to the fanaticism of the
Christians, barricadoed their houses, and precipitating themselves,
their families, and their wealth, into the rivers or the flames,
disappointed the malice, or at least the avarice, of their implacable
foes.

[Footnote 35: Fuit et aliud scelus detestabile in hac congregatione
pedestris populi stulti et vesanae levitatis, anserem quendam divino
spiritu asserebant afflatum, et capellam non minus eodem repletam, et
has sibi duces secundae viae fecerant, &c., (Albert. Aquensis, l. i.
c. 31, p. 196.) Had these peasants founded an empire, they might have
introduced, as in Egypt, the worship of animals, which their philosophic
descend ants would have glossed over with some specious and subtile
allegory. * Note: A singular "allegoric" explanation of this strange
fact has recently been broached: it is connected with the charge of
idolatry and Eastern heretical opinions subsequently made against
the Templars. "We have no doubt that they were Manichee or Gnostic
standards." (The author says the animals themselves were carried before
the army.--M.) "The goose, in Egyptian symbols, as every Egyptian
scholar knows, meant 'divine Son,' or 'Son of God.' The goat meant
Typhon, or Devil. Thus we have the Manichee opposing principles of good
and evil, as standards, at the head of the ignorant mob of crusading
invaders. Can any one doubt that a large portion of this host must have
been infected with the Manichee or Gnostic idolatry?" Account of the
Temple Church by R. W. Billings, p. 5 London. 1838. This is, at all
events, a curious coincidence, especially considered in connection with
the extensive dissemination of the Paulician opinions among the common
people of Europe. At any rate, in so inexplicable a matter, we are
inclined to catch at any explanation, however wild or subtile.--M.]

[Footnote 36: Benjamin of Tudela describes the state of his Jewish
brethren from Cologne along the Rhine: they were rich, generous,
learned, hospitable, and lived in the eager hope of the Messiah,
(Voyage, tom. i. p. 243-245, par Baratier.) In seventy years (he wrote
about A.D. 1170) they had recovered from these massacres.]

[Footnote 37: These massacres and depredations on the Jews, which
were renewed at each crusade, are coolly related. It is true, that St.
Bernard (epist. 363, tom. i. p. 329) admonishes the Oriental Franks, non
sunt persequendi Judaei, non sunt trucidandi. The contrary doctrine had
been preached by a rival monk. * Note: This is an unjust sarcasm against
St. Bernard. He stood above all rivalry of this kind See note 31, c. l
x.--M]

Between the frontiers of Austria and the seat of the Byzan tine
monarchy, the crusaders were compelled to traverse as interval of six
hundred miles; the wild and desolate countries of Hungary [38] and
Bulgaria. The soil is fruitful, and intersected with rivers; but it
was then covered with morasses and forests, which spread to a boundless
extent, whenever man has ceased to exercise his dominion over the earth.
Both nations had imbibed the rudiments of Christianity; the Hungarians
were ruled by their native princes; the Bulgarians by a lieutenant of
the Greek emperor; but, on the slightest provocation, their ferocious
nature was rekindled, and ample provocation was afforded by the
disorders of the first pilgrims Agriculture must have been unskilful
and languid among a people, whose cities were built of reeds and timber,
which were deserted in the summer season for the tents of hunters and
shepherds. A scanty supply of provisions was rudely demanded, forcibly
seized, and greedily consumed; and on the first quarrel, the crusaders
gave a loose to indignation and revenge. But their ignorance of the
country, of war, and of discipline, exposed them to every snare. The
Greek praefect of Bulgaria commanded a regular force; [381] at the
trumpet of the Hungarian king, the eighth or the tenth of his martial
subjects bent their bows and mounted on horseback; their policy was
insidious, and their retaliation on these pious robbers was unrelenting
and bloody. [39] About a third of the naked fugitives (and the hermit
Peter was of the number) escaped to the Thracian mountains; and
the emperor, who respected the pilgrimage and succor of the Latins,
conducted them by secure and easy journeys to Constantinople, and
advised them to await the arrival of their brethren. For a while they
remembered their faults and losses; but no sooner were they revived by
the hospitable entertainment, than their venom was again inflamed; they
stung their benefactor, and neither gardens, nor palaces, nor churches,
were safe from their depredations. For his own safety, Alexius allured
them to pass over to the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus; but their blind
impetuosity soon urged them to desert the station which he had assigned,
and to rush headlong against the Turks, who occupied the road to
Jerusalem. The hermit, conscious of his shame, had withdrawn from the
camp to Constantinople; and his lieutenant, Walter the Penniless, who
was worthy of a better command, attempted without success to introduce
some order and prudence among the herd of savages. They separated in
quest of prey, and themselves fell an easy prey to the arts of the
sultan. By a rumor that their foremost companions were rioting in the
spoils of his capital, Soliman [391] tempted the main body to descend
into the plain of Nice: they were overwhelmed by the Turkish arrows; and
a pyramid of bones [40] informed their companions of the place of their
defeat. Of the first crusaders, three hundred thousand had already
perished, before a single city was rescued from the infidels, before
their graver and more noble brethren had completed the preparations of
their enterprise. [41]

[Footnote 38: See the contemporary description of Hungary in Otho of
Frisin gen, l. ii. c. 31, in Muratori, Script. Rerum Italicarum, tom.
vi. p. 665 666.]

[Footnote 381: The narrative of the first march is very incorrect. The
first party moved under Walter de Pexego and Walter the Penniless: they
passed safe through Hungary, the kingdom of Kalmeny, and were attacked
in Bulgaria. Peter followed with 40,000 men; passed through Hungary;
but seeing the clothes of sixteen crusaders, who had been empaled on the
walls of Semlin. he attacked and stormed the city. He then marched to
Nissa, where, at first, he was hospitably received: but an accidental
quar rel taking place, he suffered a great defeat. Wilken, vol. i. p.
84-86--M.]

[Footnote 39: The old Hungarians, without excepting Turotzius, are ill
informed of the first crusade, which they involve in a single passage.
Katona, like ourselves, can only quote the writers of France; but he
compares with local science the ancient and modern geography. Ante
portam Cyperon, is Sopron or Poson; Mallevilla, Zemlin; Fluvius
Maroe, Savus; Lintax, Leith; Mesebroch, or Merseburg, Ouar, or Moson;
Tollenburg, Pragg, (de Regibus Hungariae, tom. iii. p. 19-53.)]

[Footnote 391: Soliman had been killed in 1085, in a battle against
Toutoneh, brother of Malek Schah, between Appelo and Antioch. It was
not Soliman, therefore, but his son David, surnamed Kilidje Arslan,
the "Sword of the Lion," who reigned in Nice. Almost all the occidental
authors have fallen into this mistake, which was detected by M.
Michaud, Hist. des Crois. 4th edit. and Extraits des Aut. Arab. rel. aux
Croisades, par M. Reinaud Paris, 1829, p. 3. His kingdom extended from
the Orontes to the Euphra tes, and as far as the Bosphorus. Kilidje
Arslan must uniformly be substituted for Soliman. Brosset note on Le
Beau, tom. xv. p. 311.--M.]

[Footnote 40: Anna Comnena (Alexias, l. x. p. 287) describes this as a
mountain. In the siege of Nice, such were used by the Franks themselves
as the materials of a wall.]

"To save time and space, I shall represent, in a short table, the
particular references to the great events of the first crusade."


    [See Table 1.: Events Of The First Crusade]

None of the great sovereigns of Europe embarked their persons in the
first crusade. The emperor Henry the Fourth was not disposed to obey
the summons of the pope: Philip the First of France was occupied by his
pleasures; William Rufus of England by a recent conquest; the kin`gs of
Spain were engaged in a domestic war against the Moors; and the northern
monarchs of Scotland, Denmark, [42] Sweden, and Poland, were yet
strangers to the passions and interests of the South. The religious
ardor was more strongly felt by the princes of the second order, who
held an important place in the feudal system. Their situation will
naturally cast under four distinct heads the review of their names and
characters; but I may escape some needless repetition, by observing at
once, that courage and the exercise of arms are the common attribute of
these Christian adventurers. I. The first rank both in war and council
is justly due to Godfrey of Bouillon; and happy would it have been for
the crusaders, if they had trusted themselves to the sole conduct of
that accomplished hero, a worthy representative of Charlemagne, from
whom he was descended in the female line. His father was of the noble
race of the counts of Boulogne: Brabant, the lower province of Lorraine,
[43] was the inheritance of his mother; and by the emperor's bounty he
was himself invested with that ducal title, which has been improperly
transferred to his lordship of Bouillon in the Ardennes. [44] In the
service of Henry the Fourth, he bore the great standard of the empire,
and pierced with his lance the breast of Rodolph, the rebel king:
Godfrey was the first who ascended the walls of Rome; and his sickness,
his vow, perhaps his remorse for bearing arms against the pope,
confirmed an early resolution of visiting the holy sepulchre, not as
a pilgrim, but a deliverer. His valor was matured by prudence and
moderation; his piety, though blind, was sincere; and, in the tumult
of a camp, he practised the real and fictitious virtues of a convent.
Superior to the private factions of the chiefs, he reserved his enmity
for the enemies of Christ; and though he gained a kingdom by the
attempt, his pure and disinterested zeal was acknowledged by his rivals.
Godfrey of Bouillon [45] was accompanied by his two brothers, by Eustace
the elder, who had succeeded to the county of Boulogne, and by the
younger, Baldwin, a character of more ambiguous virtue. The duke of
Lorraine, was alike celebrated on either side of the Rhine: from his
birth and education, he was equally conversant with the French and
Teutonic languages: the barons of France, Germany, and Lorraine,
assembled their vassals; and the confederate force that marched under
his banner was composed of fourscore thousand foot and about ten
thousand horse. II. In the parliament that was held at Paris, in the
king's presence, about two months after the council of Clermont, Hugh,
count of Vermandois, was the most conspicuous of the princes who assumed
the cross. But the appellation of the Great was applied, not so much to
his merit or possessions, (though neither were contemptible,) as to the
royal birth of the brother of the king of France. [46] Robert, duke
of Normandy, was the eldest son of William the Conqueror; but on his
father's death he was deprived of the kingdom of England, by his own
indolence and the activity of his brother Rufus. The worth of Robert was
degraded by an excessive levity and easiness of temper: his cheerfulness
seduced him to the indulgence of pleasure; his profuse liberality
impoverished the prince and people; his indiscriminate clemency
multiplied the number of offenders; and the amiable qualities of
a private man became the essential defects of a sovereign. For the
trifling sum of ten thousand marks, he mortgaged Normandy during his
absence to the English usurper; [47] but his engagement and behavior in
the holy war announced in Robert a reformation of manners, and restored
him in some degree to the public esteem. Another Robert was count of
Flanders, a royal province, which, in this century, gave three queens to
the thrones of France, England, and Denmark: he was surnamed the
Sword and Lance of the Christians; but in the exploits of a soldier he
sometimes forgot the duties of a general. Stephen, count of Chartres, of
Blois, and of Troyes, was one of the richest princes of the age; and
the number of his castles has been compared to the three hundred and
sixty-five days of the year. His mind was improved by literature; and,
in the council of the chiefs, the eloquent Stephen [48] was chosen to
discharge the office of their president. These four were the principal
leaders of the French, the Normans, and the pilgrims of the British
isles: but the list of the barons who were possessed of three or four
towns would exceed, says a contemporary, the catalogue of the Trojan
war. [49] III. In the south of France, the command was assumed by
Adhemar bishop of Puy, the pope egate, and by Raymond count of St.
Giles and Thoulouse who added the prouder titles of duke of Narbonne
and marquis of Provence. The former was a respectable prelate, alike
qualified for this world and the next. The latter was a veteran warrior,
who had fought against the Saracens of Spain, and who consecrated
his declining age, not only to the deliverance, but to the perpetual
service, of the holy sepulchre. His experience and riches gave him a
strong ascendant in the Christian camp, whose distress he was often
able, and sometimes willing, to relieve. But it was easier for him to
extort the praise of the Infidels, than to preserve the love of his
subjects and associates. His eminent qualities were clouded by a temper
haughty, envious, and obstinate; and, though he resigned an ample
patrimony for the cause of God, his piety, in the public opinion, was
not exempt from avarice and ambition. [50] A mercantile, rather than
a martial, spirit prevailed among his provincials, [51] a common name,
which included the natives of Auvergne and Languedoc, [52] the vassals
of the kingdom of Burgundy or Arles. From the adjacent frontier of Spain
he drew a band of hardy adventurers; as he marched through Lombardy,
a crowd of Italians flocked to his standard, and his united force
consisted of one hundred thousand horse and foot. If Raymond was the
first to enlist and the last to depart, the delay may be excused by the
greatness of his preparation and the promise of an everlasting farewell.
IV. The name of Bohemond, the son of Robert Guiscard, was already famous
by his double victory over the Greek emperor; but his father's will had
reduced him to the principality of Tarentum, and the remembrance of his
Eastern trophies, till he was awakened by the rumor and passage of the
French pilgrims. It is in the person of this Norman chief that we
may seek for the coolest policy and ambition, with a small allay of
religious fanaticism. His conduct may justify a belief that he had
secretly directed the design of the pope, which he affected to second
with astonishment and zeal: at the siege of Amalphi, his example and
discourse inflamed the passions of a confederate army; he instantly tore
his garment to supply crosses for the numerous candidates, and prepared
to visit Constantinople and Asia at the head of ten thousand horse and
twenty thousand foot. Several princes of the Norman race accompanied
this veteran general; and his cousin Tancred [53] was the partner,
rather than the servant, of the war.

In the accomplished character of Tancred we discover all the virtues of
a perfect knight, [54] the true spirit of chivalry, which inspired the
generous sentiments and social offices of man far better than the base
philosophy, or the baser religion, of the times.

might have disbelieved, the crusade and tragic death of Prince Sueno,

Cappadocia, but who still lives in the poem of Tasso, (tom. iv. p.
111-115.)]

[Footnote 52: The town of his birth, or first appanage, was consecrated
to St Aegidius, whose name, as early as the first crusade, was corrupted
by the French into St. Gilles, or St. Giles. It is situate in the Iowen

church of the foundation of Raymond, (Melanges tires d'une Grande
Bibliotheque, tom. xxxvii. p 51.)]

[Footnote 53: The mother of Tancred was Emma, sister of the great Robert
Guiscard; his father, the Marquis Odo the Good. It is singular enough,
that the family and country of so illustrious a person should be
unknown; but Muratori reasonably conjectures that he was an Italian, and
perhaps of the race of the marquises of Montferrat in Piedmont, (Script.
tom. v. p. 281, 282.)]

[Footnote 54: To gratify the childish vanity of the house of Este. Tasso
has inserted in his poem, and in the first crusade, a fabulous hero,
the brave and amorous Rinaldo, (x. 75, xvii. 66-94.) He might borrow his
name from a Rinaldo, with the Aquila bianca Estense, who vanquished,
as the standard-bearer of the Roman church, the emperor Frederic I.,
(Storia Imperiale di Ricobaldo, in Muratori Script. Ital. tom. ix. p.
360. Ariosto, Orlando Furioso, iii. 30.) But, 1. The distance of sixty
years between the youth of the two Rinaldos destroys their identity. 2.
The Storia Imperiale is a forgery of the Conte Boyardo, at the end of
the xvth century, (Muratori, p. 281-289.) 3. This Rinaldo, and his
exploits, are not less chimerical than the hero of Tasso, (Muratori,
Antichita Estense, tom. i. p. 350.)]
