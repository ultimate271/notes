## Chapter LVI: The Saracens, The Franks And The Normans.--Part II.

The Normans of Apulia were seated on the verge of the two empires; and,
according to the policy of the hour, they accepted the investiture of
their lands, from the sovereigns of Germany or Constantinople. But
the firmest title of these adventurers was the right of conquest: they
neither loved nor trusted; they were neither trusted nor beloved: the
contempt of the princes was mixed with fear, and the fear of the natives
was mingled with hatred and resentment. Every object of desire, a
horse, a woman, a garden, tempted and gratified the rapaciousness of the
strangers; [29] and the avarice of their chiefs was only colored by
the more specious names of ambition and glory. The twelve counts were
sometimes joined in the league of injustice: in their domestic quarrels
they disputed the spoils of the people: the virtues of William were
buried in his grave; and Drogo, his brother and successor, was better
qualified to lead the valor, than to restrain the violence, of his
peers. Under the reign of Constantine Monomachus, the policy, rather
than benevolence, of the Byzantine court, attempted to relieve Italy
from this adherent mischief, more grievous than a flight of Barbarians;
[30] and Argyrus, the son of Melo, was invested for this purpose with
the most lofty titles [31] and the most ample commission. The memory
of his father might recommend him to the Normans; and he had already
engaged their voluntary service to quell the revolt of Maniaces, and to
avenge their own and the public injury. It was the design of Constantine
to transplant the warlike colony from the Italian provinces to the
Persian war; and the son of Melo distributed among the chiefs the gold
and manufactures of Greece, as the first-fruits of the Imperial bounty.
But his arts were baffled by the sense and spirit of the conquerors of
Apulia: his gifts, or at least his proposals, were rejected; and they
unanimously refused to relinquish their possessions and their hopes for
the distant prospect of Asiatic fortune. After the means of persuasion
had failed, Argyrus resolved to compel or to destroy: the Latin powers
were solicited against the common enemy; and an offensive alliance was
formed of the pope and the two emperors of the East and West. The throne
of St. Peter was occupied by Leo the Ninth, a simple saint, [32] of a
temper most apt to deceive himself and the world, and whose venerable
character would consecrate with the name of piety the measures least
compatible with the practice of religion. His humanity was affected by
the complaints, perhaps the calumnies, of an injured people: the impious
Normans had interrupted the payment of tithes; and the temporal sword
might be lawfully unsheathed against the sacrilegious robbers, who were
deaf to the censures of the church. As a German of noble birth and royal
kindred, Leo had free access to the court and confidence of the emperor
Henry the Third; and in search of arms and allies, his ardent zeal
transported him from Apulia to Saxony, from the Elbe to the Tyber.
During these hostile preparations, Argyrus indulged himself in the use
of secret and guilty weapons: a crowd of Normans became the victims
of public or private revenge; and the valiant Drogo was murdered in a
church. But his spirit survived in his brother Humphrey, the third count
of Apulia. The assassins were chastised; and the son of Melo, overthrown
and wounded, was driven from the field, to hide his shame behind the
walls of Bari, and to await the tardy succor of his allies.

[Footnote 29: The biographer of St. Leo IX. pours his holy venom on the
Normans. Videns indisciplinatam et alienam gentem Normannorum, crudeli
et inaudita rabie, et plusquam Pagana impietate, adversus ecclesias Dei
insurgere, passim Christianos trucidare, &c., (Wibert, c. 6.) The honest
Apulian (l. ii. p. 259) says calmly of their accuser, Veris commiscens
fallacia.]

[Footnote 30: The policy of the Greeks, revolt of Maniaces, &c., must be
collected from Cedrenus, (tom. ii. p. 757, 758,) William Appulus, (l.
i. p 257, 258, l. ii. p. 259,) and the two Chronicles of Bari, by Lupus
Protospata, (Muratori, Script. Ital. tom. v. p. 42, 43, 44,) and an
anonymous writer, (Antiquitat, Italiae Medii Aevi, tom. i. p 31-35.)
This last is a fragment of some value.]

[Footnote 31: Argyrus received, says the anonymous Chronicle of Bari,
Imperial letters, Foederatus et Patriciatus, et Catapani et Vestatus.
In his Annals, Muratori (tom. viii. p. 426) very properly reads, or
interprets, Sevestatus, the title of Sebastos or Augustus. But in his
Antiquities, he was taught by Ducange to make it a palatine office,
master of the wardrobe.]

[Footnote 32: A Life of St. Leo IX., deeply tinged with the passions and
prejudices of the age, has been composed by Wibert, printed at
Paris, 1615, in octavo, and since inserted in the Collections of the
Bollandists, of Mabillon, and of Muratori. The public and private
history of that pope is diligently treated by M. de St. Marc. (Abrege,
tom. ii. p. 140-210, and p. 25-95, second column.)]

But the power of Constantine was distracted by a Turkish war; the mind
of Henry was feeble and irresolute; and the pope, instead of repassing
the Alps with a German army, was accompanied only by a guard of seven
hundred Swabians and some volunteers of Lorraine. In his long progress
from Mantua to Beneventum, a vile and promiscuous multitude of Italians
was enlisted under the holy standard: [33] the priest and the robber
slept in the same tent; the pikes and crosses were intermingled in the
front; and the martial saint repeated the lessons of his youth in the
order of march, of encampment, and of combat. The Normans of Apulia
could muster in the field no more than three thousand horse, with a
handful of infantry: the defection of the natives intercepted their
provisions and retreat; and their spirit, incapable of fear, was chilled
for a moment by superstitious awe. On the hostile approach of Leo, they
knelt without disgrace or reluctance before their spiritual father.
But the pope was inexorable; his lofty Germans affected to deride the
diminutive stature of their adversaries; and the Normans were informed
that death or exile was their only alternative. Flight they disdained,
and, as many of them had been three days without tasting food, they
embraced the assurance of a more easy and honorable death. They climbed
the hill of Civitella, descended into the plain, and charged in three
divisions the army of the pope. On the left, and in the centre, Richard
count of Aversa, and Robert the famous Guiscard, attacked, broke,
routed, and pursued the Italian multitudes, who fought without
discipline, and fled without shame. A harder trial was reserved for
the valor of Count Humphrey, who led the cavalry of the right wing. The
Germans [34] have been described as unskillful in the management of the
horse and the lance, but on foot they formed a strong and impenetrable
phalanx; and neither man, nor steed, nor armor, could resist the weight
of their long and two-handed swords. After a severe conflict, they were
encompassed by the squadrons returning from the pursuit; and died in the
ranks with the esteem of their foes, and the satisfaction of revenge.
The gates of Civitella were shut against the flying pope, and he was
overtaken by the pious conquerors, who kissed his feet, to implore his
blessing and the absolution of their sinful victory. The soldiers beheld
in their enemy and captive the vicar of Christ; and, though we may
suppose the policy of the chiefs, it is probable that they were infected
by the popular superstition. In the calm of retirement, the well-meaning
pope deplored the effusion of Christian blood, which must be imputed to
his account: he felt, that he had been the author of sin and scandal;
and as his undertaking had failed, the indecency of his military
character was universally condemned. [35] With these dispositions, he
listened to the offers of a beneficial treaty; deserted an alliance
which he had preached as the cause of God; and ratified the past
and future conquests of the Normans. By whatever hands they had been
usurped, the provinces of Apulia and Calabria were a part of the
donation of Constantine and the patrimony of St. Peter: the grant
and the acceptance confirmed the mutual claims of the pontiff and the
adventurers. They promised to support each other with spiritual and
temporal arms; a tribute or quitrent of twelve pence was afterwards
stipulated for every ploughland; and since this memorable transaction,
the kingdom of Naples has remained above seven hundred years a fief of
the Holy See. [36]

[Footnote 33: See the expedition of Leo XI. against the Normans. See
William Appulus (l. ii. p. 259-261) and Jeffrey Malaterra (l. i. c. 13,
14, 15, p. 253.) They are impartial, as the national is counterbalanced
by the clerical prejudice]

[Footnote 34:

     Corpora derident Normannica quae breviora

The verses of the Apulian are commonly in this strain, though he heats
himself a little in the battle. Two of his similes from hawking and
sorcery are descriptive of manners.]

[Footnote 35: Several respectable censures or complaints are produced by
M. de St. Marc, (tom. ii. p. 200-204.) As Peter Damianus, the oracle
of the times, has denied the popes the right of making war, the hermit
(lugens eremi incola) is arraigned by the cardinal, and Baronius (Annal.
Eccles. A.D. 1053, No. 10-17) most strenuously asserts the two swords of
St. Peter.]

[Footnote 36: The origin and nature of the papal investitures are ably
discussed by Giannone, (Istoria Civile di Napoli, tom. ii. p. 37-49,
57-66,) as a lawyer and antiquarian. Yet he vainly strives to reconcile
the duties of patriot and Catholic, adopts an empty distinction of
"Ecclesia Romana non dedit, sed accepit," and shrinks from an honest but
dangerous confession of the truth.]

The pedigree of Robert of Guiscard [37] is variously deduced from the
peasants and the dukes of Normandy: from the peasants, by the pride and
ignorance of a Grecian princess; [38] from the dukes, by the ignorance
and flattery of the Italian subjects. [39] His genuine descent may be
ascribed to the second or middle order of private nobility. [40]
He sprang from a race of valvassors or bannerets, of the diocese of
Coutances, in the Lower Normandy: the castle of Hauteville was their
honorable seat: his father Tancred was conspicuous in the court and army
of the duke; and his military service was furnished by ten soldiers or
knights. Two marriages, of a rank not unworthy of his own, made him
the father of twelve sons, who were educated at home by the impartial
tenderness of his second wife. But a narrow patrimony was insufficient
for this numerous and daring progeny; they saw around the neighborhood
the mischiefs of poverty and discord, and resolved to seek in foreign
wars a more glorious inheritance. Two only remained to perpetuate
the race, and cherish their father's age: their ten brothers, as they
successfully attained the vigor of manhood, departed from the castle,
passed the Alps, and joined the Apulian camp of the Normans. The elder
were prompted by native spirit; their success encouraged their younger
brethren, and the three first in seniority, William, Drogo, and
Humphrey, deserved to be the chiefs of their nation and the founders of
the new republic. Robert was the eldest of the seven sons of the second
marriage; and even the reluctant praise of his foes has endowed him with
the heroic qualities of a soldier and a statesman. His lofty stature
surpassed the tallest of his army: his limbs were cast in the true
proportion of strength and gracefulness; and to the decline of life, he
maintained the patient vigor of health and the commanding dignity of his
form. His complexion was ruddy, his shoulders were broad, his hair and
beard were long and of a flaxen color, his eyes sparkled with fire, and
his voice, like that of Achilles, could impress obedience and terror
amidst the tumult of battle. In the ruder ages of chivalry, such
qualifications are not below the notice of the poet or historians: they
may observe that Robert, at once, and with equal dexterity, could wield
in the right hand his sword, his lance in the left; that in the battle
of Civitella he was thrice unhorsed; and that in the close of that
memorable day he was adjudged to have borne away the prize of valor from
the warriors of the two armies. [41] His boundless ambition was founded
on the consciousness of superior worth: in the pursuit of greatness, he
was never arrested by the scruples of justice, and seldom moved by the
feelings of humanity: though not insensible of fame, the choice of open
or clandestine means was determined only by his present advantage. The
surname of Guiscard [42] was applied to this master of political wisdom,
which is too often confounded with the practice of dissimulation and
deceit; and Robert is praised by the Apulian poet for excelling the
cunning of Ulysses and the eloquence of Cicero. Yet these arts were
disguised by an appearance of military frankness: in his highest
fortune, he was accessible and courteous to his fellow-soldiers; and
while he indulged the prejudices of his new subjects, he affected in
his dress and manners to maintain the ancient fashion of his country. He
grasped with a rapacious, that he might distribute with a liberal, hand:
his primitive indigence had taught the habits of frugality; the gain of
a merchant was not below his attention; and his prisoners were tortured
with slow and unfeeling cruelty, to force a discovery of their secret
treasure. According to the Greeks, he departed from Normandy with only
five followers on horseback and thirty on foot; yet even this allowance
appears too bountiful: the sixth son of Tancred of Hauteville passed
the Alps as a pilgrim; and his first military band was levied among
the adventurers of Italy. His brothers and countrymen had divided the
fertile lands of Apulia; but they guarded their shares with the jealousy
of avarice; the aspiring youth was driven forwards to the mountains of
Calabria, and in his first exploits against the Greeks and the natives,
it is not easy to discriminate the hero from the robber. To surprise
a castle or a convent, to ensnare a wealthy citizen, to plunder the
adjacent villages for necessary food, were the obscure labors which
formed and exercised the powers of his mind and body. The volunteers of
Normandy adhered to his standard; and, under his command, the peasants
of Calabria assumed the name and character of Normans.

[Footnote 37: The birth, character, and first actions of Robert
Guiscard, may be found in Jeffrey Malaterra, (l. i. c. 3, 4, 11, 16,
17, 18, 38, 39, 40,) William Appulus, (l. ii. p. 260-262,) William
Gemeticensis, or of Jumieges, (l. xi. c. 30, p. 663, 664, edit. Camden,)
and Anna Comnena, (Alexiad, l. i. p. 23-27, l. vi. p. 165, 166,) with
the annotations of Ducange, (Not. in Alexiad, p. 230-232, 320,) who
has swept all the French and Latin Chronicles for supplemental
intelligence.]

[Footnote 38: (a Greek corruption), and elsewhere, (l. iv. p. 84,).
Anna Comnena was born in the purple; yet her father was no more than a
private though illustrious subject, who raised himself to the empire.]

[Footnote 39: Giannone, (tom. ii. p. 2) forgets all his original
authors, and rests this princely descent on the credit of Inveges,
an Augustine monk of Palermo in the last century. They continue the
succession of dukes from Rollo to William II. the Bastard or Conqueror,
whom they hold (communemente si tiene) to be the father of Tancred of
Hauteville; a most strange and stupendous blunder! The sons of Tancred
fought in Apulia, before William II. was three years old, (A.D. 1037.)]

[Footnote 40: The judgment of Ducange is just and moderate: Certe
humilis fuit ac tenuis Roberti familia, si ducalem et regium spectemus
apicem, ad quem postea pervenit; quae honesta tamen et praeter nobilium
vulgarium statum et conditionem illustris habita est, "quae nec humi
reperet nec altum quid tumeret." (Wilhem. Malmsbur. de Gestis Anglorum,
l. iii. p. 107. Not. ad Alexiad. p. 230.)]

[Footnote 41: I shall quote with pleasure some of the best lines of the
Apulian, (l. ii. p. 270.)

     Pugnat utraque manu, nec lancea cassa, nec ensis

     Cassus erat, quocunque manu deducere vellet.

     Ter dejectus equo, ter viribus ipse resumptis

     Major in arma redit: stimulos furor ipse ministrat.

     Ut Leo cum frendens, &c.

     -   --  --  --  --  --   -

     Nullus in hoc bello sicuti post bella probatum est

     Victor vel victus, tam magnos edidit ictus.]

[Footnote 42: The Norman writers and editors most conversant with their
own idiom interpret Guiscard or Wiscard, by Callidus, a cunning man. The
root (wise) is familiar to our ear; and in the old word Wiseacre, I
can discern something of a similar sense and termination. It is no bad
translation of the surname and character of Robert.]

As the genius of Robert expanded with his fortune, he awakened the
jealousy of his elder brother, by whom, in a transient quarrel, his life
was threatened and his liberty restrained. After the death of Humphrey,
the tender age of his sons excluded them from the command; they were
reduced to a private estate, by the ambition of their guardian and
uncle; and Guiscard was exalted on a buckler, and saluted count of
Apulia and general of the republic. With an increase of authority and of
force, he resumed the conquest of Calabria, and soon aspired to a rank
that should raise him forever above the heads of his equals.

By some acts of rapine or sacrilege, he had incurred a papal
excommunication; but Nicholas the Second was easily persuaded that the
divisions of friends could terminate only in their mutual prejudice;
that the Normans were the faithful champions of the Holy See; and it
was safer to trust the alliance of a prince than the caprice of an
aristocracy. A synod of one hundred bishops was convened at Melphi; and
the count interrupted an important enterprise to guard the person and
execute the decrees of the Roman pontiff. His gratitude and policy
conferred on Robert and his posterity the ducal title, [43] with the
investiture of Apulia, Calabria, and all the lands, both in Italy and
Sicily, which his sword could rescue from the schismatic Greeks and the
unbelieving Saracens. [44] This apostolic sanction might justify his
arms; but the obedience of a free and victorious people could not be
transferred without their consent; and Guiscard dissembled his elevation
till the ensuing campaign had been illustrated by the conquest of
Consenza and Reggio. In the hour of triumph, he assembled his troops,
and solicited the Normans to confirm by their suffrage the judgment of
the vicar of Christ: the soldiers hailed with joyful acclamations their
valiant duke; and the counts, his former equals, pronounced the oath
of fidelity with hollow smiles and secret indignation. After this
inauguration, Robert styled himself, "By the grace of God and St. Peter,
duke of Apulia, Calabria, and hereafter of Sicily;" and it was the labor
of twenty years to deserve and realize these lofty appellations. Such
sardy progress, in a narrow space, may seem unworthy of the abilities
of the chief and the spirit of the nation; but the Normans were few in
number; their resources were scanty; their service was voluntary and
precarious. The bravest designs of the duke were sometimes opposed by
the free voice of his parliament of barons: the twelve counts of popular
election conspired against his authority; and against their perfidious
uncle, the sons of Humphrey demanded justice and revenge. By his policy
and vigor, Guiscard discovered their plots, suppressed their rebellions,
and punished the guilty with death or exile: but in these domestic
feuds, his years, and the national strength, were unprofitably consumed.
After the defeat of his foreign enemies, the Greeks, Lombards, and
Saracens, their broken forces retreated to the strong and populous
cities of the sea-coast. They excelled in the arts of fortification and
defence; the Normans were accustomed to serve on horseback in the field,
and their rude attempts could only succeed by the efforts of persevering
courage. The resistance of Salerno was maintained above eight months;
the siege or blockade of Bari lasted near four years. In these actions
the Norman duke was the foremost in every danger; in every fatigue the
last and most patient. As he pressed the citadel of Salerno, a huge
stone from the rampart shattered one of his military engines; and by
a splinter he was wounded in the breast. Before the gates of Bari, he
lodged in a miserable hut or barrack, composed of dry branches, and
thatched with straw; a perilous station, on all sides open to the
inclemency of the winter and the spears of the enemy. [45]

[Footnote 43: The acquisition of the ducal title by Robert Guiscard is
a nice and obscure business. With the good advice of Giannone, Muratori,
and St. Marc, I have endeavored to form a consistent and probable
narrative.]

[Footnote 44: Baronius (Annal. Eccles. A.D. 1059, No. 69) has published
the original act. He professes to have copied it from the Liber Censuum,
a Vatican Ms. Yet a Liber Censuum of the xiith century has been printed
by Muratori, (Antiquit. Medii Aevi, tom. v. p. 851-908;) and the names
of Vatican and Cardinal awaken the suspicions of a Protestant, and even
of a philosopher.]

[Footnote 45: Read the life of Guiscard in the second and third books of
the Apulian, the first and second books of Malaterra.]

The Italian conquests of Robert correspond with the limits of the
present kingdom of Naples; and the countries united by his arms have
not been dissevered by the revolutions of seven hundred years. [46]
The monarchy has been composed of the Greek provinces of Calabria and
Apulia, of the Lombard principality of Salerno, the republic of
Amalphi, and the inland dependencies of the large and ancient duchy of
Beneventum. Three districts only were exempted from the common law
of subjection; the first forever, the two last till the middle of the
succeeding century. The city and immediate territory of Benevento had
been transferred, by gift or exchange, from the German emperor to the
Roman pontiff; and although this holy land was sometimes invaded, the
name of St. Peter was finally more potent than the sword of the Normans.
Their first colony of Aversa subdued and held the state of Capua; and
her princes were reduced to beg their bread before the palace of their
fathers. The dukes of Naples, the present metropolis, maintained the
popular freedom, under the shadow of the Byzantine empire. Among the new
acquisitions of Guiscard, the science of Salerno, [47] and the trade of
Amalphi, [48] may detain for a moment the curiosity of the reader. I. Of
the learned faculties, jurisprudence implies the previous establishment
of laws and property; and theology may perhaps be superseded by the full
light of religion and reason. But the savage and the sage must alike
implore the assistance of physic; and, if our diseases are inflamed by
luxury, the mischiefs of blows and wounds would be more frequent in
the ruder ages of society. The treasures of Grecian medicine had been
communicated to the Arabian colonies of Africa, Spain, and Sicily;
and in the intercourse of peace and war, a spark of knowledge had been
kindled and cherished at Salerno, an illustrious city, in which the men
were honest and the women beautiful. [49] A school, the first that
arose in the darkness of Europe, was consecrated to the healing art:
the conscience of monks and bishops was reconciled to that salutary and
lucrative profession; and a crowd of patients, of the most eminent rank,
and most distant climates, invited or visited the physicians of Salerno.
They were protected by the Norman conquerors; and Guiscard, though bred
in arms, could discern the merit and value of a philosopher. After a
pilgrimage of thirty-nine years, Constantine, an African Christian,
returned from Bagdad, a master of the language and learning of the
Arabians; and Salerno was enriched by the practice, the lessons, and the
writings of the pupil of Avicenna. The school of medicine has long slept
in the name of a university; but her precepts are abridged in a string
of aphorisms, bound together in the Leonine verses, or Latin rhymes, of
the twelfth century. [50] II. Seven miles to the west of Salerno, and
thirty to the south of Naples, the obscure town of Amalphi displayed the
power and rewards of industry. The land, however fertile, was of narrow
extent; but the sea was accessible and open: the inhabitants first
assumed the office of supplying the western world with the manufactures
and productions of the East; and this useful traffic was the source
of their opulence and freedom. The government was popular, under the
administration of a duke and the supremacy of the Greek emperor. Fifty
thousand citizens were numbered in the walls of Amalphi; nor was any
city more abundantly provided with gold, silver, and the objects of
precious luxury. The mariners who swarmed in her port, excelled in the
theory and practice of navigation and astronomy: and the discovery of
the compass, which has opened the globe, is owing to their ingenuity or
good fortune. Their trade was extended to the coasts, or at least to
the commodities, of Africa, Arabia, and India: and their settlements
in Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria, acquired the
privileges of independent colonies. [51] After three hundred years of
prosperity, Amalphi was oppressed by the arms of the Normans, and
sacked by the jealousy of Pisa; but the poverty of one thousand [5111]
fisherman is yet dignified by the remains of an arsenal, a cathedral,
and the palaces of royal merchants.

[Footnote 46: The conquests of Robert Guiscard and Roger I., the
exemption of Benevento and the xii provinces of the kingdom, are fairly
exposed by Giannone in the second volume of his Istoria Civile, l. ix.
x. xi and l. xvii. p. 460-470. This modern division was not established
before the time of Frederic II.]

[Footnote 47: Giannone, (tom. ii. p. 119-127,) Muratori, (Antiquitat.
Medii Aevi, tom. iii. dissert. xliv. p. 935, 936,) and Tiraboschi,
(Istoria della Letteratura Italiana,) have given an historical account
of these physicians; their medical knowledge and practice must be left
to our physicians.]

[Footnote 48: At the end of the Historia Pandectarum of Henry
Brenckmann, (Trajecti ad Rhenum, 1722, in 4to.,) the indefatigable
author has inserted two dissertations, de Republica Amalphitana, and
de Amalphi a Pisanis direpta, which are built on the testimonies of
one hundred and forty writers. Yet he has forgotten two most important
passages of the embassy of Liutprand, (A.D. 939,) which compare the
trade and navigation of Amalphi with that of Venice.]

[Footnote 49: Urbs Latii non est hac delitiosior urbe,

     Frugibus, arboribus, vinoque redundat; et unde

     Non tibi poma, nuces, non pulchra palatia desunt,

        Non species muliebris abest probitasque virorum.

     --Gulielmus Appulus, l. iii. p. 367]

[Footnote 50: Muratori carries their antiquity above the year (1066)
of the death of Edward the Confessor, the rex Anglorum to whom they are
addressed. Nor is this date affected by the opinion, or rather mistake,
of Pasquier (Recherches de la France, l. vii. c. 2) and Ducange,
(Glossar. Latin.) The practice of rhyming, as early as the viith
century, was borrowed from the languages of the North and East,
(Muratori, Antiquitat. tom. iii. dissert. xl. p. 686-708.)]

[Footnote 51: The description of Amalphi, by William the Apulian, (l.
iii. p. 267,) contains much truth and some poetry, and the third line
may be applied to the sailor's compass:--

     Nulla magis locuples argento, vestibus, auro

     Partibus innumeris: hac plurimus urbe moratur

     Nauta maris Caelique vias aperire peritus.

     Huc et Alexandri diversa feruntur ab urbe

     Regis, et Antiochi.  Gens haec freta plurima transit.

     His Arabes, Indi, Siculi nascuntur et Afri.

     Haec gens est totum proore nobilitata per orbem,

     Et mercando forens, et amans mercata referre.]

[Footnote 5111: Amalfi had only one thousand inhabitants at the
commencement of the 18th century, when it was visited by Brenckmann,
(Brenckmann de Rep. Amalph. Diss. i. c. 23.) At present it has six or
eight thousand Hist. des Rep. tom. i. p. 304.--G.]
