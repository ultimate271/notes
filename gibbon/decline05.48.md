## Chapter LVIII: The First Crusade.--Part V.

Jerusalem has derived some reputation from the number and importance of
her memorable sieges. It was not till after a long and obstinate contest
that Babylon and Rome could prevail against the obstinacy of the people,
the craggy ground that might supersede the necessity of fortifications,
and the walls and towers that would have fortified the most accessible
plain. [105] These obstacles were diminished in the age of the crusades.
The bulwarks had been completely destroyed and imperfectly restored: the
Jews, their nation, and worship, were forever banished; but nature is
less changeable than man, and the site of Jerusalem, though somewhat
softened and somewhat removed, was still strong against the assaults
of an enemy. By the experience of a recent siege, and a three years'
possession, the Saracens of Egypt had been taught to discern, and in
some degree to remedy, the defects of a place, which religion as well
as honor forbade them to resign. Aladin, or Iftikhar, the caliph's
lieutenant, was intrusted with the defence: his policy strove to
restrain the native Christians by the dread of their own ruin and
that of the holy sepulchre; to animate the Moslems by the assurance of
temporal and eternal rewards. His garrison is said to have consisted
of forty thousand Turks and Arabians; and if he could muster twenty
thousand of the inhabitants, it must be confessed that the besieged were
more numerous than the besieging army. [106] Had the diminished strength
and numbers of the Latins allowed them to grasp the whole circumference
of four thousand yards, (about two English miles and a half, [107] to
what useful purpose should they have descended into the valley of Ben
Hinnom and torrent of Cedron, [108] or approach the precipices of the
south and east, from whence they had nothing either to hope or fear?
Their siege was more reasonably directed against the northern and
western sides of the city. Godfrey of Bouillon erected his standard on
the first swell of Mount Calvary: to the left, as far as St. Stephen's
gate, the line of attack was continued by Tancred and the two Roberts;
and Count Raymond established his quarters from the citadel to the foot
of Mount Sion, which was no longer included within the precincts of the
city. On the fifth day, the crusaders made a general assault, in the
fanatic hope of battering down the walls without engines, and of scaling
them without ladders. By the dint of brutal force, they burst the first
barrier; but they were driven back with shame and slaughter to the camp:
the influence of vision and prophecy was deadened by the too frequent
abuse of those pious stratagems; and time and labor were found to be
the only means of victory. The time of the siege was indeed fulfilled
in forty days, but they were forty days of calamity and anguish. A
repetition of the old complaint of famine may be imputed in some degree
to the voracious or disorderly appetite of the Franks; but the stony
soil of Jerusalem is almost destitute of water; the scanty springs and
hasty torrents were dry in the summer season; nor was the thirst of the
besiegers relieved, as in the city, by the artificial supply of cisterns
and aqueducts. The circumjacent country is equally destitute of trees
for the uses of shade or building, but some large beams were discovered
in a cave by the crusaders: a wood near Sichem, the enchanted grove of
Tasso, [109] was cut down: the necessary timber was transported to the
camp by the vigor and dexterity of Tancred; and the engines were framed
by some Genoese artists, who had fortunately landed in the harbor of
Jaffa. Two movable turrets were constructed at the expense, and in the
stations, of the duke of Lorraine and the count of Tholouse, and rolled
forwards with devout labor, not to the most accessible, but to the most
neglected, parts of the fortification. Raymond's Tower was reduced to
ashes by the fire of the besieged, but his colleague was more vigilant
and successful; [1091] the enemies were driven by his archers from the
rampart; the draw-bridge was let down; and on a Friday, at three in the
afternoon, the day and hour of the passion, Godfrey of Bouillon stood
victorious on the walls of Jerusalem. His example was followed on every
side by the emulation of valor; and about four hundred and sixty years
after the conquest of Omar, the holy city was rescued from the Mahometan
yoke. In the pillage of public and private wealth, the adventurers had
agreed to respect the exclusive property of the first occupant; and the
spoils of the great mosque, seventy lamps and massy vases of gold
and silver, rewarded the diligence, and displayed the generosity, of
Tancred. A bloody sacrifice was offered by his mistaken votaries to the
God of the Christians: resistance might provoke but neither age nor sex
could mollify, their implacable rage: they indulged themselves three
days in a promiscuous massacre; [110] and the infection of the dead
bodies produced an epidemical disease. After seventy thousand Moslems
had been put to the sword, and the harmless Jews had been burnt in
their synagogue, they could still reserve a multitude of captives, whom
interest or lassitude persuaded them to spare. Of these savage heroes of
the cross, Tancred alone betrayed some sentiments of compassion; yet
we may praise the more selfish lenity of Raymond, who granted a
capitulation and safe-conduct to the garrison of the citadel. [111]
The holy sepulchre was now free; and the bloody victors prepared to
accomplish their vow. Bareheaded and barefoot, with contrite hearts, and
in an humble posture, they ascended the hill of Calvary, amidst the loud
anthems of the clergy; kissed the stone which had covered the Savior of
the world; and bedewed with tears of joy and penitence the monument of
their redemption. This union of the fiercest and most tender passions
has been variously considered by two philosophers; by the one, [112] as
easy and natural; by the other, [113] as absurd and incredible. Perhaps
it is too rigorously applied to the same persons and the same hour; the
example of the virtuous Godfrey awakened the piety of his companions;
while they cleansed their bodies, they purified their minds; nor shall
I believe that the most ardent in slaughter and rapine were the foremost
in the procession to the holy sepulchre.

12, 13,) who supposes that the Jewish lawgivers had provided for a
perpetual state of hostility against the rest of mankind. * Note: This
is an exaggerated inference from the words of Tacitus, who speaks of
the founders of the city, not the lawgivers. Praeviderant conditores,
ex diversitate morum, crebra bella; inde cuncta quamvis adversus loagum

[Footnote 106: The lively scepticism of Voltaire is balanced with sense
and erudition by the French author of the Esprit des Croisades, (tom.
iv. p. 386-388,) who observes, that, according to the Arabians, the
inhabitants of Jerusalem must have exceeded 200,000; that in the siege
of Titus, Josephus collects 1,300,000 Jews; that they are stated by
Tacitus himself at 600,000; and that the largest defalcation, that his
accepimus can justify, will still leave them more numerous than the
Roman army.]

a circuit of 4630 paces, or 4167 English yards, (p. 109, 110: ) from an
authentic plan, D'Anville concludes a measure nearly similar, of 1960
French toises, (p. 23-29,) in his scarce and valuable tract. For the
topography of Jerusalem, see Reland, (Palestina, tom. ii. p. 832-860.)]

[Footnote 108: Jerusalem was possessed only of the torrent of Kedron,
dry in summer, and of the little spring or brook of Siloe, (Reland,
tom. i. p. 294, 300.) Both strangers and natives complain of the want
of water, which, in time of war, was studiously aggravated. Within the
city, Tacitus mentions a perennial fountain, an aqueduct and cisterns
for rain water. The aqueduct was conveyed from the rivulet Tekos or
Etham, which is likewise mentioned by Bohadin, (in Vit. Saludio p.
238.)]

called the Tower of David.]

Eight days after this memorable event, which Pope Urban did not live to
hear, the Latin chiefs proceeded to the election of a king, to guard
and govern their conquests in Palestine. Hugh the Great, and Stephen of
Chartres, had retired with some loss of reputation, which they strove
to regain by a second crusade and an honorable death. Baldwin was
established at Edessa, and Bohemond at Antioch; and two Roberts, the
duke of Normandy [114] and the count of Flanders, preferred their fair
inheritance in the West to a doubtful competition or a barren sceptre.
The jealousy and ambition of Raymond were condemned by his own
followers, and the free, the just, the unanimous voice of the army
proclaimed Godfrey of Bouillon the first and most worthy of the
champions of Christendom. His magnanimity accepted a trust as full of
danger as of glory; but in a city where his Savior had been crowned with
thorns, the devout pilgrim rejected the name and ensigns of royalty;
and the founder of the kingdom of Jerusalem contented himself with the
modest title of Defender and Baron of the Holy Sepulchre. His government
of a single year, [115] too short for the public happiness, was
interrupted in the first fortnight by a summons to the field, by the
approach of the vizier or sultan of Egypt, who had been too slow to
prevent, but who was impatient to avenge, the loss of Jerusalem. His
total overthrow in the battle of Ascalon sealed the establishment of the
Latins in Syria, and signalized the valor of the French princes who in
this action bade a long farewell to the holy wars.

Some glory might be derived from the prodigious inequality of numbers,
though I shall not count the myriads of horse and foot [1151] on the
side of the Fatimites; but, except three thousand Ethiopians or Blacks,
who were armed with flails or scourges of iron, the Barbarians of
the South fled on the first onset, and afforded a pleasing comparison
between the active valor of the Turks and the sloth and effeminacy of
the natives of Egypt. After suspending before the holy sepulchre the
sword and standard of the sultan, the new king (he deserves the title)
embraced his departing companions, and could retain only with the
gallant Tancred three hundred knights, and two thousand foot-soldiers
for the defence of Palestine. His sovereignty was soon attacked by a new
enemy, the only one against whom Godfrey was a coward. Adhemar, bishop
of Puy, who excelled both in council and action, had been swept away in
the last plague at Antioch: the remaining ecclesiastics preserved only
the pride and avarice of their character; and their seditious clamors
had required that the choice of a bishop should precede that of a king.
The revenue and jurisdiction of the lawful patriarch were usurped by the
Latin clergy: the exclusion of the Greeks and Syrians was justified
by the reproach of heresy or schism; [116] and, under the iron yoke
of their deliverers, the Oriental Christians regretted the tolerating
government of the Arabian caliphs. Daimbert, archbishop of Pisa, had
long been trained in the secret policy of Rome: he brought a fleet
at his countrymen to the succor of the Holy Land, and was installed,
without a competitor, the spiritual and temporal head of the church.
[1161] The new patriarch [117] immediately grasped the sceptre which had
been acquired by the toil and blood of the victorious pilgrims; and both
Godfrey and Bohemond submitted to receive at his hands the investiture
of their feudal possessions. Nor was this sufficient; Daimbert claimed
the immediate property of Jerusalem and Jaffa; instead of a firm and
generous refusal, the hero negotiated with the priest; a quarter of
either city was ceded to the church; and the modest bishop was satisfied
with an eventual reversion of the rest, on the death of Godfrey without
children, or on the future acquisition of a new seat at Cairo or
Damascus.

[Footnote 114: The English ascribe to Robert of Normandy, and the
Provincials to Raymond of Tholouse, the glory of refusing the crown; but
the honest voice of tradition has preserved the memory of the ambition
and revenge (Villehardouin, No. 136) of the count of St. Giles. He died
at the siege of Tripoli, which was possessed by his descendants.]

of Tyre l. ix. c. 1-12, and in the conclusion of the Latin historians

[Footnote 117: See the claims of the patriarch Daimbert, in William of
Tyre (l. ix. c. 15-18, x. 4, 7, 9,) who asserts with marvellous candor
the independence of the conquerors and kings of Jerusalem.]

Without this indulgence, the conqueror would have almost been stripped
of his infant kingdom, which consisted only of Jerusalem and Jaffa, with
about twenty villages and towns of the adjacent country. [118] Within
this narrow verge, the Mahometans were still lodged in some impregnable
castles: and the husbandman, the trader, and the pilgrim, were exposed
to daily and domestic hostility. By the arms of Godfrey himself, and of
the two Baldwins, his brother and cousin, who succeeded to the throne,
the Latins breathed with more ease and safety; and at length they
equalled, in the extent of their dominions, though not in the millions
of their subjects, the ancient princes of Judah and Israel. [119] After
the reduction of the maritime cities of Laodicea, Tripoli, Tyre, and
Ascalon, [120] which were powerfully assisted by the fleets of Venice,
Genoa, and Pisa, and even of Flanders and Norway, [121] the range of
sea-coast from Scanderoon to the borders of Egypt was possessed by the
Christian pilgrims. If the prince of Antioch disclaimed his supremacy,
the counts of Edessa and Tripoli owned themselves the vassals of the
king of Jerusalem: the Latins reigned beyond the Euphrates; and the four
cities of Hems, Hamah, Damascus, and Aleppo, were the only relics of the
Mahometan conquests in Syria. [122] The laws and language, the manners
and titles, of the French nation and Latin church, were introduced into
these transmarine colonies. According to the feudal jurisprudence, the
principal states and subordinate baronies descended in the line of male
and female succession: [123] but the children of the first conquerors,
[124] a motley and degenerate race, were dissolved by the luxury of the
climate; the arrival of new crusaders from Europe was a doubtful
hope and a casual event. The service of the feudal tenures [125] was
performed by six hundred and sixty-six knights, who might expect the aid
of two hundred more under the banner of the count of Tripoli; and
each knight was attended to the field by four squires or archers on
horseback. [126] Five thousand and seventy sergeants, most probably
foot-soldiers, were supplied by the churches and cities; and the whole
legal militia of the kingdom could not exceed eleven thousand men, a
slender defence against the surrounding myriads of Saracens and Turks.
[127] But the firmest bulwark of Jerusalem was founded on the knights of
the Hospital of St. John, [128] and of the temple of Solomon; [129]
on the strange association of a monastic and military life, which
fanaticism might suggest, but which policy must approve. The flower of
the nobility of Europe aspired to wear the cross, and to profess the
vows, of these respectable orders; their spirit and discipline were
immortal; and the speedy donation of twenty-eight thousand farms, or
manors, [130] enabled them to support a regular force of cavalry and
infantry for the defence of Palestine. The austerity of the convent soon
evaporated in the exercise of arms; the world was scandalized by the
pride, avarice, and corruption of these Christian soldiers; their claims
of immunity and jurisdiction disturbed the harmony of the church and
state; and the public peace was endangered by their jealous emulation.
But in their most dissolute period, the knights of their hospital and
temple maintained their fearless and fanatic character: they neglected
to live, but they were prepared to die, in the service of Christ; and
the spirit of chivalry, the parent and offspring of the crusades, has
been transplanted by this institution from the holy sepulchre to the
Isle of Malta. [131]

population of thirteen millions, in a country sixty leagues in length,
and thirty broad. The honest and rational Le Clerc (Comment on 2d Samuel
xxiv. and 1st Chronicles, xxi.) aestuat angusto in limite, and mutters
his suspicion of a false transcript; a dangerous suspicion! * Note:
David determined to take a census of his vast dominions, which extended
from Lebanon to the frontiers of Egypt, from the Euphrates to the
Mediterranean. The numbers (in 2 Sam. xxiv. 9, and 1 Chron. xxi. 5)
differ; but the lowest gives 800,000 men fit to bear arms in Israel,
500,000 in Judah. Hist. of Jews, vol. i. p. 248. Gibbon has taken the
highest census in his estimate of the population, and confined the
dominions of David to Jordandic Palestine.--M.]

[Footnote 126: The sum total, and the division, ascertain the service

[Footnote 128: William of Tyre (l. xviii. c. 3, 4, 5) relates the
ignoble origin and early insolence of the Hospitallers, who soon
deserted their humble patron, St. John the Eleemosynary, for the more
august character of St. John the Baptist, (see the ineffectual struggles
of Pagi, Critica, A. D 1099, No. 14-18.) They assumed the profession of
arms about the year 1120; the Hospital was mater; the Temple filia; the
Teutonic order was founded A.D. 1190, at the siege of Acre, (Mosheim
Institut p. 389, 390.)]

Templars, would be highly valued by the historians of Malta.]

Hospitallers 19,000, to the Templars 9,000 maneria, word of much higher
import (as Ducange has rightly observed) in the English than in the
French idiom. Manor is a lordship, manoir a dwelling.]

Malthe par l'Abbe de Vertot, the reader may amuse himself with a fair,
and sometimes flattering, picture of the order, while it was employed
for the defence of Palestine. The subsequent books pursue their
emigration to Rhodes and Malta.]

The spirit of freedom, which pervades the feudal institutions, was felt
in its strongest energy by the volunteers of the cross, who elected for
their chief the most deserving of his peers. Amidst the slaves of Asia,
unconscious of the lesson or example, a model of political liberty was
introduced; and the laws of the French kingdom are derived from the
purest source of equality and justice. Of such laws, the first and
indispensable condition is the assent of those whose obedience they
require, and for whose benefit they are designed. No sooner had Godfrey
of Bouillon accepted the office of supreme magistrate, than he solicited
the public and private advice of the Latin pilgrims, who were the best
skilled in the statutes and customs of Europe. From these materials,
with the counsel and approbation of the patriarch and barons, of the
clergy and laity, Godfrey composed the Assise of Jerusalem, [132] a
precious monument of feudal jurisprudence. The new code, attested by
the seals of the king, the patriarch, and the viscount of Jerusalem,
was deposited in the holy sepulchre, enriched with the improvements of
succeeding times, and respectfully consulted as often as any doubtful
question arose in the tribunals of Palestine. With the kingdom and city
all was lost: [133] the fragments of the written law were preserved by
jealous tradition [134] and variable practice till the middle of the
thirteenth century: the code was restored by the pen of John d'Ibelin,
count of Jaffa, one of the principal feudatories; [135] and the final
revision was accomplished in the year thirteen hundred and sixty-nine,
for the use of the Latin kingdom of Cyprus. [136]

[Footnote 132: The Assises de Jerusalem, in old law French, were printed
with Beaumanoir's Coutumes de Beauvoisis, (Bourges and Paris, 1690, in
folio,) and illustrated by Gaspard Thaumas de la Thaumassiere, with a
comment and glossary. An Italian version had been published in 1534, at
Venice, for the use of the kingdom of Cyprus. * Note: See Wilken, vol.
i. p. 17, &c.,--M.]

[Footnote 133: A la terre perdue, tout fut perdu, is the vigorous
expression of the Assise, (c. 281.) Yet Jerusalem capitulated with
Saladin; the queen and the principal Christians departed in peace; and
a code so precious and so portable could not provoke the avarice of the
conquerors. I have sometimes suspected the existence of this original
copy of the Holy Sepulchre, which might be invented to sanctify and
authenticate the traditionary customs of the French in Palestine.]

[Footnote 134: A noble lawyer, Raoul de Tabarie, denied the prayer of
King Amauri, (A.D. 1195-1205,) that he would commit his knowledged to
writing, and frankly declared, que de ce qu'il savoit ne feroit-il ja
nul borjois son pareill, ne null sage homme lettre, (c. 281.)]

[Footnote 135: The compiler of this work, Jean d'Ibelin, was count of
Jaffa and Ascalon, lord of Baruth (Berytus) and Rames, and died A.D.
1266, (Sanut, l. iii. p. ii. c. 5, 8.) The family of Ibelin, which
descended from a younger brother of a count of Chartres in France, long
flourished in Palestine and Cyprus, (see the Lignages de deca Mer, or
d'Outremer, c. 6, at the end of the Assises de Jerusalem, an original
book, which records the pedigrees of the French adventurers.)]

seals and deposited in the cathedral of Nicosia, (see the preface to the
Assises.)]

The justice and freedom of the constitution were maintained by two
tribunals of unequal dignity, which were instituted by Godfrey of
Bouillon after the conquest of Jerusalem. The king, in person, presided
in the upper court, the court of the barons. Of these the four most
conspicuous were the prince of Galilee, the lord of Sidon and Caesarea,
and the counts of Jaffa and Tripoli, who, perhaps with the constable and
marshal, [137] were in a special manner the compeers and judges of
each other. But all the nobles, who held their lands immediately of
the crown, were entitled and bound to attend the king's court; and each
baron exercised a similar jurisdiction on the subordinate assemblies of
his own feudatories. The connection of lord and vassal was honorable
and voluntary: reverence was due to the benefactor, protection to the
dependant; but they mutually pledged their faith to each other; and the
obligation on either side might be suspended by neglect or dissolved
by injury. The cognizance of marriages and testaments was blended with
religion, and usurped by the clergy: but the civil and criminal causes
of the nobles, the inheritance and tenure of their fiefs, formed the
proper occupation of the supreme court. Each member was the judge and
guardian both of public and private rights. It was his duty to assert
with his tongue and sword the lawful claims of the lord; but if an
unjust superior presumed to violate the freedom or property of a vassal,
the confederate peers stood forth to maintain his quarrel by word and
deed. They boldly affirmed his innocence and his wrongs; demanded the
restitution of his liberty or his lands; suspended, after a fruitless
demand, their own service; rescued their brother from prison; and
employed every weapon in his defence, without offering direct violence
to the person of their lord, which was ever sacred in their eyes. [138]
In their pleadings, replies, and rejoinders, the advocates of the court
were subtle and copious; but the use of argument and evidence was often
superseded by judicial combat; and the Assise of Jerusalem admits in
many cases this barbarous institution, which has been slowly abolished
by the laws and manners of Europe.

[Footnote 137: The cautious John D'Ibelin argues, rather than affirms,
that Tripoli is the fourth barony, and expresses some doubt concerning
the right or pretension of the constable and marshal, (c. 323.)]

[Footnote 138: Entre seignor et homme ne n'a que la foi;.... mais tant
que l'homme doit a son seignor reverence en toutes choses, (c. 206.)
Tous les hommes dudit royaume sont par ladite Assise tenus les uns as
autres.... et en celle maniere que le seignor mette main ou face mettre
au cors ou au fie d'aucun d'yaus sans esgard et sans connoissans de
court, que tous les autres doivent venir devant le seignor, &c., (212.)
The form of their remonstrances is conceived with the noble simplicity
of freedom.]

The trial by battle was established in all criminal cases which
affected the life, or limb, or honor, of any person; and in all civil
transactions, of or above the value of one mark of silver. It appears
that in criminal cases the combat was the privilege of the accuser, who,
except in a charge of treason, avenged his personal injury, or the death
of those persons whom he had a right to represent; but wherever, from
the nature of the charge, testimony could be obtained, it was necessary
for him to produce witnesses of the fact. In civil cases, the combat was
not allowed as the means of establishing the claim of the demandant;
but he was obliged to produce witnesses who had, or assumed to have,
knowledge of the fact. The combat was then the privilege of the
defendant; because he charged the witness with an attempt by perjury to
take away his right. He came therefore to be in the same situation as
the appellant in criminal cases. It was not then as a mode of proof that
the combat was received, nor as making negative evidence, (according
to the supposition of Montesquieu; [139] but in every case the right to
offer battle was founded on the right to pursue by arms the redress of
an injury; and the judicial combat was fought on the same principle, and
with the same spirit, as a private duel. Champions were only allowed to
women, and to men maimed or past the age of sixty. The consequence of a
defeat was death to the person accused, or to the champion or witness,
as well as to the accuser himself: but in civil cases, the demandant
was punished with infamy and the loss of his suit, while his witness and
champion suffered ignominious death. In many cases it was in the option
of the judge to award or to refuse the combat: but two are specified,
in which it was the inevitable result of the challenge; if a faithful
vassal gave the lie to his compeer, who unjustly claimed any portion of
their lord's demesnes; or if an unsuccessful suitor presumed to impeach
the judgment and veracity of the court. He might impeach them, but the
terms were severe and perilous: in the same day he successively fought
all the members of the tribunal, even those who had been absent; a
single defeat was followed by death and infamy; and where none could
hope for victory, it is highly probable that none would adventure the
trial. In the Assise of Jerusalem, the legal subtlety of the count
of Jaffa is more laudably employed to elude, than to facilitate, the
judicial combat, which he derives from a principle of honor rather than
of superstition. [140]

since its publication, no work has been more read and criticized; and
the spirit of inquiry which it has excited is not the least of our
obligations to the author.]

jurisprudence (c. 80-111) I am deeply indebted to the friendship of a
learned lord, who, with an accurate and discerning eye, has surveyed the
philosophic history of law. By his studies, posterity might be

contemporaries.]

Among the causes which enfranchised the plebeians from the yoke of
feudal tyranny, the institution of cities and corporations is one of
the most powerful; and if those of Palestine are coeval with the first
crusade, they may be ranked with the most ancient of the Latin world.
Many of the pilgrims had escaped from their lords under the banner of
the cross; and it was the policy of the French princes to tempt their
stay by the assurance of the rights and privileges of freemen. It is
expressly declared in the Assise of Jerusalem, that after instituting,
for his knights and barons, the court of peers, in which he presided
himself, Godfrey of Bouillon established a second tribunal, in which
his person was represented by his viscount. The jurisdiction of this
inferior court extended over the burgesses of the kingdom; and it was
composed of a select number of the most discreet and worthy citizens,
who were sworn to judge, according to the laws of the actions and
fortunes of their equals. [141] In the conquest and settlement of new
cities, the example of Jerusalem was imitated by the kings and their
great vassals; and above thirty similar corporations were founded before
the loss of the Holy Land. Another class of subjects, the Syrians, [142]
or Oriental Christians, were oppressed by the zeal of the clergy, and
protected by the toleration of the state. Godfrey listened to their
reasonable prayer, that they might be judged by their own national laws.
A third court was instituted for their use, of limited and domestic
jurisdiction: the sworn members were Syrians, in blood, language, and
religion; but the office of the president (in Arabic, of the rais) was
sometimes exercised by the viscount of the city. At an immeasurable
distance below the nobles, the burgesses, and the strangers, the
Assise of Jerusalem condescends to mention the villains and slaves, the
peasants of the land and the captives of war, who were almost equally
considered as the objects of property. The relief or protection of these
unhappy men was not esteemed worthy of the care of the legislator;
but he diligently provides for the recovery, though not indeed for the
punishment, of the fugitives. Like hounds, or hawks, who had strayed
from the lawful owner, they might be lost and claimed: the slave and
falcon were of the same value; but three slaves, or twelve oxen, were
accumulated to equal the price of the war-horse; and a sum of three
hundred pieces of gold was fixed, in the age of chivalry, as the
equivalent of the more noble animal. [143]

[Footnote 141: Louis le Gros, who is considered as the father of this
institution in France, did not begin his reign till nine years (A.D.
1108) after Godfrey of Bouillon, (Assises, c. 2, 324.) For its origin
and effects, see the judicious remarks of Dr. Robertson, (History of
Charles V. vol. i. p. 30-36, 251-265, quarto edition.)]

[Footnote 142: Every reader conversant with the historians of the
crusades will understand by the peuple des Suriens, the Oriental
Christians, Melchites, Jacobites, or Nestorians, who had all adopted the
use of the Arabic language, (vol. iv. p. 593.)]

[Footnote 143: See the Assises de Jerusalem, (310, 311, 312.) These laws
were enacted as late as the year 1350, in the kingdom of Cyprus. In
the same century, in the reign of Edward I., I understand, from a late
publication, (of his Book of Account,) that the price of a war-horse was
not less exorbitant in England.]
