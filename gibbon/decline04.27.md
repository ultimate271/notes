## Chapter XLIV: Idea Of The Roman Jurisprudence.--Part VI.

The relation of guardian and ward, or in Roman words of tutor and pupil,
which covers so many titles of the Institutes and Pandects, [136] is of
a very simple and uniform nature. The person and property of an orphan
must always be trusted to the custody of some discreet friend. If the
deceased father had not signified his choice, the agnats, or paternal
kindred of the nearest degree, were compelled to act as the natural
guardians: the Athenians were apprehensive of exposing the infant to
the power of those most interested in his death; but an axiom of
Roman jurisprudence has pronounced, that the charge of tutelage should
constantly attend the emolument of succession. If the choice of the
father, and the line of consanguinity, afforded no efficient guardian,
the failure was supplied by the nomination of the praetor of the city,
or the president of the province. But the person whom they named to
this public office might be legally excused by insanity or blindness, by
ignorance or inability, by previous enmity or adverse interest, by the
number of children or guardianships with which he was already burdened,
and by the immunities which were granted to the useful labors of
magistrates, lawyers, physicians, and professors. Till the infant could
speak, and think, he was represented by the tutor, whose authority was
finally determined by the age of puberty. Without his consent, no act
of the pupil could bind himself to his own prejudice, though it might
oblige others for his personal benefit. It is needless to observe, that
the tutor often gave security, and always rendered an account, and that
the want of diligence or integrity exposed him to a civil and almost
criminal action for the violation of his sacred trust. The age of
puberty had been rashly fixed by the civilians at fourteen; [1361] but
as the faculties of the mind ripen more slowly than those of the body,
a curator was interposed to guard the fortunes of a Roman youth from his
own inexperience and headstrong passions. Such a trustee had been first
instituted by the praetor, to save a family from the blind havoc of a
prodigal or madman; and the minor was compelled, by the laws, to solicit
the same protection, to give validity to his acts till he accomplished
the full period of twenty-five years. Women were condemned to the
perpetual tutelage of parents, husbands, or guardians; a sex created to
please and obey was never supposed to have attained the age of reason
and experience. Such, at least, was the stern and haughty spirit of
the ancient law, which had been insensibly mollified before the time of
Justinian.

[Footnote 136: See the article of guardians and wards in the Institutes,
(l. i. tit. xiii.--xxvi.,) the Pandects, (l. xxvi. xxvii.,) and the
Code, (l. v. tit. xxviii.--lxx.)]

[Footnote 1361: Gibbon accuses the civilians of having "rashly fixed
the age of puberty at twelve or fourteen years." It was not so;
before Justinian, no law existed on this subject. Ulpian relates the
discussions which took place on this point among the different sects
of civilians. See the Institutes, l. i. tit. 22, and the fragments of
Ulpian. Nor was the curatorship obligatory for all minors.--W.]

II. The original right of property can only be justified by the accident
or merit of prior occupancy; and on this foundation it is wisely
established by the philosophy of the civilians. [137] The savage who
hollows a tree, inserts a sharp stone into a wooden handle, or applies
a string to an elastic branch, becomes in a state of nature the just
proprietor of the canoe, the bow, or the hatchet. The materials
were common to all, the new form, the produce of his time and simple
industry, belongs solely to himself. His hungry brethren cannot, without
a sense of their own injustice, extort from the hunter the game of the
forest overtaken or slain by his personal strength and dexterity. If his
provident care preserves and multiplies the tame animals, whose nature
is tractable to the arts of education, he acquires a perpetual title
to the use and service of their numerous progeny, which derives its
existence from him alone. If he encloses and cultivates a field for
their sustenance and his own, a barren waste is converted into a fertile
soil; the seed, the manure, the labor, create a new value, and the
rewards of harvest are painfully earned by the fatigues of the revolving
year. In the successive states of society, the hunter, the shepherd, the
husbandman, may defend their possessions by two reasons which forcibly
appeal to the feelings of the human mind: that whatever they enjoy is
the fruit of their own industry; and that every man who envies their
felicity, may purchase similar acquisitions by the exercise of similar
diligence. Such, in truth, may be the freedom and plenty of a small
colony cast on a fruitful island. But the colony multiplies, while the
space still continues the same; the common rights, the equal inheritance
of mankind. are engrossed by the bold and crafty; each field and forest
is circumscribed by the landmarks of a jealous master; and it is the
peculiar praise of the Roman jurisprudence, that i asserts the claim of
the first occupant to the wild animals of the earth, the air, and the
waters. In the progress from primitive equity to final injustice, the
steps are silent, the shades are almost imperceptible, and the absolute
monopoly is guarded by positive laws and artificial reason. The active,
insatiate principle of self-love can alone supply the arts of life and
the wages of industry; and as soon as civil government and exclusive
property have been introduced, they become necessary to the existence
of the human race. Except in the singular institutions of Sparta, the
wisest legislators have disapproved an agrarian law as a false and
dangerous innovation. Among the Romans, the enormous disproportion of
wealth surmounted the ideal restraints of a doubtful tradition, and an
obsolete statute; a tradition that the poorest follower of Romulus
had been endowed with the perpetual inheritance of two jugera; [138]
a statute which confined the richest citizen to the measure of five
hundred jugera, or three hundred and twelve acres of land. The original
territory of Rome consisted only of some miles of wood and meadow along
the banks of the Tyber; and domestic exchange could add nothing to the
national stock. But the goods of an alien or enemy were lawfully exposed
to the first hostile occupier; the city was enriched by the profitable
trade of war; and the blood of her sons was the only price that was paid
for the Volscian sheep, the slaves of Briton, or the gems and gold of
Asiatic kingdoms. In the language of ancient jurisprudence, which was
corrupted and forgotten before the age of Justinian, these spoils were
distinguished by the name of manceps or manicipium, taken with the hand;
and whenever they were sold or emancipated, the purchaser required some
assurance that they had been the property of an enemy, and not of
a fellow-citizen. [139] A citizen could only forfeit his rights by
apparent dereliction, and such dereliction of a valuable interest
could not easily be presumed. Yet, according to the Twelve Tables, a
prescription of one year for movables, and of two years for immovables,
abolished the claim of the ancient master, if the actual possessor had
acquired them by a fair transaction from the person whom he believed to
be the lawful proprietor. [140] Such conscientious injustice, without
any mixture of fraud or force could seldom injure the members of a small
republic; but the various periods of three, of ten, or of twenty years,
determined by Justinian, are more suitable to the latitude of a great
empire. It is only in the term of prescription that the distinction of
real and personal fortune has been remarked by the civilians; and
their general idea of property is that of simple, uniform, and absolute
dominion. The subordinate exceptions of use, of usufruct, [141] of
servitude, [142] imposed for the benefit of a neighbor on lands and
houses, are abundantly explained by the professors of jurisprudence.
The claims of property, as far as they are altered by the mixture, the
division, or the transformation of substances, are investigated with
metaphysical subtilty by the same civilians.

reasoning of Caius and Heineccius (l. ii. tit. i. p. 69-91) with the

except myself have assigned a reason, I am diffident of my own.]

[Footnote 140: From this short prescription, Hume (Essays, vol. i. p.
423) infers that there could not then be more order and settlement in
Italy than now amongst the Tartars. By the civilian of his adversary
Wallace, he is reproached, and not without reason, for overlooking the
conditions, (Institut. l. ii. tit. vi.) * Note: Gibbon acknowledges,
in the former note, the obscurity of his views with regard to the res
mancipi. The interpreters, who preceded him, are not agreed on
this point, one of the most difficult in the ancient Roman law. The
conclusions of Hume, of which the author here speaks, are grounded
on false assumptions. Gibbon had conceived very inaccurate notions of
Property among the Romans, and those of many authors in the present day
are not less erroneous. We think it right, in this place, to develop the
system of property among the Romans, as the result of the study of
the extant original authorities on the ancient law, and as it has been
demonstrated, recognized, and adopted by the most learned expositors
of the Roman law. Besides the authorities formerly known, such as the
Fragments of Ulpian, t. xix. and t. i. 16. Theoph. Paraph. i. 5, 4, may
be consulted the Institutes of Gaius, i. 54, and ii. 40, et seq.
The Roman laws protected all property acquired in a lawful manner.
They imposed on those who had invaded it, the obligation of making
restitution and reparation of all damage caused by that invasion; they
punished it moreover, in many cases, by a pecuniary fine. But they did
not always grant a recovery against the third person, who had become
bona fide possessed of the property. He who had obtained possession of a
thing belonging to another, knowing nothing of the prior rights of that
person, maintained the possession. The law had expressly determined
those cases, in which it permitted property to be reclaimed from an
innocent possessor. In these cases possession had the characters of
absolute proprietorship, called mancipium, jus Quiritium. To possess
this right, it was not sufficient to have entered into possession of the
thing in any manner; the acquisition was bound to have that character
of publicity, which was given by the observation of solemn forms,
prescribed by the laws, or the uninterrupted exercise of proprietorship
during a certain time: the Roman citizen alone could acquire this
proprietorship. Every other kind of possession, which might be named
imperfect proprietorship, was called "in bonis habere." It was not till
after the time of Cicero that the general name of Dominium was given to
all proprietorship.
It was then the publicity which constituted the distinctive character
of absolute dominion. This publicity was grounded on the mode of
acquisition, which the moderns have called Civil, (Modi adquirendi
Civiles.) These modes of acquisition were,
1. Mancipium or mancipatio, which was nothing but the solemn delivering
over of the thing in the presence of a determinate number of witnesses
and a public officer; it was from this probably that proprietorship was
named, 2. In jure cessio, which was a solemn delivering over before the
praetor. 3. Adjudicatio, made by a judge, in a case of partition.
4. Lex, which comprehended modes of acquiring in particular cases
determined by law; probably the law of the xii. tables; for instance,
the sub corona emptio and the legatum.
5. Usna, called afterwards usacapio, and by the moderns prescription.
This was only a year for movables; two years for things not movable. Its
primary object was altogether different from that of prescription in
the present day. It was originally introduced in order to transform
the simple possession of a thing (in bonis habere) into Roman
proprietorship. The public and uninterrupted possession of a thing,
enjoyed for the space of one or two years, was sufficient to make known
to the inhabitants of the city of Rome to whom the thing belonged. This
last mode of acquisition completed the system of civil acquisitions. by
legalizing. as it were, every other kind of acquisition which was not
conferred, from the commencement, by the Jus Quiritium. V. Ulpian.
Fragm. i. 16. Gaius, ii. 14. We believe, according to Gaius, 43, that
this usucaption was extended to the case where a thing had been acquired
from a person not the real proprietor; and that according to the time
prescribed, it gave to the possessor the Roman proprietorship. But this
does not appear to have been the original design of this Institution.
Caeterum etiam earum rerum usucapio nobis competit, quae non a domino
nobis tradita fuerint, si modo eas bona fide acceperimus Gaius, l ii.
43. As to things of smaller value, or those which it was difficult to
distinguish from each other, the solemnities of which we speak were not
requisite to obtain legal proprietorship.
In this case simple delivery was sufficient.
In proportion to the aggrandizement of the Republic, this latter
principle became more important from the increase of the commerce and
wealth of the state. It was necessary to know what were those things of
which absolute property might be acquired by simple delivery, and what,
on the contrary, those, the acquisition of which must be sanctioned
by these solemnities. This question was necessarily to be decided by
a general rule; and it is this rule which establishes the distinction
between res mancipi and nec mancipi, a distinction about which the
opinions of modern civilians differ so much that there are above ten
conflicting systems on the subject. The system which accords best with a
sound interpretation of the Roman laws, is that proposed by M. Trekel of
Hamburg, and still further developed by M. Hugo, who has extracted it in
the Magazine of Civil Law, vol. ii. p. 7.
This is the system now almost universally adopted. Res mancipi (by
contraction for mancipii) were things of which the absolute property
(Jus Quiritium) might be acquired only by the solemnities mentioned
above, at least by that of mancipation, which was, without doubt, the
most easy and the most usual. Gaius, ii. 25. As for other things, the
acquisition of which was not subject to these forms, in order to confer
absolute right, they were called res nec mancipi. See Ulpian, Fragm.
xix. 1. 3, 7.
Ulpian and Varro enumerate the different kinds of res mancipi. Their
enumerations do not quite agree; and various methods of reconciling them
have been attempted. The authority of Ulpian, however, who wrote as a
civilian, ought to have the greater weight on this subject.
But why are these things alone res mancipi? This is one of the questions
which have been most frequently agitated, and on which the opinions of
civilians are most divided. M. Hugo has resolved it in the most
natural and satisfactory manner. "All things which were easily known
individually, which were of great value, with which the Romans were
acquainted, and which they highly appreciated, were res mancipi. Of old
mancipation or some other solemn form was required for the acquisition
of these things, an account of their importance. Mancipation served to
prove their acquisition, because they were easily distinguished one from
the other." On this great historical discussion consult the Magazine of
Civil Law by M. Hugo, vol. ii. p. 37, 38; the dissertation of M. J. M.
Zachariae, de Rebus Mancipi et nec Mancipi Conjecturae, p. 11. Lipsiae,
1807; the History of Civil Law by M. Hugo; and my Institutiones Juris
Romani Privati p. 108, 110.
As a general rule, it may be said that all things are res nec mancipi;
the res mancipi are the exception to this principle.
The praetors changed the system of property by allowing a person, who
had a thing in bonis, the right to recover before the prescribed term
of usucaption had conferred absolute proprietorship. (Pauliana in rem
actio.) Justinian went still further, in times when there was no longer
any distinction between a Roman citizen and a stranger. He granted the
right of recovering all things which had been acquired, whether by what
were called civil or natural modes of acquisition, Cod. l. vii. t. 25,
31. And he so altered the theory of Gaius in his Institutes, ii. 1, that
no trace remains of the doctrine taught by that civilian.--W.]

country.]

The personal title of the first proprietor must be determined by
his death: but the possession, without any appearance of change, is
peaceably continued in his children, the associates of his toil, and the
partners of his wealth. This natural inheritance has been protected by
the legislators of every climate and age, and the father is encouraged
to persevere in slow and distant improvements, by the tender hope, that
a long posterity will enjoy the fruits of his labor. The principle of
hereditary succession is universal; but the order has been variously
established by convenience or caprice, by the spirit of national
institutions, or by some partial example which was originally decided
by fraud or violence. The jurisprudence of the Romans appear to have
deviated from the inequality of nature much less than the Jewish, [143]
the Athenian, [144] or the English institutions. [145] On the death of
a citizen, all his descendants, unless they were already freed from his
paternal power, were called to the inheritance of his possessions. The
insolent prerogative of primogeniture was unknown; the two sexes were
placed on a just level; all the sons and daughters were entitled to an
equal portion of the patrimonial estate; and if any of the sons had been
intercepted by a premature death, his person was represented, and his
share was divided, by his surviving children. On the failure of the
direct line, the right of succession must diverge to the collateral
branches. The degrees of kindred [146] are numbered by the civilians,
ascending from the last possessor to a common parent, and descending
from the common parent to the next heir: my father stands in the first
degree, my brother in the second, his children in the third, and the
remainder of the series may be conceived by a fancy, or pictured in
a genealogical table. In this computation, a distinction was made,
essential to the laws and even the constitution of Rome; the agnats, or
persons connected by a line of males, were called, as they stood in the
nearest degree, to an equal partition; but a female was incapable of
transmitting any legal claims; and the cognats of every rank, without
excepting the dear relation of a mother and a son, were disinherited by
the Twelve Tables, as strangers and aliens. Among the Romans agens or
lineage was united by a common name and domestic rites; the various
cognomens or surnames of Scipio, or Marcellus, distinguished from each
other the subordinate branches or families of the Cornelian or Claudian
race: the default of the agnats, of the same surname, was supplied
by the larger denomination of gentiles; and the vigilance of the laws
maintained, in the same name, the perpetual descent of religion and
property. A similar principle dictated the Voconian law, [147] which
abolished the right of female inheritance. As long as virgins were given
or sold in marriage, the adoption of the wife extinguished the hopes of
the daughter. But the equal succession of independent matrons supported
their pride and luxury, and might transport into a foreign house the
riches of their fathers.

While the maxims of Cato [148] were revered, they tended to perpetuate
in each family a just and virtuous mediocrity: till female blandishments
insensibly triumphed; and every salutary restraint was lost in the
dissolute greatness of the republic. The rigor of the decemvirs was
tempered by the equity of the praetors. Their edicts restored and
emancipated posthumous children to the rights of nature; and upon the
failure of the agnats, they preferred the blood of the cognats to the
name of the gentiles whose title and character were insensibly covered
with oblivion. The reciprocal inheritance of mothers and sons was
established in the Tertullian and Orphitian decrees by the humanity of
the senate. A new and more impartial order was introduced by the Novels
of Justinian, who affected to revive the jurisprudence of the Twelve
Tables. The lines of masculine and female kindred were confounded: the
descending, ascending, and collateral series was accurately defined;
and each degree, according tot he proximity of blood and affection,
succeeded to the vacant possessions of a Roman citizen. [149]

[Footnote 143: Among the patriarchs, the first-born enjoyed a mystic and
spiritual primogeniture, (Genesis, xxv. 31.) In the land of Canaan, he
was entitled to a double portion of inheritance, (Deuteronomy, xxi. 17,
with Le Clerc's judicious Commentary.)]

[Footnote 144: At Athens, the sons were equal; but the poor daughters
were endowed at the discretion of their brothers. See the pleadings of
Isaeus, (in the viith volume of the Greek Orators,) illustrated by the
version and comment of Sir William Jones, a scholar, a lawyer, and a man
of genius.]

[Footnote 145: In England, the eldest son also inherits all the land;
a law, says the orthodox Judge Blackstone, (Commentaries on the Laws
of England, vol. ii. p. 215,) unjust only in the opinion of younger
brothers. It may be of some political use in sharpening their industry.]

compare the decrees of the civil with those of the canon and common law.

younger Scipio, who was then 17 years of age, (Frenshemius, Supplement.
Livian. xlvi. 40,) found an occasion of exercising his generosity to his
mother, sisters, &c. (Polybius, tom. ii. l. xxxi. p. 1453--1464, edit
Gronov., a domestic witness.)]

passages.]

Novels, (cxviii.)]

The order of succession is regulated by nature, or at least by the
general and permanent reason of the lawgiver: but this order is
frequently violated by the arbitrary and partial wills, which prolong
the dominion of the testator beyond the grave. [150] In the simple state
of society, this last use or abuse of the right of property is seldom
indulged: it was introduced at Athens by the laws of Solon; and the
private testaments of the father of a family are authorized by the
Twelve Tables. Before the time of the decemvirs, [151] a Roman citizen
exposed his wishes and motives to the assembly of the thirty curiae
or parishes, and the general law of inheritance was suspended by
an occasional act of the legislature. After the permission of the
decemvirs, each private lawgiver promulgated his verbal or written
testament in the presence of five citizens, who represented the five
classes of the Roman people; a sixth witness attested their concurrence;
a seventh weighed the copper money, which was paid by an imaginary
purchaser; and the estate was emancipated by a fictitious sale and
immediate release. This singular ceremony, [152] which excited the
wonder of the Greeks, was still practised in the age of Severus; but the
praetors had already approved a more simple testament, for which they
required the seals and signatures of seven witnesses, free from all
legal exception, and purposely summoned for the execution of that
important act. A domestic monarch, who reigned over the lives and
fortunes of his children, might distribute their respective shares
according to the degrees of their merit or his affection; his arbitrary
displeasure chastised an unworthy son by the loss of his inheritance,
and the mortifying preference of a stranger. But the experience of
unnatural parents recommended some limitations of their testamentary
powers. A son, or, by the laws of Justinian, even a daughter, could no
longer be disinherited by their silence: they were compelled to name
the criminal, and to specify the offence; and the justice of the emperor
enumerated the sole causes that could justify such a violation of
the first principles of nature and society. [153] Unless a legitimate
portion, a fourth part, had been reserved for the children, they were
entitled to institute an action or complaint of inofficious testament;
to suppose that their father's understanding was impaired by sickness
or age; and respectfully to appeal from his rigorous sentence to the
deliberate wisdom of the magistrate. In the Roman jurisprudence, an
essential distinction was admitted between the inheritance and the
legacies. The heirs who succeeded to the entire unity, or to any of the
twelve fractions of the substance of the testator, represented his civil
and religious character, asserted his rights, fulfilled his obligations,
and discharged the gifts of friendship or liberality, which his last
will had bequeathed under the name of legacies. But as the imprudence or
prodigality of a dying man might exhaust the inheritance, and leave
only risk and labor to his successor, he was empowered to retain the
Falcidian portion; to deduct, before the payment of the legacies, a
clear fourth for his own emolument. A reasonable time was allowed to
examine the proportion between the debts and the estate, to decide
whether he should accept or refuse the testament; and if he used the
benefit of an inventory, the demands of the creditors could not exceed
the valuation of the effects. The last will of a citizen might be
altered during his life, or rescinded after his death: the persons whom
he named might die before him, or reject the inheritance, or be exposed
to some legal disqualification. In the contemplation of these events,
he was permitted to substitute second and third heirs, to replace each
other according to the order of the testament; and the incapacity of
a madman or an infant to bequeath his property might be supplied by a
similar substitution. [154] But the power of the testator expired with
the acceptance of the testament: each Roman of mature age and discretion
acquired the absolute dominion of his inheritance, and the simplicity of
the civil law was never clouded by the long and intricate entails which
confine the happiness and freedom of unborn generations.

[Footnote 150: That succession was the rule, testament the exception,
is proved by Taylor, (Elements of Civil Law, p. 519-527,) a learned,
rambling, spirited writer. In the iid and iiid books, the method of
the Institutes is doubtless preposterous; and the Chancellor Daguesseau
(Oeuvres, tom. i. p. 275) wishes his countryman Domat in the place of
Tribonian. Yet covenants before successions is not surely the natural
order of civil laws.]

[Footnote 151: Prior examples of testaments are perhaps fabulous. At
Athens a childless father only could make a will, (Plutarch, in Solone,
tom. i. p. 164. See Isaeus and Jones.)]

[Footnote 152: The testament of Augustus is specified by Suetonius, (in
August, c. 101, in Neron. c. 4,) who may be studied as a code of Roman
antiquities. Plutarch (Opuscul. tom. ii. p. 976) is surprised. The
language of Ulpian (Fragment. tit. xx. p. 627, edit. Schulting) is
almost too exclusive--solum in usu est.]

[Footnote 153: Justinian (Novell. cxv. No. 3, 4) enumerates only the
public and private crimes, for which a son might likewise disinherit his
father. Note: Gibbon has singular notions on the provisions of Novell.
cxv. 3, 4, which probably he did not clearly understand.--W]

[Footnote 154: The substitutions of fidei-commissaires of the modern
civil law is a feudal idea grafted on the Roman jurisprudence, and bears
scarcely any resemblance to the ancient fidei-commissa, (Institutions
du Droit Francois, tom. i. p. 347-383. Denissart, Decisions de
Jurisprudence, tom. iv. p. 577-604.) They were stretched to the
fourth degree by an abuse of the clixth Novel; a partial, perplexed,
declamatory law.]

Conquest and the formalities of law established the use of codicils. If
a Roman was surprised by death in a remote province of the empire, he
addressed a short epistle to his legitimate or testamentary heir; who
fulfilled with honor, or neglected with impunity, this last request,
which the judges before the age of Augustus were not authorized to
enforce. A codicil might be expressed in any mode, or in any language;
but the subscription of five witnesses must declare that it was the
genuine composition of the author. His intention, however laudable, was
sometimes illegal; and the invention of fidei-commissa, or trusts, arose
form the struggle between natural justice and positive jurisprudence.
A stranger of Greece or Africa might be the friend or benefactor of a
childless Roman, but none, except a fellow-citizen, could act as his
heir. The Voconian law, which abolished female succession, restrained
the legacy or inheritance of a woman to the sum of one hundred thousand
sesterces; [155] and an only daughter was condemned almost as an alien
in her father's house. The zeal of friendship, and parental affection,
suggested a liberal artifice: a qualified citizen was named in the
testament, with a prayer or injunction that he would restore the
inheritance to the person for whom it was truly intended. Various was
the conduct of the trustees in this painful situation: they had sworn
to observe the laws of their country, but honor prompted them to violate
their oath; and if they preferred their interest under the mask of
patriotism, they forfeited the esteem of every virtuous mind. The
declaration of Augustus relieved their doubts, gave a legal sanction to
confidential testaments and codicils, and gently unravelled the forms
and restraints of the republican jurisprudence. [156] But as the new
practice of trusts degenerated into some abuse, the trustee was enabled,
by the Trebellian and Pegasian decrees, to reserve one fourth of the
estate, or to transfer on the head of the real heir all the debts and
actions of the succession. The interpretation of testaments was strict
and literal; but the language of trusts and codicils was delivered from
the minute and technical accuracy of the civilians. [157]

[Footnote 155: Dion Cassius (tom. ii. l. lvi. p. 814, with Reimar's
Notes) specifies in Greek money the sum of 25,000 drachms.]

[Footnote 156: The revolutions of the Roman laws of inheritance are
finely, though sometimes fancifully, deduced by Montesquieu, (Esprit des
Loix, l. xxvii.)]

[Footnote 157: Of the civil jurisprudence of successions, testaments,
codicils, legacies, and trusts, the principles are ascertained in the
Institutes of Caius, (l. ii. tit. ii.--ix. p. 91--144,) Justinian,
(l. ii. tit. x.--xxv.,) and Theophilus, (p. 328--514;) and the immense
detail occupies twelve books (xxviii.--xxxix.) of the Pandects.] III.
The general duties of mankind are imposed by their public and private
relations: but their specific obligations to each other can only be the
effect of, 1. a promise, 2. a benefit, or 3. an injury: and when these
obligations are ratified by law, the interested party may compel the
performance by a judicial action. On this principle, the civilians of
every country have erected a similar jurisprudence, the fair conclusion
of universal reason and justice. [158]

[Footnote 158: The Institutes of Caius, (l. ii. tit. ix. x. p.
144--214,) of Justinian, (l. iii. tit. xiv.--xxx. l. iv. tit.
i.--vi.,) and of Theophilus, (p. 616--837,) distinguish four sorts of
obligations--aut re, aut verbis, aut literis aut consensu: but I confess
myself partial to my own division. Note: It is not at all applicable to
the Roman system of contracts, even if I were allowed to be good.--M.]
