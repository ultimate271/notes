## Chapter XLVII: Ecclesiastical Discord.--Part IV.

Justinian has been already seen in the various lights of a prince, a
conqueror, and a lawgiver: the theologian [80] still remains, and it
affords an unfavorable prejudice, that his theology should form a very
prominent feature of his portrait. The sovereign sympathized with
his subjects in their superstitious reverence for living and departed
saints: his Code, and more especially his Novels, confirm and enlarge
the privileges of the clergy; and in every dispute between a monk and
a layman, the partial judge was inclined to pronounce, that truth, and
innocence, and justice, were always on the side of the church. In his
public and private devotions, the emperor was assiduous and exemplary;
his prayers, vigils, and fasts, displayed the austere penance of a monk;
his fancy was amused by the hope, or belief, of personal inspiration; he
had secured the patronage of the Virgin and St. Michael the archangel;
and his recovery from a dangerous disease was ascribed to the miraculous
succor of the holy martyrs Cosmas and Damian. The capital and the
provinces of the East were decorated with the monuments of his religion;
[81] and though the far greater part of these costly structures may be
attributed to his taste or ostentation, the zeal of the royal architect
was probably quickened by a genuine sense of love and gratitude towards
his invisible benefactors. Among the titles of Imperial greatness, the
name of Pious was most pleasing to his ear; to promote the temporal and
spiritual interest of the church was the serious business of his life;
and the duty of father of his country was often sacrificed to that of
defender of the faith. The controversies of the times were congenial
to his temper and understanding and the theological professors must
inwardly deride the diligence of a stranger, who cultivated their art
and neglected his own. "What can ye fear," said a bold conspirator to
his associates, "from your bigoted tyrant? Sleepless and unarmed, he
sits whole nights in his closet, debating with reverend graybeards, and
turning over the pages of ecclesiastical volumes." [82] The fruits of
these lucubrations were displayed in many a conference, where Justinian
might shine as the loudest and most subtile of the disputants; in many a
sermon, which, under the name of edicts and epistles, proclaimed to the
empire the theology of their master. While the Barbarians invaded the
provinces, while the victorious legion marched under the banners of
Belisarius and Narses, the successor of Trajan, unknown to the camp,
was content to vanquish at the head of a synod. Had he invited to these
synods a disinterested and rational spectator, Justinian might have
learned, "that religious controversy is the offspring of arrogance
and folly; that true piety is most laudably expressed by silence and
submission; that man, ignorant of his own nature, should not presume to
scrutinize the nature of his God; and that it is sufficient for us
to know, that power and benevolence are the perfect attributes of the
Deity." [83]

[Footnote 80: The strain of the Anecdotes of Procopius, (c. 11, 13, 18,
27, 28,) with the learned remarks of Alemannus, is confirmed, rather
than contradicted, by the Acts of the Councils, the fourth book of
Evagrius, and the complaints of the African Facundus, in his
xiith book--de tribus capitulis, "cum videri doctus appetit
importune...spontaneis quaestionibus ecclesiam turbat." See Procop. de
Bell. Goth. l. iii. c. 35.]

[Footnote 81: Procop. de Edificiis, l. i. c. 6, 7, &c., passim.]

[Footnote 82: Procop. de Bell. Goth. l. iii. c. 32. In the life of St.
Eutychius (apud Aleman. ad Procop. Arcan. c. 18) the same character is
given with a design to praise Justinian.]

[Footnote 83: For these wise and moderate sentiments, Procopius (de
Bell. Goth. l. i. c. 3) is scourged in the preface of Alemannus, who
ranks him among the political Christians--sed longe verius haeresium
omnium sentinas, prorsusque Atheos--abominable Atheists, who preached
the imitation of God's mercy to man, (ad Hist. Arcan. c. 13.)]

Toleration was not the virtue of the times, and indulgence to rebels has
seldom been the virtue of princes. But when the prince descends to the
narrow and peevish character of a disputant, he is easily provoked to
supply the defect of argument by the plenitude of power, and to chastise
without mercy the perverse blindness of those who wilfully shut their
eyes against the light of demonstration. The reign of Justinian was
a uniform yet various scene of persecution; and he appears to have
surpassed his indolent predecessors, both in the contrivance of his laws
and the rigor of their execution. The insufficient term of three months
was assigned for the conversion or exile of all heretics; [84] and if he
still connived at their precarious stay, they were deprived, under
his iron yoke, not only of the benefits of society, but of the common
birth-right of men and Christians. At the end of four hundred years,
the Montanists of Phrygia [85] still breathed the wild enthusiasm of
perfection and prophecy which they had imbibed from their male and
female apostles, the special organs of the Paraclete. On the approach of
the Catholic priests and soldiers, they grasped with alacrity the
crown of martyrdom the conventicle and the congregation perished in the
flames, but these primitive fanatics were not extinguished three hundred
years after the death of their tyrant. Under the protection of their
Gothic confederates, the church of the Arians at Constantinople had
braved the severity of the laws: their clergy equalled the wealth and
magnificence of the senate; and the gold and silver which were seized by
the rapacious hand of Justinian might perhaps be claimed as the spoils
of the provinces, and the trophies of the Barbarians. A secret remnant
of Pagans, who still lurked in the most refined and most rustic
conditions of mankind, excited the indignation of the Christians, who
were perhaps unwilling that any strangers should be the witnesses of
their intestine quarrels. A bishop was named as the inquisitor of the
faith, and his diligence soon discovered, in the court and city, the
magistrates, lawyers, physicians, and sophists, who still cherished the
superstition of the Greeks. They were sternly informed that they must
choose without delay between the displeasure of Jupiter or Justinian,
and that their aversion to the gospel could no longer be distinguished
under the scandalous mask of indifference or impiety. The patrician
Photius, perhaps, alone was resolved to live and to die like his
ancestors: he enfranchised himself with the stroke of a dagger, and left
his tyrant the poor consolation of exposing with ignominy the lifeless
corpse of the fugitive. His weaker brethren submitted to their earthly
monarch, underwent the ceremony of baptism, and labored, by their
extraordinary zeal, to erase the suspicion, or to expiate the guilt,
of idolatry. The native country of Homer, and the theatre of the Trojan
war, still retained the last sparks of his mythology: by the care of
the same bishop, seventy thousand Pagans were detected and converted in
Asia, Phrygia, Lydia, and Caria; ninety-six churches were built for the
new proselytes; and linen vestments, Bibles, and liturgies, and vases
of gold and silver, were supplied by the pious munificence of Justinian.
[86] The Jews, who had been gradually stripped of their immunities,
were oppressed by a vexatious law, which compelled them to observe
the festival of Easter the same day on which it was celebrated by the
Christians. [87] And they might complain with the more reason, since the
Catholics themselves did not agree with the astronomical calculations of
their sovereign: the people of Constantinople delayed the beginning of
their Lent a whole week after it had been ordained by authority; and
they had the pleasure of fasting seven days, while meat was exposed for
sale by the command of the emperor. The Samaritans of Palestine [88]
were a motley race, an ambiguous sect, rejected as Jews by the Pagans,
by the Jews as schismatics, and by the Christians as idolaters. The
abomination of the cross had already been planted on their holy mount
of Garizim, [89] but the persecution of Justinian offered only the
alternative of baptism or rebellion. They chose the latter: under the
standard of a desperate leader, they rose in arms, and retaliated their
wrongs on the lives, the property, and the temples, of a defenceless
people. The Samaritans were finally subdued by the regular forces of the
East: twenty thousand were slain, twenty thousand were sold by the Arabs
to the infidels of Persia and India, and the remains of that unhappy
nation atoned for the crime of treason by the sin of hypocrisy. It has
been computed that one hundred thousand Roman subjects were extirpated
in the Samaritan war, [90] which converted the once fruitful province
into a desolate and smoking wilderness. But in the creed of Justinian,
the guilt of murder could not be applied to the slaughter of
unbelievers; and he piously labored to establish with fire and sword the
unity of the Christian faith. [91]

[Footnote 84: This alternative, a precious circumstance, is preserved
by John Malala, (tom. ii. p. 63, edit. Venet. 1733,) who deserves
more credit as he draws towards his end. After numbering the heretics,
Nestorians, Eutychians, &c., ne expectent, says Justinian, ut digni
venia judicen tur: jubemus, enim ut...convicti et aperti haeretici
justae et idoneae animadversioni subjiciantur. Baronius copies and
applauds this edict of the Code, (A.D. 527, No. 39, 40.)]

[Footnote 85: See the character and principles of the Montanists, in
Mosheim, Rebus Christ. ante Constantinum, p. 410--424.]

[Footnote 86: Theophan. Chron. p. 153. John, the Monophysite bishop of
Asia, is a more authentic witness of this transaction, in which he was
himself employed by the emperor, (Asseman. Bib. Orient. tom. ii. p.
85.)]

[Footnote 87: Compare Procopius (Hist. Arcan. c. 28, and Aleman's Notes)
with Theophanes, (Chron. p. 190.) The council of Nice has intrusted the
patriarch, or rather the astronomers, of Alexandria, with the annual
proclamation of Easter; and we still read, or rather we do not
read, many of the Paschal epistles of St. Cyril. Since the reign of
Monophytism in Egypt, the Catholics were perplexed by such a foolish
prejudice as that which so long opposed, among the Protestants, the
reception of the Gregorian style.]

[Footnote 88: For the religion and history of the Samaritans, consult
Basnage, Histoire des Juifs, a learned and impartial work.]

[Footnote 89: Sichem, Neapolis, Naplous, the ancient and modern seat
of the Samaritans, is situate in a valley between the barren Ebal, the
mountain of cursing to the north, and the fruitful Garizim, or mountain
of cursing to the south, ten or eleven hours' travel from Jerusalem. See
Maundrel, Journey from Aleppo &c.]

[Footnote 90: Procop. Anecdot. c. 11. Theophan. Chron. p. 122.
John Malala Chron. tom. ii. p. 62. I remember an observation, half
philosophical. half superstitious, that the province which had been
ruined by the bigotry of Justinian, was the same through which the
Mahometans penetrated into the empire.]

[Footnote 91: The expression of Procopius is remarkable. Anecdot. c.
13.]

With these sentiments, it was incumbent on him, at least, to be always
in the right. In the first years of his administration, he signalized
his zeal as the disciple and patron of orthodoxy: the reconciliation of
the Greeks and Latins established the tome of St. Leo as the creed of
the emperor and the empire; the Nestorians and Eutychians were exposed.
on either side, to the double edge of persecution; and the four synods
of Nice, Constantinople, Ephesus, and Chalcedon, were ratified by the
code of a Catholic lawgiver. [92] But while Justinian strove to maintain
the uniformity of faith and worship, his wife Theodora, whose vices
were not incompatible with devotion, had listened to the Monophysite
teachers; and the open or clandestine enemies of the church revived and
multiplied at the smile of their gracious patroness. The capital, the
palace, the nuptial bed, were torn by spiritual discord; yet so doubtful
was the sincerity of the royal consorts, that their seeming disagreement
was imputed by many to a secret and mischievous confederacy against the
religion and happiness of their people. [93] The famous dispute of the
Three Chapters, [94] which has filled more volumes than it deserves
lines, is deeply marked with this subtile and disingenuous spirit. It
was now three hundred years since the body of Origen [95] had been eaten
by the worms: his soul, of which he held the preexistence, was in the
hands of its Creator; but his writings were eagerly perused by the monks
of Palestine. In these writings, the piercing eye of Justinian descried
more than ten metaphysical errors; and the primitive doctor, in the
company of Pythagoras and Plato, was devoted by the clergy to the
eternity of hell-fire, which he had presumed to deny. Under the cover
of this precedent, a treacherous blow was aimed at the council of
Chalcedon. The fathers had listened without impatience to the praise
of Theodore of Mopsuestia; [96] and their justice or indulgence had
restored both Theodore of Cyrrhus, and Ibas of Edessa, to the communion
of the church. But the characters of these Oriental bishops were tainted
with the reproach of heresy; the first had been the master, the two
others were the friends, of Nestorius; their most suspicious passages
were accused under the title of the three chapters; and the condemnation
of their memory must involve the honor of a synod, whose name was
pronounced with sincere or affected reverence by the Catholic world. If
these bishops, whether innocent or guilty, were annihilated in the sleep
of death, they would not probably be awakened by the clamor which, after
the a hundred years, was raised over their grave. If they were already
in the fangs of the daemon, their torments could neither be aggravated
nor assuaged by human industry. If in the company of saints and angels
they enjoyed the rewards of piety, they must have smiled at the idle
fury of the theological insects who still crawled on the surface of the
earth. The foremost of these insects, the emperor of the Romans, darted
his sting, and distilled his venom, perhaps without discerning the true
motives of Theodora and her ecclesiastical faction. The victims were no
longer subject to his power, and the vehement style of his edicts could
only proclaim their damnation, and invite the clergy of the East to
join in a full chorus of curses and anathemas. The East, with some
hesitation, consented to the voice of her sovereign: the fifth general
council, of three patriarchs and one hundred and sixty-five bishops, was
held at Constantinople; and the authors, as well as the defenders, of
the three chapters were separated from the communion of the saints, and
solemnly delivered to the prince of darkness. But the Latin churches
were more jealous of the honor of Leo and the synod of Chalcedon: and
if they had fought as they usually did under the standard of Rome, they
might have prevailed in the cause of reason and humanity. But their
chief was a prisoner in the hands of the enemy; the throne of St. Peter,
which had been disgraced by the simony, was betrayed by the cowardice,
of Vigilius, who yielded, after a long and inconsistent struggle, to
the despotism of Justinian and the sophistry of the Greeks. His apostasy
provoked the indignation of the Latins, and no more than two bishops
could be found who would impose their hands on his deacon and successor
Pelagius. Yet the perseverance of the popes insensibly transferred to
their adversaries the appellation of schismatics; the Illyrian, African,
and Italian churches were oppressed by the civil and ecclesiastical
powers, not without some effort of military force; [97] the distant
Barbarians transcribed the creed of the Vatican, and, in the period of a
century, the schism of the three chapters expired in an obscure angle of
the Venetian province. [98] But the religious discontent of the Italians
had already promoted the conquests of the Lombards, and the Romans
themselves were accustomed to suspect the faith and to detest the
government of their Byzantine tyrant.

[Footnote 92: See the Chronicle of Victor, p. 328, and the original
evidence of the laws of Justinian. During the first years of his reign,
Baronius himself is in extreme good humor with the emperor, who courted
the popes, till he got them into his power.]

[Footnote 93: Procopius, Anecdot. c. 13. Evagrius, l. iv. c. 10. If the
ecclesiastical never read the secret historian, their common suspicion
proves at least the general hatred.]

[Footnote 94: On the subject of the three chapters, the original acts
of the vth general council of Constantinople supply much useless, though
authentic, knowledge, (Concil. tom. vi. p. 1-419.) The Greek Evagrius is
less copious and correct (l. iv. c. 38) than the three zealous Africans,
Facundus, (in his twelve books, de tribus capitulis, which are most
correctly published by Sirmond,) Liberatus, (in his Breviarium, c. 22,
23, 24,) and Victor Tunnunensis in his Chronicle, (in tom. i. Antiq.
Lect. Canisii, 330--334.) The Liber Pontificalis, or Anastasius, (in
Vigilio, Pelagio, &c.,) is original Italian evidence. The modern reader
will derive some information from Dupin (Bibliot. Eccles. tom. v. p.
189--207) and Basnage, (Hist. de l'Eglise, tom. i. p. 519--541;) yet the
latter is too firmly resolved to depreciate the authority and character
of the popes.]

[Footnote 95: Origen had indeed too great a propensity to imitate the
old philosophers, (Justinian, ad Mennam, in Concil. tom. vi. p. 356.)
His moderate opinions were too repugnant to the zeal of the church, and
he was found guilty of the heresy of reason.]

[Footnote 96: Basnage (Praefat. p. 11--14, ad tom. i. Antiq. Lect.
Canis.) has fairly weighed the guilt and innocence of Theodore of
Mopsuestia. If he composed 10,000 volumes, as many errors would be a
charitable allowance. In all the subsequent catalogues of heresiarchs,
he alone, without his two brethren, is included; and it is the duty
of Asseman (Bibliot. Orient. tom. iv. p. 203--207) to justify the
sentence.]

[Footnote 97: See the complaints of Liberatus and Victor, and the
exhortations of Pope Pelagius to the conqueror and exarch of Italy.
Schisma.. per potestates publicas opprimatur, &c., (Concil. tom. vi. p.
467, &c.) An army was detained to suppress the sedition of an Illyrian
city. See Procopius, (de Bell. Goth. l. iv. c. 25:). He seems to promise
an ecclesiastical history. It would have been curious and impartial.]

[Footnote 98: The bishops of the patriarchate of Aquileia were
reconciled by Pope Honorius, A.D. 638, (Muratori, Annali d' Italia,
tom. v. p. 376;) but they again relapsed, and the schism was not finally
extinguished till 698. Fourteen years before, the church of Spain had
overlooked the vth general council with contemptuous silence, (xiii.
Concil. Toretan. in Concil. tom. vii. p. 487--494.)]

Justinian was neither steady nor consistent in the nice process of
fixing his volatile opinions and those of his subjects. In his youth he
was, offended by the slightest deviation from the orthodox line; in
his old age he transgressed the measure of temperate heresy, and
the Jacobites, not less than the Catholics, were scandalized by his
declaration, that the body of Christ was incorruptible, and that his
manhood was never subject to any wants and infirmities, the inheritance
of our mortal flesh. This fantastic opinion was announced in the last
edicts of Justinian; and at the moment of his seasonable departure, the
clergy had refused to subscribe, the prince was prepared to persecute,
and the people were resolved to suffer or resist. A bishop of Treves,
secure beyond the limits of his power, addressed the monarch of the East
in the language of authority and affection. "Most gracious Justinian,
remember your baptism and your creed. Let not your gray hairs be defiled
with heresy. Recall your fathers from exile, and your followers from
perdition. You cannot be ignorant, that Italy and Gaul, Spain and
Africa, already deplore your fall, and anathematize your name. Unless,
without delay, you destroy what you have taught; unless you exclaim
with a loud voice, I have erred, I have sinned, anathema to Nestorius,
anathema to Eutyches, you deliver your soul to the same flames in which
they will eternally burn." He died and made no sign. [99] His death
restored in some degree the peace of the church, and the reigns of his
four successors, Justin Tiberius, Maurice, and Phocas, are distinguished
by a rare, though fortunate, vacancy in the ecclesiastical history of
the East. [100]

[Footnote 99: Nicetus, bishop of Treves, (Concil. tom. vi. p. 511-513:)
he himself, like most of the Gallican prelates, (Gregor. Epist. l. vii.
5 in Concil. tom. vi. p. 1007,) was separated from the communion of the
four patriarchs by his refusal to condemn the three chapters. Baronius
almost pronounces the damnation of Justinian, (A.D. 565, No. 6.)]

[Footnote 100: After relating the last heresy of Justinian, (l. iv. c.
39, 40, 41,) and the edict of his successor, (l. v. c. 3,) the
remainder of the history of Evagrius is filled with civil, instead of
ecclesiastical events.]

The faculties of sense and reason are least capable of acting on
themselves; the eye is most inaccessible to the sight, the soul to the
thought; yet we think, and even feel, that one will, a sole principle of
action, is essential to a rational and conscious being. When Heraclius
returned from the Persian war, the orthodox hero consulted his bishops,
whether the Christ whom he adored, of one person, but of two natures,
was actuated by a single or a double will. They replied in the singular,
and the emperor was encouraged to hope that the Jacobites of Egypt
and Syria might be reconciled by the profession of a doctrine, most
certainly harmless, and most probably true, since it was taught even
by the Nestorians themselves. [101] The experiment was tried without
effect, and the timid or vehement Catholics condemned even the semblance
of a retreat in the presence of a subtle and audacious enemy. The
orthodox (the prevailing) party devised new modes of speech, and
argument, and interpretation: to either nature of Christ they speciously
applied a proper and distinct energy; but the difference was no longer
visible when they allowed that the human and the divine will were
invariably the same. [102] The disease was attended with the customary
symptoms: but the Greek clergy, as if satiated with the endless
controversy of the incarnation, instilled a healing counsel into the
ear of the prince and people. They declared themselves Monothelites,
(asserters of the unity of will,) but they treated the words as new,
the questions as superfluous; and recommended a religious silence as the
most agreeable to the prudence and charity of the gospel. This law
of silence was successively imposed by the ecthesis or exposition of
Heraclius, the type or model of his grandson Constans; [103] and the
Imperial edicts were subscribed with alacrity or reluctance by the four
patriarchs of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, and Antioch. But the
bishop and monks of Jerusalem sounded the alarm: in the language, or
even in the silence, of the Greeks, the Latin churches detected a
latent heresy: and the obedience of Pope Honorius to the commands of
his sovereign was retracted and censured by the bolder ignorance of his
successors. They condemned the execrable and abominable heresy of the
Monothelites, who revived the errors of Manes, Apollinaris, Eutyches,
&c.; they signed the sentence of excommunication on the tomb of St.
Peter; the ink was mingled with the sacramental wine, the blood of
Christ; and no ceremony was omitted that could fill the superstitious
mind with horror and affright. As the representative of the Western
church, Pope Martin and his Lateran synod anathematized the perfidious
and guilty silence of the Greeks: one hundred and five bishops of Italy,
for the most part the subjects of Constans, presumed to reprobate
his wicked type, and the impious ecthesis of his grandfather; and to
confound the authors and their adherents with the twenty-one notorious
heretics, the apostates from the church, and the organs of the devil.
Such an insult under the tamest reign could not pass with impunity.
Pope Martin ended his days on the inhospitable shore of the Tauric
Chersonesus, and his oracle, the abbot Maximus, was inhumanly chastised
by the amputation of his tongue and his right hand. [104] But the same
invincible spirit survived in their successors; and the triumph of the
Latins avenged their recent defeat, and obliterated the disgrace of the
three chapters. The synods of Rome were confirmed by the sixth general
council of Constantinople, in the palace and the presence of a new
Constantine, a descendant of Heraclius. The royal convert converted the
Byzantine pontiff and a majority of the bishops; [105] the dissenters,
with their chief, Macarius of Antioch, were condemned to the spiritual
and temporal pains of heresy; the East condescended to accept the
lessons of the West; and the creed was finally settled, which teaches
the Catholics of every age, that two wills or energies are harmonized
in the person of Christ. The majesty of the pope and the Roman synod
was represented by two priests, one deacon, and three bishops; but these
obscure Latins had neither arms to compel, nor treasures to bribe,
nor language to persuade; and I am ignorant by what arts they could
determine the lofty emperor of the Greeks to abjure the catechism of his
infancy, and to persecute the religion of his fathers. Perhaps the monks
and people of Constantinople [106] were favorable to the Lateran creed,
which is indeed the least reasonable of the two: and the suspicion is
countenanced by the unnatural moderation of the Greek clergy, who appear
in this quarrel to be conscious of their weakness. While the synod
debated, a fanatic proposed a more summary decision, by raising a dead
man to life: the prelates assisted at the trial; but the acknowledged
failure may serve to indicate, that the passions and prejudices of the
multitude were not enlisted on the side of the Monothelites. In the next
generation, when the son of Constantine was deposed and slain by the
disciple of Macarius, they tasted the feast of revenge and dominion:
the image or monument of the sixth council was defaced, and the original
acts were committed to the flames. But in the second year, their patron
was cast headlong from the throne, the bishops of the East were released
from their occasional conformity, the Roman faith was more firmly
replanted by the orthodox successors of Bardanes, and the fine problems
of the incarnation were forgotten in the more popular and visible
quarrel of the worship of images. [107]

[Footnote 101: This extraordinary, and perhaps inconsistent, doctrine of
the Nestorians, had been observed by La Croze, (Christianisme des
Indes, tom. i. p. 19, 20,) and is more fully exposed by Abulpharagius,
(Bibliot. Orient. tom. ii. p. 292. Hist. Dynast. p. 91, vers. Latin.
Pocock.) and Asseman himself, (tom. iv. p. 218.) They seem ignorant that
they might allege the positive authority of the ecthesis. (the common
reproach of the Monophysites) (Concil. tom. vii. p. 205.)]

[Footnote 102: See the Orthodox faith in Petavius, (Dogmata Theolog.
tom. v. l. ix. c. 6--10, p. 433--447:) all the depths of this
controversy in the Greek dialogue between Maximus and Pyrrhus, (acalcem
tom. viii. Annal. Baron. p. 755--794,) which relates a real conference,
and produced as short-lived a conversion.]

[Footnote 103: Impiissimam ecthesim.... scelerosum typum (Concil. tom.
vii p. 366) diabolicae operationis genimina, (fors. germina, or else the
Greek in the original. Concil. p. 363, 364,) are the expressions of
the xviiith anathema. The epistle of Pope Martin to Amandus, Gallican
bishop, stigmatizes the Monothelites and their heresy with equal
virulence, (p. 392.)]

[Footnote 104: The sufferings of Martin and Maximus are described with
simplicity in their original letters and acts, (Concil. tom. vii. p.
63--78. Baron. Annal. Eccles. A.D. 656, No. 2, et annos subsequent.) Yet
the chastisement of their disobedience had been previously announced in
the Type of Constans, (Concil. tom. vii. p. 240.)]

[Footnote 105: Eutychius (Annal. tom. ii. p. 368) most erroneously
supposes that the 124 bishops of the Roman synod transported themselves
to Constantinople; and by adding them to the 168 Greeks, thus composes
the sixth council of 292 fathers.]

[Footnote 106: The Monothelite Constans was hated by all, (says
Theophanes, Chron. p. 292). When the Monothelite monk failed in his
miracle, the people shouted, (Concil. tom. vii. p. 1032.) But this was
a natural and transient emotion; and I much fear that the latter is an
anticipation of the good people of Constantinople.]

[Footnote 107: The history of Monothelitism may be found in the Acts of
the Synods of Rome (tom. vii. p. 77--395, 601--608) and Constantinople,
(p. 609--1429.) Baronius extracted some original documents from the
Vatican library; and his chronology is rectified by the diligence of
Pagi. Even Dupin (Bibliotheque Eccles. tom. vi. p. 57--71) and Basnage
(Hist. de l'Eglise, tom. i. p. 451--555) afford a tolerable abridgment.]

Before the end of the seventh century, the creed of the incarnation,
which had been defined at Rome and Constantinople, was uniformly
preached in the remote islands of Britain and Ireland; [108] the same
ideas were entertained, or rather the same words were repeated, by all
the Christians whose liturgy was performed in the Greek or the Latin
tongue. Their numbers, and visible splendor, bestowed an imperfect claim
to the appellation of Catholics: but in the East, they were marked with
the less honorable name of Melchites, or Royalists; [109] of men,
whose faith, instead of resting on the basis of Scripture, reason,
or tradition, had been established, and was still maintained, by the
arbitrary power of a temporal monarch. Their adversaries might allege
the words of the fathers of Constantinople, who profess themselves the
slaves of the king; and they might relate, with malicious joy, how
the decrees of Chalcedon had been inspired and reformed by the emperor
Marcian and his virgin bride. The prevailing faction will naturally
inculcate the duty of submission, nor is it less natural that dissenters
should feel and assert the principles of freedom. Under the rod of
persecution, the Nestorians and Monophysites degenerated into rebels and
fugitives; and the most ancient and useful allies of Rome were taught
to consider the emperor not as the chief, but as the enemy of the
Christians. Language, the leading principle which unites or separates
the tribes of mankind, soon discriminated the sectaries of the East, by
a peculiar and perpetual badge, which abolished the means of intercourse
and the hope of reconciliation. The long dominion of the Greeks, their
colonies, and, above all, their eloquence, had propagated a language
doubtless the most perfect that has been contrived by the art of man.
Yet the body of the people, both in Syria and Egypt, still persevered
in the use of their national idioms; with this difference, however, that
the Coptic was confined to the rude and illiterate peasants of the Nile,
while the Syriac, [110] from the mountains of Assyria to the Red Sea,
was adapted to the higher topics of poetry and argument. Armenia and
Abyssinia were infected by the speech or learning of the Greeks; and
their Barbaric tongues, which have been revived in the studies of modern
Europe, were unintelligible to the inhabitants of the Roman empire. The
Syriac and the Coptic, the Armenian and the Aethiopic, are consecrated
in the service of their respective churches: and their theology is
enriched by domestic versions [111] both of the Scriptures and of the
most popular fathers. After a period of thirteen hundred and sixty
years, the spark of controversy, first kindled by a sermon of Nestorius,
still burns in the bosom of the East, and the hostile communions still
maintain the faith and discipline of their founders. In the most
abject state of ignorance, poverty, and servitude, the Nestorians and
Monophysites reject the spiritual supremacy of Rome, and cherish the
toleration of their Turkish masters, which allows them to anathematize,
on the one hand, St. Cyril and the synod of Ephesus: on the other, Pope
Leo and the council of Chalcedon. The weight which they cast into the
downfall of the Eastern empire demands our notice, and the reader may
be amused with the various prospect of, I. The Nestorians; II. The
Jacobites; [112] III. The Maronites; IV. The Armenians; V. The Copts;
and, VI. The Abyssinians. To the three former, the Syriac is common; but
of the latter, each is discriminated by the use of a national idiom.

Yet the modern natives of Armenia and Abyssinia would be incapable of
conversing with their ancestors; and the Christians of Egypt and Syria,
who reject the religion, have adopted the language of the Arabians. The
lapse of time has seconded the sacerdotal arts; and in the East, as well
as in the West, the Deity is addressed in an obsolete tongue, unknown to
the majority of the congregation.

[Footnote 108: In the Lateran synod of 679, Wilfred, an Anglo-Saxon
bishop, subscribed pro omni Aquilonari parte Britanniae et Hiberniae,
quae ab Anglorum et Britonum, necnon Scotorum et Pictorum gentibus
colebantur, (Eddius, in Vit. St. Wilfrid. c. 31, apud Pagi, Critica,
tom. iii. p. 88.) Theodore (magnae insulae Britanniae archiepiscopus et
philosophus) was long expected at Rome, (Concil. tom. vii. p. 714,) but
he contented himself with holding (A.D. 680) his provincial synod of
Hatfield, in which he received the decrees of Pope Martin and the first
Lateran council against the Monothelites, (Concil. tom. vii. p. 597,
&c.) Theodore, a monk of Tarsus in Cilicia, had been named to the
primacy of Britain by Pope Vitalian, (A.D. 688; see Baronius and Pagi,)
whose esteem for his learning and piety was tainted by some distrust
of his national character--ne quid contrarium veritati fidei, Graecorum
more, in ecclesiam cui praeesset introduceret. The Cilician was sent
from Rome to Canterbury under the tuition of an African guide, (Bedae
Hist. Eccles. Anglorum. l. iv. c. 1.) He adhered to the Roman doctrine;
and the same creed of the incarnation has been uniformly transmitted
from Theodore to the modern primates, whose sound understanding is
perhaps seldom engaged with that abstruse mystery.]

[Footnote 109: This name, unknown till the xth century, appears to be of
Syriac origin. It was invented by the Jacobites, and eagerly adopted by
the Nestorians and Mahometans; but it was accepted without shame by the
Catholics, and is frequently used in the Annals of Eutychius, (Asseman.
Bibliot. Orient. tom. ii. p. 507, &c., tom. iii. p. 355. Renaudot, Hist.
Patriarch. Alexandrin. p. 119.), was the acclamation of the fathers of
Constantinople, (Concil. tom. vii. p. 765.)]

[Footnote 110: The Syriac, which the natives revere as the primitive
language, was divided into three dialects. 1. The Aramoean, as it was
refined at Edessa and the cities of Mesopotamia. 2. The Palestine,
which was used in Jerusalem, Damascus, and the rest of Syria. 3.
The Nabathoean, the rustic idiom of the mountains of Assyria and the
villages of Irak, (Gregor, Abulpharag. Hist. Dynast. p. 11.) On the
Syriac, sea Ebed-Jesu, (Asseman. tom. iii. p. 326, &c.,) whose prejudice
alone could prefer it to the Arabic.]

[Footnote 111: I shall not enrich my ignorance with the spoils of Simon,
Walton, Mill, Wetstein, Assemannus, Ludolphus, La Croze, whom I have
consulted with some care. It appears, 1. That, of all the versions which
are celebrated by the fathers, it is doubtful whether any are now extant
in their pristine integrity. 2. That the Syriac has the best claim,
and that the consent of the Oriental sects is a proof that it is more
ancient than their schism.]

[Footnote 112: In the account of the Monophysites and Nestorians, I am
deeply indebted to the Bibliotheca Orientalis Clementino-Vaticana of
Joseph Simon Assemannus. That learned Maronite was despatched, in the
year 1715, by Pope Clement XI. to visit the monasteries of Egypt and
Syria, in search of Mss. His four folio volumes, published at Rome
1719--1728, contain a part only, though perhaps the most valuable, of
his extensive project. As a native and as a scholar, he possessed the
Syriac literature; and though a dependent of Rome, he wishes to be
moderate and candid.]
