## Chapter XLII: State Of The Barbaric World.--Part II.

In the rapid career of conquest, the Turks attacked and subdued the
nation of the Ogors or Varchonites [3011] on the banks of the River
Til, which derived the epithet of Black from its dark water or gloomy
forests. [31] The khan of the Ogors was slain with three hundred
thousand of his subjects, and their bodies were scattered over the
space of four days' journey: their surviving countrymen acknowledged
the strength and mercy of the Turks; and a small portion, about twenty
thousand warriors, preferred exile to servitude. They followed the
well-known road of the Volga, cherished the error of the nations who
confounded them with the Avars, and spread the terror of that false
though famous appellation, which had not, however, saved its lawful
proprietors from the yoke of the Turks. [32] After a long and victorious
march, the new Avars arrived at the foot of Mount Caucasus, in the
country of the Alani [33] and Circassians, where they first heard of the
splendor and weakness of the Roman empire. They humbly requested their
confederate, the prince of the Alani, to lead them to this source of
riches; and their ambassador, with the permission of the governor of
Lazica, was transported by the Euxine Sea to Constantinople. The whole
city was poured forth to behold with curiosity and terror the aspect
of a strange people: their long hair, which hung in tresses down their
backs, was gracefully bound with ribbons, but the rest of their habit
appeared to imitate the fashion of the Huns. When they were admitted
to the audience of Justinian, Candish, the first of the ambassadors,
addressed the Roman emperor in these terms: "You see before you, O
mighty prince, the representatives of the strongest and most populous
of nations, the invincible, the irresistible Avars. We are willing to
devote ourselves to your service: we are able to vanquish and destroy
all the enemies who now disturb your repose. But we expect, as the price
of our alliance, as the reward of our valor, precious gifts, annual
subsidies, and fruitful possessions." At the time of this embassy,
Justinian had reigned above thirty, he had lived above seventy-five
years: his mind, as well as his body, was feeble and languid; and the
conqueror of Africa and Italy, careless of the permanent interest of
his people, aspired only to end his days in the bosom even of inglorious
peace. In a studied oration, he imparted to the senate his resolution to
dissemble the insult, and to purchase the friendship of the Avars;
and the whole senate, like the mandarins of China, applauded the
incomparable wisdom and foresight of their sovereign. The instruments
of luxury were immediately prepared to captivate the Barbarians; silken
garments, soft and splendid beds, and chains and collars incrusted with
gold. The ambassadors, content with such liberal reception, departed
from Constantinople, and Valentin, one of the emperor's guards, was sent
with a similar character to their camp at the foot of Mount Caucasus.
As their destruction or their success must be alike advantageous to the
empire, he persuaded them to invade the enemies of Rome; and they
were easily tempted, by gifts and promises, to gratify their ruling
inclinations. These fugitives, who fled before the Turkish arms, passed
the Tanais and Borysthenes, and boldly advanced into the heart of Poland
and Germany, violating the law of nations, and abusing the rights of
victory. Before ten years had elapsed, their camps were seated on
the Danube and the Elbe, many Bulgarian and Sclavonian names were
obliterated from the earth, and the remainder of their tribes are found,
as tributaries and vassals, under the standard of the Avars. The chagan,
the peculiar title of their king, still affected to cultivate the
friendship of the emperor; and Justinian entertained some thoughts
of fixing them in Pannonia, to balance the prevailing power of the
Lombards. But the virtue or treachery of an Avar betrayed the secret
enmity and ambitious designs of their countrymen; and they loudly
complained of the timid, though jealous policy, of detaining their
ambassadors, and denying the arms which they had been allowed to
purchase in the capital of the empire. [34]

[Footnote 3011: The Ogors or Varchonites, from Var. a river, (obviously
connected with the name Avar,) must not be confounded with the Uigours,
the eastern Turks, (v. Hammer, Osmanische Geschichte, vol. i. p. 3,) who
speak a language the parent of the more modern Turkish dialects. Compare
Klaproth, page 121. They are the ancestors of the Usbeck Turks. These
Ogors were of the same Finnish race with the Huns; and the 20,000
families which fled towards the west, after the Turkish invasion, were
of the same race with those which remained to the east of the Volga, the
true Avars of Theophy fact.--M.]

[Footnote 31: The River Til, or Tula, according to the geography of
De Guignes, (tom. i. part ii. p. lviii. and 352,) is a small, though
grateful, stream of the desert, that falls into the Orhon, Selinga, &c.
See Bell, Journey from Petersburg to Pekin, (vol. ii. p. 124;) yet
his own description of the Keat, down which he sailed into the Oby,
represents the name and attributes of the black river, (p. 139.) * Note:
M. Klaproth, (Tableaux Historiques de l'Asie, p. 274) supposes this
river to be an eastern affluent of the Volga, the Kama, which, from the
color of its waters, might be called black. M. Abel Remusat (Recherchea
sur les Langues Tartares, vol. i. p. 320) and M. St. Martin (vol. ix.
p. 373) consider it the Volga, which is called Atel or Etel by all the
Turkish tribes. It is called Attilas by Menander, and Ettilia by the
monk Ruysbreek (1253.) See Klaproth, Tabl. Hist. p. 247. This geography
is much more clear and simple than that adopted by Gibbon from De
Guignes, or suggested from Bell.--M.]

[Footnote 32: Theophylact, l. vii. c. 7, 8. And yet his true Avars
are invisible even to the eyes of M. de Guignes; and what can be more
illustrious than the false? The right of the fugitive Ogors to that
national appellation is confessed by the Turks themselves, (Menander, p.
108.)]

[Footnote 33: The Alani are still found in the Genealogical History of
the Tartars, (p. 617,) and in D'Anville's maps. They opposed the march
of the generals of Zingis round the Caspian Sea, and were overthrown in
a great battle, (Hist. de Gengiscan, l. iv. c. 9, p. 447.)]

[Footnote 34: The embassies and first conquests of the Avars may be read
in Menander, (Excerpt. Legat. p. 99, 100, 101, 154, 155,) Theophanes,
(p. 196,) the Historia Miscella, (l. xvi. p. 109,) and Gregory of Tours,
(L iv. c. 23, 29, in the Historians of France, tom. ii. p. 214, 217.)]

Perhaps the apparent change in the dispositions of the emperors may be
ascribed to the embassy which was received from the conquerors of the
Avars. [35] The immense distance which eluded their arms could not
extinguish their resentment: the Turkish ambassadors pursued the
footsteps of the vanquished to the Jaik, the Volga, Mount Caucasus, the
Euxine and Constantinople, and at length appeared before the successor
of Constantine, to request that he would not espouse the cause of
rebels and fugitives. Even commerce had some share in this remarkable
negotiation: and the Sogdoites, who were now the tributaries of the
Turks, embraced the fair occasion of opening, by the north of the
Caspian, a new road for the importation of Chinese silk into the Roman
empire. The Persian, who preferred the navigation of Ceylon, had stopped
the caravans of Bochara and Samarcand: their silk was contemptuously
burnt: some Turkish ambassadors died in Persia, with a suspicion of
poison; and the great khan permitted his faithful vassal Maniach, the
prince of the Sogdoites, to propose, at the Byzantine court, a treaty of
alliance against their common enemies. Their splendid apparel and rich
presents, the fruit of Oriental luxury, distinguished Maniach and his
colleagues from the rude savages of the North: their letters, in the
Scythian character and language, announced a people who had attained the
rudiments of science: [36] they enumerated the conquests, they offered
the friendship and military aid of the Turks; and their sincerity was
attested by direful imprecations (if they were guilty of falsehood)
against their own head, and the head of Disabul their master. The Greek
prince entertained with hospitable regard the ambassadors of a remote
and powerful monarch: the sight of silk-worms and looms disappointed the
hopes of the Sogdoites; the emperor renounced, or seemed to renounce,
the fugitive Avars, but he accepted the alliance of the Turks; and the
ratification of the treaty was carried by a Roman minister to the foot
of Mount Altai. Under the successors of Justinian, the friendship of the
two nations was cultivated by frequent and cordial intercourse; the most
favored vassals were permitted to imitate the example of the great khan,
and one hundred and six Turks, who, on various occasions, had visited
Constantinople, departed at the same time for their native country. The
duration and length of the journey from the Byzantine court to Mount
Altai are not specified: it might have been difficult to mark a road
through the nameless deserts, the mountains, rivers, and morasses of
Tartary; but a curious account has been preserved of the reception of
the Roman ambassadors at the royal camp. After they had been purified
with fire and incense, according to a rite still practised under the
sons of Zingis, [3611] they were introduced to the presence of Disabul.
In a valley of the Golden Mountain, they found the great khan in
his tent, seated in a chair with wheels, to which a horse might be
occasionally harnessed. As soon as they had delivered their presents,
which were received by the proper officers, they exposed, in a florid
oration, the wishes of the Roman emperor, that victory might attend the
arms of the Turks, that their reign might be long and prosperous,
and that a strict alliance, without envy or deceit, might forever be
maintained between the two most powerful nations of the earth. The
answer of Disabul corresponded with these friendly professions, and
the ambassadors were seated by his side, at a banquet which lasted the
greatest part of the day: the tent was surrounded with silk hangings,
and a Tartar liquor was served on the table, which possessed at least
the intoxicating qualities of wine. The entertainment of the succeeding
day was more sumptuous; the silk hangings of the second tent were
embroidered in various figures; and the royal seat, the cups, and the
vases, were of gold. A third pavilion was supported by columns of gilt
wood; a bed of pure and massy gold was raised on four peacocks of the
same metal: and before the entrance of the tent, dishes, basins, and
statues of solid silver, and admirable art, were ostentatiously piled in
wagons, the monuments of valor rather than of industry. When Disabul led
his armies against the frontiers of Persia, his Roman allies followed
many days the march of the Turkish camp, nor were they dismissed till
they had enjoyed their precedency over the envoy of the great king,
whose loud and intemperate clamors interrupted the silence of the royal
banquet. The power and ambition of Chosroes cemented the union of the
Turks and Romans, who touched his dominions on either side: but those
distant nations, regardless of each other, consulted the dictates of
interest, without recollecting the obligations of oaths and treaties.
While the successor of Disabul celebrated his father's obsequies, he
was saluted by the ambassadors of the emperor Tiberius, who proposed an
invasion of Persia, and sustained, with firmness, the angry and perhaps
the just reproaches of that haughty Barbarian. "You see my ten fingers,"
said the great khan, and he applied them to his mouth. "You Romans speak
with as many tongues, but they are tongues of deceit and perjury. To
me you hold one language, to my subjects another; and the nations are
successively deluded by your perfidious eloquence. You precipitate your
allies into war and danger, you enjoy their labors, and you neglect
your benefactors. Hasten your return, inform your master that a Turk is
incapable of uttering or forgiving falsehood, and that he shall speedily
meet the punishment which he deserves. While he solicits my friendship
with flattering and hollow words, he is sunk to a confederate of
my fugitive Varchonites. If I condescend to march against those
contemptible slaves, they will tremble at the sound of our whips; they
will be trampled, like a nest of ants, under the feet of my innumerable
cavalry. I am not ignorant of the road which they have followed to
invade your empire; nor can I be deceived by the vain pretence, that
Mount Caucasus is the impregnable barrier of the Romans. I know the
course of the Niester, the Danube, and the Hebrus; the most warlike
nations have yielded to the arms of the Turks; and from the rising to
the setting sun, the earth is my inheritance." Notwithstanding this
menace, a sense of mutual advantage soon renewed the alliance of
the Turks and Romans: but the pride of the great khan survived his
resentment; and when he announced an important conquest to his friend
the emperor Maurice, he styled himself the master of the seven races,
and the lord of the seven climates of the world. [37]

[Footnote 35: Theophanes, (Chron. p. 204,) and the Hist. Miscella, (l.
xvi. p. 110,) as understood by De Guignes, (tom. i. part ii. p. 354,)
appear to speak of a Turkish embassy to Justinian himself; but that of
Maniach, in the fourth year of his successor Justin, is positively the
first that reached Constantinople, (Menander p. 108.)]

[Footnote 36: The Russians have found characters, rude hieroglyphics, on
the Irtish and Yenisei, on medals, tombs, idols, rocks, obelisks, &c.,
(Strahlenberg, Hist. of Siberia, p. 324, 346, 406, 429.) Dr. Hyde (de
Religione Veterum Persarum, p. 521, &c.) has given two alphabets of
Thibet and of the Eygours. I have long harbored a suspicion, that all
the Scythian, and some, perhaps much, of the Indian science, was
derived from the Greeks of Bactriana. * Note: Modern discoveries give no
confirmation to this suspicion. The character of Indian science, as
well as of their literature and mythology, indicates an original source.
Grecian art may have occasionally found its way into India. One or two
of the sculptures in Col. Tod's account of the Jain temples, if correct,
show a finer outline, and purer sense of beauty, than appears native to
India, where the monstrous always predominated over simple nature.--M.]

[Footnote 3611: This rite is so curious, that I have subjoined the
description of it:-- When these (the exorcisers, the Shamans) approached
Zemarchus, they took all our baggage and placed it in the centre. Then,
kindling a fire with branches of frankincense, lowly murmuring certain
barbarous words in the Scythian language, beating on a kind of bell
(a gong) and a drum, they passed over the baggage the leaves of the
frankincense, crackling with the fire, and at the same time themselves
becoming frantic, and violently leaping about, seemed to exorcise the
evil spirits. Having thus as they thought, averted all evil, they led
Zemarchus himself through the fire. Menander, in Niebuhr's Bryant. Hist.
p. 381. Compare Carpini's Travels. The princes of the race of Zingis
Khan condescended to receive the ambassadors of the king of France, at
the end of the 13th century without their submitting to this humiliating
rite. See Correspondence published by Abel Remusat, Nouv. Mem. de l'Acad
des Inscrip. vol. vii. On the embassy of Zemarchus, compare Klaproth,
Tableaux de l'Asie p. 116.--M.]

[Footnote 37: All the details of these Turkish and Roman embassies, so
curious in the history of human manners, are drawn from the extracts of
Menander, (p. 106--110, 151--154, 161-164,) in which we often regret the
want of order and connection.]

Disputes have often arisen between the sovereigns of Asia for the title
of king of the world; while the contest has proved that it could not
belong to either of the competitors. The kingdom of the Turks was
bounded by the Oxus or Gihon; and Touran was separated by that great
river from the rival monarchy of Iran, or Persia, which in a smaller
compass contained perhaps a larger measure of power and population. The
Persians, who alternately invaded and repulsed the Turks and the Romans,
were still ruled by the house of Sassan, which ascended the throne
three hundred years before the accession of Justinian. His contemporary,
Cabades, or Kobad, had been successful in war against the emperor
Anastasius; but the reign of that prince was distracted by civil and
religious troubles. A prisoner in the hands of his subjects, an exile
among the enemies of Persia, he recovered his liberty by prostituting
the honor of his wife, and regained his kingdom with the dangerous and
mercenary aid of the Barbarians, who had slain his father. His nobles
were suspicious that Kobad never forgave the authors of his expulsion,
or even those of his restoration. The people was deluded and inflamed by
the fanaticism of Mazdak, [38] who asserted the community of women, [39]
and the equality of mankind, whilst he appropriated the richest lands
and most beautiful females to the use of his sectaries. The view of
these disorders, which had been fomented by his laws and example, [40]
imbittered the declining age of the Persian monarch; and his fears were
increased by the consciousness of his design to reverse the natural and
customary order of succession, in favor of his third and most favored
son, so famous under the names of Chosroes and Nushirvan. To render the
youth more illustrious in the eyes of the nations, Kobad was desirous
that he should be adopted by the emperor Justin: [4011] the hope of
peace inclined the Byzantine court to accept this singular proposal; and
Chosroes might have acquired a specious claim to the inheritance of his
Roman parent. But the future mischief was diverted by the advice of the
quaestor Proclus: a difficulty was started, whether the adoption should
be performed as a civil or military rite; [41] the treaty was abruptly
dissolved; and the sense of this indignity sunk deep into the mind
of Chosroes, who had already advanced to the Tigris on his road to
Constantinople. His father did not long survive the disappointment of
his wishes: the testament of their deceased sovereign was read in the
assembly of the nobles; and a powerful faction, prepared for the event,
and regardless of the priority of age, exalted Chosroes to the throne of
Persia. He filled that throne during a prosperous period of forty-eight
years; [42] and the Justice of Nushirvan is celebrated as the theme of
immortal praise by the nations of the East.

[Footnote 38: See D'Herbelot, (Bibliot. Orient. p. 568, 929;) Hyde, (de
Religione Vet. Persarum, c. 21, p. 290, 291;) Pocock, (Specimen Hist.
Arab. p. 70, 71;) Eutychius, (Annal. tom. ii. p. 176;) Texeira,
(in Stevens, Hist. of Persia, l. i. c. 34.) * Note: Mazdak was an
Archimagus, born, according to Mirkhond, (translated by De Sacy, p. 353,
and Malcolm, vol. i. p. 104,) at Istakhar or Persepolis, according to
an inedited and anonymous history, (the Modjmal-alte-warikh in the Royal
Library at Paris, quoted by St. Martin, vol. vii. p. 322) at Wischapour
in Chorasan: his father's name was Bamdadam. He announces himself as
a reformer of Zoroastrianism, and carried the doctrine of the
two principles to a much grater height. He preached the absolute
indifference of human action, perfect equality of rank, community
of property and of women, marriages between the nearest kindred; he
interdicted the use of animal food, proscribed the killing of animals
for food, enforced a vegetable diet. See St. Martin, vol. vii. p.
322. Malcolm, vol. i. p. 104. Mirkhond translated by De Sacy. It
is remarkable that the doctrine of Mazdak spread into the West. Two
inscriptions found in Cyrene, in 1823, and explained by M. Gesenius,
and by M. Hamaker of Leyden, prove clearly that his doctrines had been
eagerly embraced by the remains of the ancient Gnostics; and Mazdak was
enrolled with Thoth, Saturn, Zoroaster, Pythagoras, Epicurus, John, and
Christ, as the teachers of true Gnostic wisdom. See St. Martin, vol.
vii. p. 338. Gesenius de Inscriptione Phoenicio-Graeca in Cyrenaica
nuper reperta, Halle, 1825. Hamaker, Lettre a M. Raoul Rochette, Leyden,
1825.--M.]

[Footnote 39: The fame of the new law for the community of women was
soon propagated in Syria (Asseman. Bibliot. Orient. tom. iii. p. 402)
and Greece, (Procop. Persic. l. i. c. 5.)]

[Footnote 40: He offered his own wife and sister to the prophet; but the
prayers of Nushirvan saved his mother, and the indignant monarch never
forgave the humiliation to which his filial piety had stooped: pedes
tuos deosculatus (said he to Mazdak,) cujus foetor adhuc nares occupat,
(Pocock, Specimen Hist. Arab. p. 71.)]

[Footnote 4011: St. Martin questions this adoption: he urges its
improbability; and supposes that Procopius, perverting some popular
traditions, or the remembrance of some fruitless negotiations which took
place at that time, has mistaken, for a treaty of adoption some treaty
of guaranty or protection for the purpose of insuring the crown, after
the death of Kobad, to his favorite son Chosroes, vol. viii. p. 32. Yet
the Greek historians seem unanimous as to the proposal: the Persians
might be expected to maintain silence on such a subject.--M.]

[Footnote 41: Procopius, Persic. l. i. c. 11. Was not Proclus over-wise?
Was not the danger imaginary?--The excuse, at least, was injurious to
a nation not ignorant of letters. Whether any mode of adoption was
practised in Persia, I much doubt.]

[Footnote 42: From Procopius and Agathias, Pagi (tom. ii. p. 543, 626)
has proved that Chosroes Nushirvan ascended the throne in the fifth
year of Justinian, (A.D. 531, April 1.--A.D. 532, April 1.) But the
true chronology, which harmonizes with the Greeks and Orientals, is
ascertained by John Malala, (tom. ii. 211.) Cabades, or Kobad, after a
reign of forty-three years and two months, sickened the 8th, and died
the 13th of September, A.D. 531, aged eighty-two years. According to the
annals of Eutychius, Nushirvan reigned forty seven years and six months;
and his death must consequently be placed in March, A.D. 579.]

But the justice of kings is understood by themselves, and even by their
subjects, with an ample indulgence for the gratification of passion and
interest. The virtue of Chosroes was that of a conqueror, who, in the
measures of peace and war, is excited by ambition, and restrained by
prudence; who confounds the greatness with the happiness of a nation,
and calmly devotes the lives of thousands to the fame, or even the
amusement, of a single man. In his domestic administration, the just
Nushirvan would merit in our feelings the appellation of a tyrant. His
two elder brothers had been deprived of their fair expectations of the
diadem: their future life, between the supreme rank and the condition of
subjects, was anxious to themselves and formidable to their master: fear
as well as revenge might tempt them to rebel: the slightest evidence
of a conspiracy satisfied the author of their wrongs; and the repose of
Chosroes was secured by the death of these unhappy princes, with their
families and adherents. One guiltless youth was saved and dismissed by
the compassion of a veteran general; and this act of humanity, which was
revealed by his son, overbalanced the merit of reducing twelve nations
to the obedience of Persia. The zeal and prudence of Mebodes had fixed
the diadem on the head of Chosroes himself; but he delayed to attend the
royal summons, till he had performed the duties of a military review: he
was instantly commanded to repair to the iron tripod, which stood before
the gate of the palace, [43] where it was death to relieve or approach
the victim; and Mebodes languished several days before his sentence was
pronounced, by the inflexible pride and calm ingratitude of the son
of Kobad. But the people, more especially in the East, is disposed to
forgive, and even to applaud, the cruelty which strikes at the loftiest
heads; at the slaves of ambition, whose voluntary choice has exposed
them to live in the smiles, and to perish by the frown, of a capricious
monarch. In the execution of the laws which he had no temptation to
violate; in the punishment of crimes which attacked his own dignity, as
well as the happiness of individuals; Nushirvan, or Chosroes, deserved
the appellation of just. His government was firm, rigorous, and
impartial. It was the first labor of his reign to abolish the dangerous
theory of common or equal possessions: the lands and women which the
sectaries of Mazdak has usurped were restored to their lawful owners;
and the temperate [4311] chastisement of the fanatics or impostors
confirmed the domestic rights of society. Instead of listening with
blind confidence to a favorite minister, he established four viziers
over the four great provinces of his empire, Assyria, Media, Persia,
and Bactriana. In the choice of judges, praefects, and counsellors, he
strove to remove the mask which is always worn in the presence of kings:
he wished to substitute the natural order of talents for the accidental
distinctions of birth and fortune; he professed, in specious language,
his intention to prefer those men who carried the poor in their bosoms,
and to banish corruption from the seat of justice, as dogs were excluded
from the temples of the Magi. The code of laws of the first Artaxerxes
was revived and published as the rule of the magistrates; but the
assurance of speedy punishment was the best security of their virtue.
Their behavior was inspected by a thousand eyes, their words were
overheard by a thousand ears, the secret or public agents of the
throne; and the provinces, from the Indian to the Arabian confines,
were enlightened by the frequent visits of a sovereign, who affected
to emulate his celestial brother in his rapid and salutary career.
Education and agriculture he viewed as the two objects most deserving of
his care. In every city of Persia orphans, and the children of the poor,
were maintained and instructed at the public expense; the daughters were
given in marriage to the richest citizens of their own rank, and the
sons, according to their different talents, were employed in mechanic
trades, or promoted to more honorable service. The deserted villages
were relieved by his bounty; to the peasants and farmers who were found
incapable of cultivating their lands, he distributed cattle, seed, and
the instruments of husbandry; and the rare and inestimable treasure of
fresh water was parsimoniously managed, and skilfully dispersed over the
arid territory of Persia. [44] The prosperity of that kingdom was the
effect and evidence of his virtues; his vices are those of Oriental
despotism; but in the long competition between Chosroes and Justinian,
the advantage both of merit and fortune is almost always on the side of
the Barbarian. [45]

[Footnote 43: Procopius, Persic. l. i. c. 23. Brisson, de Regn. Pers.
p. 494. The gate of the palace of Ispahan is, or was, the fatal scene of
disgrace or death, (Chardin, Voyage en Perse, tom. iv. p. 312, 313.)]

[Footnote 4311: This is a strange term. Nushirvan employed a stratagem
similar to that of Jehu, 2 Kings, x. 18--28, to separate the followers
of Mazdak from the rest of his subjects, and with a body of his troops
cut them all in pieces. The Greek writers concur with the Persian in
this representation of Nushirvan's temperate conduct. Theophanes, p.
146. Mirkhond. p. 362. Eutychius, Ann. vol. ii. p. 179. Abulfeda, in an
unedited part, consulted by St. Martin as well as in a passage formerly
cited. Le Beau vol. viii. p. 38. Malcolm vol l p. 109.--M.]

[Footnote 44: In Persia, the prince of the waters is an officer
of state. The number of wells and subterraneous channels is much
diminished, and with it the fertility of the soil: 400 wells have been
recently lost near Tauris, and 42,000 were once reckoned in the province
of Khorasan (Chardin, tom. iii. p. 99, 100. Tavernier, tom. i. p. 416.)]

[Footnote 45: The character and government of Nushirvan is represented
some times in the words of D'Herbelot, (Bibliot. Orient. p. 680, &c.,
from Khondemir,) Eutychius, (Annal. tom. ii. p. 179, 180,--very rich,)
Abulpharagius, (Dynast. vii. p. 94, 95,--very poor,) Tarikh Schikard,
(p. 144--150,) Texeira, (in Stevens, l. i. c. 35,) Asseman, (Bibliot
Orient. tom. iii. p. 404-410,) and the Abbe Fourmont, (Hist. de l'Acad.
des Inscriptions, tom. vii. p. 325--334,) who has translated a spurious
or genuine testament of Nushirvan.]

To the praise of justice Nushirvan united the reputation of knowledge;
and the seven Greek philosophers, who visited his court, were invited
and deceived by the strange assurance, that a disciple of Plato
was seated on the Persian throne. Did they expect, that a prince,
strenuously exercised in the toils of war and government, should
agitate, with dexterity like their own, the abstruse and profound
questions which amused the leisure of the schools of Athens? Could they
hope that the precepts of philosophy should direct the life, and control
the passions, of a despot, whose infancy had been taught to consider his
absolute and fluctuating will as the only rule of moral obligation?
[46] The studies of Chosroes were ostentatious and superficial: but his
example awakened the curiosity of an ingenious people, and the light of
science was diffused over the dominions of Persia. [47] At Gondi Sapor,
in the neighborhood of the royal city of Susa, an academy of physic was
founded, which insensibly became a liberal school of poetry, philosophy,
and rhetoric. [48] The annals of the monarchy [49] were composed; and
while recent and authentic history might afford some useful lessons both
to the prince and people, the darkness of the first ages was embellished
by the giants, the dragons, and the fabulous heroes of Oriental romance.
[50] Every learned or confident stranger was enriched by the bounty, and
flattered by the conversation, of the monarch: he nobly rewarded a Greek
physician, [51] by the deliverance of three thousand, captives; and the
sophists, who contended for his favor, were exasperated by the wealth
and insolence of Uranius, their more successful rival. Nushirvan
believed, or at least respected, the religion of the Magi; and some
traces of persecution may be discovered in his reign. [52] Yet he
allowed himself freely to compare the tenets of the various sects; and
the theological disputes, in which he frequently presided, diminished
the authority of the priest, and enlightened the minds of the people.
At his command, the most celebrated writers of Greece and India were
translated into the Persian language; a smooth and elegant idiom,
recommended by Mahomet to the use of paradise; though it is branded with
the epithets of savage and unmusical, by the ignorance and presumption
of Agathias. [53] Yet the Greek historian might reasonably wonder that
it should be found possible to execute an entire version of Plato and
Aristotle in a foreign dialect, which had not been framed to express the
spirit of freedom and the subtilties of philosophic disquisition.
And, if the reason of the Stagyrite might be equally dark, or equally
intelligible in every tongue, the dramatic art and verbal argumentation
of the disciple of Socrates, [54] appear to be indissolubly mingled with
the grace and perfection of his Attic style. In the search of universal
knowledge, Nushirvan was informed, that the moral and political fables
of Pilpay, an ancient Brachman, were preserved with jealous reverence
among the treasures of the kings of India. The physician Perozes was
secretly despatched to the banks of the Ganges, with instructions to
procure, at any price, the communication of this valuable work. His
dexterity obtained a transcript, his learned diligence accomplished the
translation; and the fables of Pilpay [55] were read and admired in
the assembly of Nushirvan and his nobles. The Indian original, and the
Persian copy, have long since disappeared; but this venerable monument
has been saved by the curiosity of the Arabian caliphs, revived in
the modern Persic, the Turkish, the Syriac, the Hebrew, and the Greek
idioms, and transfused through successive versions into the modern
languages of Europe. In their present form, the peculiar character, the
manners and religion of the Hindoos, are completely obliterated; and the
intrinsic merit of the fables of Pilpay is far inferior to the concise
elegance of Phaedrus, and the native graces of La Fontaine. Fifteen
moral and political sentences are illustrated in a series of apologues:
but the composition is intricate, the narrative prolix, and the precept
obvious and barren. Yet the Brachman may assume the merit of inventing
a pleasing fiction, which adorns the nakedness of truth, and alleviates,
perhaps, to a royal ear, the harshness of instruction. With a similar
design, to admonish kings that they are strong only in the strength of
their subjects, the same Indians invented the game of chess, which was
likewise introduced into Persia under the reign of Nushirvan. [56]

[Footnote 46: A thousand years before his birth, the judges of Persia
had given a solemn opinion, (Herodot. l. iii. c. 31, p. 210, edit.
Wesseling.) Nor had this constitutional maxim been neglected as a
useless and barren theory.]

[Footnote 47: On the literary state of Persia, the Greek versions,
philosophers, sophists, the learning or ignorance of Chosroes, Agathias
(l. ii. c. 66--71) displays much information and strong prejudices.]

[Footnote 49: The Shah Nameh, or Book of Kings, is perhaps the original
record of history which was translated into Greek by the interpreter
Sergius, (Agathias, l. v. p. 141,) preserved after the Mahometan
conquest, and versified in the year 994, by the national poet Ferdoussi.
See D'Anquetil (Mem. de l'Academie, tom. xxxi. p. 379) and Sir William
Jones, (Hist. of Nadir Shah, p. 161.)]

[Footnote 50: In the fifth century, the name of Restom, or Rostam, a
hero who equalled the strength of twelve elephants, was familiar to the
Armenians, (Moses Chorenensis, Hist. Armen. l. ii. c. 7, p. 96, edit.
Whiston.) In the beginning of the seventh, the Persian Romance of Rostam
and Isfendiar was applauded at Mecca, (Sale's Koran, c. xxxi. p. 335.)
Yet this exposition of ludicrum novae historiae is not given by Maracci,

physician, Stephen of Edessa, (Persic. l. ii. c. 26.) The practice was
ancient; and Herodotus relates the adventures of Democedes of Crotona,
(l. iii p. 125--137.)]

[Footnote 52: See Pagi, tom. ii. p. 626. In one of the treaties an
honorable article was inserted for the toleration and burial of the
Catholics, (Menander, in Excerpt. Legat. p. 142.) Nushizad, a son of
Nushirvan, was a Christian, a rebel, and--a martyr? (D'Herbelot, p.
681.)]

D'Anquetil (p. 339--343) and Jones, (p. 153--185:) is the character
which Agathias (l. ii. p. 66) ascribes to an idiom renowned in the East
for poetical softness.]

[Footnote 54: Agathias specifies the Gorgias, Phaedon, Parmenides, and
Timaeus. Renaudot (Fabricius, Bibliot. Graec. tom. xii. p. 246--261)
does not mention this Barbaric version of Aristotle.]

[Footnote 55: Of these fables, I have seen three copies in three
different languages: 1. In Greek, translated by Simeon Seth (A.D. 1100)
from the Arabic, and published by Starck at Berlin in 1697, in 12mo. 2.
In Latin, a version from the Greek Sapientia Indorum, inserted by Pere
Poussin at the end of his edition of Pachymer, (p. 547--620, edit.
Roman.) 3. In French, from the Turkish, dedicated, in 1540, to Sultan
Soliman Contes et Fables Indiennes de Bidpai et de Lokman, par Mm.
Galland et Cardonne, Paris, 1778, 3 vols. in 12mo. Mr. Warton (History
of English Poetry, vol. i. p. 129--131) takes a larger scope. * Note:
The oldest Indian collection extant is the Pancha-tantra, (the five
collections,) analyzed by Mr. Wilson in the Transactions of the Royal
Asiat. Soc. It was translated into Persian by Barsuyah, the physician
of Nushirvan, under the name of the Fables of Bidpai, (Vidyapriya, the
Friend of Knowledge, or, as the Oriental writers understand it, the
Friend of Medicine.) It was translated into Arabic by Abdolla Ibn
Mokaffa, under the name of Kalila and Dimnah. From the Arabic it passed
into the European languages. Compare Wilson, in Trans. As. Soc. i. 52.
