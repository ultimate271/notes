## Chapter LIV: Origin And Doctrine Of The Paulicians.--Part II.

About the middle of the eight century, Constantine, surnamed Copronymus
by the worshippers of images, had made an expedition into Armenia, and
found, in the cities of Melitene and Theodosiopolis, a great number
of Paulicians, his kindred heretics. As a favor, or punishment, he
transplanted them from the banks of the Euphrates to Constantinople
and Thrace; and by this emigration their doctrine was introduced and
diffused in Europe. [21] If the sectaries of the metropolis were soon
mingled with the promiscuous mass, those of the country struck a deep
root in a foreign soil. The Paulicians of Thrace resisted the storms
of persecution, maintained a secret correspondence with their Armenian
brethren, and gave aid and comfort to their preachers, who solicited,
not without success, the infant faith of the Bulgarians. [22] In the
tenth century, they were restored and multiplied by a more powerful
colony, which John Zimisces [23] transported from the Chalybian hills
to the valleys of Mount Haemus. The Oriental clergy who would have
preferred the destruction, impatiently sighed for the absence, of the
Manichaeans: the warlike emperor had felt and esteemed their valor:
their attachment to the Saracens was pregnant with mischief; but, on
the side of the Danube, against the Barbarians of Scythia, their service
might be useful, and their loss would be desirable. Their exile in a
distant land was softened by a free toleration: the Paulicians held the
city of Philippopolis and the keys of Thrace; the Catholics were their
subjects; the Jacobite emigrants their associates: they occupied a
line of villages and castles in Macedonia and Epirus; and many native
Bulgarians were associated to the communion of arms and heresy. As long
as they were awed by power and treated with moderation, their voluntary
bands were distinguished in the armies of the empire; and the courage of
these dogs, ever greedy of war, ever thirsty of human blood, is noticed
with astonishment, and almost with reproach, by the pusillanimous
Greeks. The same spirit rendered them arrogant and contumacious: they
were easily provoked by caprice or injury; and their privileges were
often violated by the faithless bigotry of the government and clergy.
In the midst of the Norman war, two thousand five hundred Manichaeans
deserted the standard of Alexius Comnenus, [24] and retired to their
native homes. He dissembled till the moment of revenge; invited the
chiefs to a friendly conference; and punished the innocent and guilty
by imprisonment, confiscation, and baptism. In an interval of peace, the
emperor undertook the pious office of reconciling them to the church
and state: his winter quarters were fixed at Philippopolis; and the
thirteenth apostle, as he is styled by his pious daughter, consumed
whole days and nights in theological controversy. His arguments were
fortified, their obstinacy was melted, by the honors and rewards which
he bestowed on the most eminent proselytes; and a new city, surrounded
with gardens, enriched with immunities, and dignified with his own name,
was founded by Alexius for the residence of his vulgar converts. The
important station of Philippopolis was wrested from their hands; the
contumacious leaders were secured in a dungeon, or banished from their
country; and their lives were spared by the prudence, rather than the
mercy, of an emperor, at whose command a poor and solitary heretic was
burnt alive before the church of St. Sophia. [25] But the proud hope of
eradicating the prejudices of a nation was speedily overturned by the
invincible zeal of the Paulicians, who ceased to dissemble or refused to
obey. After the departure and death of Alexius, they soon resumed their
civil and religious laws. In the beginning of the thirteenth century,
their pope or primate (a manifest corruption) resided on the confines of
Bulgaria, Croatia, and Dalmatia, and governed, by his vicars, the
filial congregations of Italy and France. [26] From that aera, a minute
scrutiny might prolong and perpetuate the chain of tradition. At the end
of the last age, the sect or colony still inhabited the valleys of Mount
Haemus, where their ignorance and poverty were more frequently
tormented by the Greek clergy than by the Turkish government. The modern
Paulicians have lost all memory of their origin; and their religion
is disgraced by the worship of the cross, and the practice of bloody
sacrifice, which some captives have imported from the wilds of Tartary.
[27]

[Footnote 21: Copronymus transported his heretics; and thus says
Cedrenus, (p. 463,) who has copied the annals of Theophanes.]

[Footnote 22: Petrus Siculus, who resided nine months at Tephrice
(A.D. 870) for the ransom of captives, (p. 764,) was informed of
their intended mission, and addressed his preservative, the Historia
Manichaeorum to the new archbishop of the Bulgarians, (p. 754.)]

[Footnote 23: The colony of Paulicians and Jacobites transplanted by
John Zimisces (A.D. 970) from Armenia to Thrace, is mentioned by Zonaras
(tom. ii. l. xvii. p. 209) and Anna Comnena, (Alexiad, l. xiv. p. 450,
&c.)]

[Footnote 24: The Alexiad of Anna Comnena (l. v. p. 131, l. vi. p. 154,
155, l. xiv. p. 450-457, with the Annotations of Ducange) records
the transactions of her apostolic father with the Manichaeans, whose
abominable heresy she was desirous of refuting.]

[Footnote 26: Matt. Paris, Hist. Major, p. 267. This passage of
our English historian is alleged by Ducange in an excellent note on
Villehardouin (No. 208,) who found the Paulicians at Philippopolis the
friends of the Bulgarians.]

In the West, the first teachers of the Manichaean theology had been
repulsed by the people, or suppressed by the prince. The favor and
success of the Paulicians in the eleventh and twelfth centuries must be
imputed to the strong, though secret, discontent which armed the most
pious Christians against the church of Rome. Her avarice was oppressive,
her despotism odious; less degenerate perhaps than the Greeks in the
worship of saints and images, her innovations were more rapid and
scandalous: she had rigorously defined and imposed the doctrine of
transubstantiation: the lives of the Latin clergy were more corrupt, and
the Eastern bishops might pass for the successors of the apostles, if
they were compared with the lordly prelates, who wielded by turns
the crosier, the sceptre, and the sword. Three different roads might
introduce the Paulicians into the heart of Europe. After the conversion
of Hungary, the pilgrims who visited Jerusalem might safely follow the
course of the Danube: in their journey and return they passed through
Philippopolis; and the sectaries, disguising their name and heresy,
might accompany the French or German caravans to their respective
countries. The trade and dominion of Venice pervaded the coast of the
Adriatic, and the hospitable republic opened her bosom to foreigners of
every climate and religion. Under the Byzantine standard, the Paulicians
were often transported to the Greek provinces of Italy and Sicily: in
peace and war, they freely conversed with strangers and natives, and
their opinions were silently propagated in Rome, Milan, and the kingdoms
beyond the Alps. [28] It was soon discovered, that many thousand
Catholics of every rank, and of either sex, had embraced the Manichaean
heresy; and the flames which consumed twelve canons of Orleans was the
first act and signal of persecution. The Bulgarians, [29] a name so
innocent in its origin, so odious in its application, spread their
branches over the face of Europe. United in common hatred of idolatry
and Rome, they were connected by a form of episcopal and presbyterian
government; their various sects were discriminated by some fainter
or darker shades of theology; but they generally agreed in the two
principles, the contempt of the Old Testament and the denial of the
body of Christ, either on the cross or in the eucharist. A confession of
simple worship and blameless manners is extorted from their enemies;
and so high was their standard of perfection, that the increasing
congregations were divided into two classes of disciples, of those
who practised, and of those who aspired. It was in the country of the
Albigeois, [30] in the southern provinces of France, that the Paulicians
were most deeply implanted; and the same vicissitudes of martyrdom and
revenge which had been displayed in the neighborhood of the Euphrates,
were repeated in the thirteenth century on the banks of the Rhone. The
laws of the Eastern emperors were revived by Frederic the Second. The
insurgents of Tephrice were represented by the barons and cities of
Languedoc: Pope Innocent III. surpassed the sanguinary fame of Theodora.
It was in cruelty alone that her soldiers could equal the heroes of
the Crusades, and the cruelty of her priests was far excelled by the
founders of the Inquisition; [31] an office more adapted to confirm,
than to refute, the belief of an evil principle. The visible assemblies
of the Paulicians, or Albigeois, were extirpated by fire and sword;
and the bleeding remnant escaped by flight, concealment, or Catholic
conformity. But the invincible spirit which they had kindled still lived
and breathed in the Western world. In the state, in the church, and even
in the cloister, a latent succession was preserved of the disciples of
St. Paul; who protested against the tyranny of Rome, embraced the Bible
as the rule of faith, and purified their creed from all the visions of
the Gnostic theology. [3111] The struggles of Wickliff in England,
of Huss in Bohemia, were premature and ineffectual; but the names of
Zuinglius, Luther, and Calvin, are pronounced with gratitude as the
deliverers of nations.

[Footnote 28: The introduction of the Paulicians into Italy and France
is amply discussed by Muratori (Antiquitat. Italiae Medii Aevi, tom. v.
dissert. lx. p. 81-152) and Mosheim, (p. 379-382, 419-422.) Yet both
have overlooked a curious passage of William the Apulian, who clearly
describes them in a battle between the Greeks and Normans, A.D. 1040,
(in Muratori, Script. Rerum Ital. tom. v. p. 256:)

     Cum Graecis aderant quidam, quos pessimus error

     Fecerat amentes, et ab ipso nomen habebant.

But he is so ignorant of their doctrine as to make them a kind of
Sabellians or Patripassians.]

[Footnote 29: Bulgari, Boulgres, Bougres, a national appellation,
has been applied by the French as a term of reproach to usurers and
unnatural sinners. The Paterini, or Patelini, has been made to signify
a smooth and flattering hypocrite, such as l'Avocat Patelin of that
original and pleasant farce, (Ducange, Gloss. Latinitat. Medii et Infimi
Aevi.) The Manichaeans were likewise named Cathari or the pure, by
corruption. Gazari, &c.]

[Footnote 30: Of the laws, crusade, and persecution against the
Albigeois, a just, though general, idea is expressed by Mosheim, (p.
477-481.) The detail may be found in the ecclesiastical historians,
ancient and modern, Catholics and Protestants; and amongst these Fleury
is the most impartial and moderate.]

[Footnote 31: The Acts (Liber Sententiarum) of the Inquisition
of Tholouse (A.D. 1307-1323) have been published by Limborch,
(Amstelodami, 1692,) with a previous History of the Inquisition in
general. They deserved a more learned and critical editor. As we must
not calumniate even Satan, or the Holy Office, I will observe, that of a
list of criminals which fills nineteen folio pages, only fifteen men and
four women were delivered to the secular arm.]

[Footnote 3111: The popularity of "Milner's History of the Church"
with some readers, may make it proper to observe, that his attempt to
exculpate the Paulicians from the charge of Gnosticism or Manicheism
is in direct defiance, if not in ignorance, of all the original
authorities. Gibbon himself, it appears, was not acquainted with the
work of Photius, "Contra Manicheos Repullulantes," the first book of
which was edited by Montfaucon, Bibliotheca Coisliniana, pars ii. p.
349, 375, the whole by Wolf, in his Anecdota Graeca. Hamburg 1722.

A philosopher, who calculates the degree of their merit and the value of
their reformation, will prudently ask from what articles of faith, above
or against our reason, they have enfranchised the Christians; for such
enfranchisement is doubtless a benefit so far as it may be compatible
with truth and piety. After a fair discussion, we shall rather be
surprised by the timidity, than scandalized by the freedom, of our first
reformers. [32] With the Jews, they adopted the belief and defence of
all the Hebrew Scriptures, with all their prodigies, from the garden of
Eden to the visions of the prophet Daniel; and they were bound, like the
Catholics, to justify against the Jews the abolition of a divine law.
In the great mysteries of the Trinity and Incarnation the reformers were
severely orthodox: they freely adopted the theology of the four, or the
six first councils; and with the Athanasian creed, they pronounced
the eternal damnation of all who did not believe the Catholic faith.
Transubstantiation, the invisible change of the bread and wine into the
body and blood of Christ, is a tenet that may defy the power of argument
and pleasantry; but instead of consulting the evidence of their senses,
of their sight, their feeling, and their taste, the first Protestants
were entangled in their own scruples, and awed by the words of Jesus
in the institution of the sacrament. Luther maintained a corporeal, and
Calvin a real, presence of Christ in the eucharist; and the opinion
of Zuinglius, that it is no more than a spiritual communion, a simple
memorial, has slowly prevailed in the reformed churches. [33] But the
loss of one mystery was amply compensated by the stupendous doctrines of
original sin, redemption, faith, grace, and predestination, which have
been strained from the epistles of St. Paul. These subtile questions had
most assuredly been prepared by the fathers and schoolmen; but the final
improvement and popular use may be attributed to the first reformers,
who enforced them as the absolute and essential terms of salvation.
Hitherto the weight of supernatural belief inclines against the
Protestants; and many a sober Christian would rather admit that a wafer
is God, than that God is a cruel and capricious tyrant.

[Footnote 32: The opinions and proceedings of the reformers are exposed
in the second part of the general history of Mosheim; but the balance,
which he has held with so clear an eye, and so steady a hand, begins to
incline in favor of his Lutheran brethren.]

[Footnote 33: Under Edward VI. our reformation was more bold and
perfect, but in the fundamental articles of the church of England,
a strong and explicit declaration against the real presence was
obliterated in the original copy, to please the people or the Lutherans,
or Queen Elizabeth, (Burnet's History of the Reformation, vol. ii. p.
82, 128, 302.)]

Yet the services of Luther and his rivals are solid and important; and
the philosopher must own his obligations to these fearless enthusiasts.
[34] I. By their hands the lofty fabric of superstition, from the abuse
of indulgences to the intercesson of the Virgin, has been levelled
with the ground. Myriads of both sexes of the monastic profession were
restored to the liberty and labors of social life. A hierarchy of saints
and angels, of imperfect and subordinate deities, were stripped of their
temporal power, and reduced to the enjoyment of celestial happiness;
their images and relics were banished from the church; and the credulity
of the people was no longer nourished with the daily repetition of
miracles and visions. The imitation of Paganism was supplied by a pure
and spiritual worship of prayer and thanksgiving, the most worthy
of man, the least unworthy of the Deity. It only remains to observe,
whether such sublime simplicity be consistent with popular devotion;
whether the vulgar, in the absence of all visible objects, will not
be inflamed by enthusiasm, or insensibly subside in languor and
indifference. II. The chain of authority was broken, which restrains
the bigot from thinking as he pleases, and the slave from speaking as he
thinks: the popes, fathers, and councils, were no longer the supreme
and infallible judges of the world; and each Christian was taught
to acknowledge no law but the Scriptures, no interpreter but his own
conscience. This freedom, however, was the consequence, rather than
the design, of the Reformation. The patriot reformers were ambitious of
succeeding the tyrants whom they had dethroned. They imposed with equal
rigor their creeds and confessions; they asserted the right of the
magistrate to punish heretics with death. The pious or personal
animosity of Calvin proscribed in Servetus [35] the guilt of his own
rebellion; [36] and the flames of Smithfield, in which he was afterwards
consumed, had been kindled for the Anabaptists by the zeal of Cranmer.
[37] The nature of the tiger wa s the same, but he was gradually
deprived of his teeth and fangs. A spiritual and temporal kingdom was
possessed by the Roman pontiff; the Protestant doctors were subjects
of an humble rank, without revenue or jurisdiction. His decrees were
consecrated by the antiquity of the Catholic church: their arguments
and disputes were submitted to the people; and their appeal to private
judgment was accepted beyond their wishes, by curiosity and enthusiasm.
Since the days of Luther and Calvin, a secret reformation has been
silently working in the bosom of the reformed churches; many weeds of
prejudice were eradicated; and the disciples of Erasmus [38] diffused
a spirit of freedom and moderation. The liberty of conscience has
been claimed as a common benefit, an inalienable right: [39] the free
governments of Holland [40] and England [41] introduced the practice of
toleration; and the narrow allowance of the laws has been enlarged by
the prudence and humanity of the times. In the exercise, the mind has
understood the limits of its powers, and the words and shadows that
might amuse the child can no longer satisfy his manly reason. The
volumes of controversy are overspread with cobwebs: the doctrine of a
Protestant church is far removed from the knowledge or belief of its
private members; and the forms of orthodoxy, the articles of faith,
are subscribed with a sigh, or a smile, by the modern clergy. Yet the
friends of Christianity are alarmed at the boundless impulse of inquiry
and scepticism. The predictions of the Catholics are accomplished: the
web of mystery is unravelled by the Arminians, Arians, and Socinians,
whose number must not be computed from their separate congregations; and
the pillars of Revelation are shaken by those men who preserve the name
without the substance of religion, who indulge the license without the
temper of philosophy. [42] [4211]

[Footnote 34: "Had it not been for such men as Luther and myself,"
said the fanatic Whiston to Halley the philosopher, "you would now be
kneeling before an image of St. Winifred."]

[Footnote 35: The article of Servet in the Dictionnaire Critique of
Chauffepie is the best account which I have seen of this shameful
transaction. See likewise the Abbe d'Artigny, Nouveaux Memoires
d'Histoire, &c., tom. ii. p. 55-154.]

[Footnote 36: I am more deeply scandalized at the single execution of
Servetus, than at the hecatombs which have blazed in the Auto de Fes of
Spain and Portugal. 1. The zeal of Calvin seems to have been envenomed
by personal malice, and perhaps envy. He accused his adversary before
their common enemies, the judges of Vienna, and betrayed, for his
destruction, the sacred trust of a private correspondence. 2. The deed
of cruelty was not varnished by the pretence of danger to the church or
state. In his passage through Geneva, Servetus was a harmless stranger,
who neither preached, nor printed, nor made proselytes. 3. A Catholic
inquisition yields the same obedience which he requires, but Calvin
violated the golden rule of doing as he would be done by; a rule which I
read in a moral treatise of Isocrates (in Nicocle, tom. i. p. 93, edit.
Battie) four hundred years before the publication of the Gospel. * Note:
Gibbon has not accurately rendered the sense of this passage, which does
not contain the maxim of charity Do unto others as you would they should
do unto you, but simply the maxim of justice, Do not to others the which
would offend you if they should do it to you.--G.]

[Footnote 37: See Burnet, vol. ii. p. 84-86. The sense and humanity of
the young king were oppressed by the authority of the primate.]

[Footnote 38: Erasmus may be considered as the father of rational
theology. After a slumber of a hundred years, it was revived by the
Arminians of Holland, Grotius, Limborch, and Le Clerc; in England by
Chillingworth, the latitudinarians of Cambridge, (Burnet, Hist. of Own
Times, vol. i. p. 261-268, octavo edition.) Tillotson, Clarke, Hoadley,
&c.]

[Footnote 39: I am sorry to observe, that the three writers of the
last age, by whom the rights of toleration have been so nobly defended,
Bayle, Leibnitz, and Locke, are all laymen and philosophers.]

[Footnote 40: See the excellent chapter of Sir William Temple on the
Religion of the United Provinces. I am not satisfied with Grotius, (de
Rebus Belgicis, Annal. l. i. p. 13, 14, edit. in 12mo.,) who approves
the Imperial laws of persecution, and only condemns the bloody tribunal
of the inquisition.]

[Footnote 41: Sir William Blackstone (Commentaries, vol. iv. p. 53,
54) explains the law of England as it was fixed at the Revolution. The
exceptions of Papists, and of those who deny the Trinity, would still
have a tolerable scope for persecution if the national spirit were not
more effectual than a hundred statutes.]

[Footnote 42: I shall recommend to public animadversion two passages in
Dr. Priestley, which betray the ultimate tendency of his opinions. At
the first of these (Hist. of the Corruptions of Christianity, vol. i.
p. 275, 276) the priest, at the second (vol. ii. p. 484) the magistrate,
may tremble!]

[Footnote 4211: There is something ludicrous, if it were not offensive,
in Gibbon holding up to "public animadversion" the opinions of any
believer in Christianity, however imperfect his creed. The observations
which the whole of this passage on the effects of the reformation,
in which much truth and justice is mingled with much prejudice, would
suggest, could not possibly be compressed into a note; and would indeed
embrace the whole religious and irreligious history of the time which
has elapsed since Gibbon wrote.--M.]
