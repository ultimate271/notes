## Chapter XXIV: The Retreat And Death Of Julian.--Part IV.

The honor, as well as interest, of Julian, forbade him to consume his
time under the impregnable walls of Ctesiphon and as often as he defied
the Barbarians, who defended the city, to meet him on the open plain,
they prudently replied, that if he desired to exercise his valor,
he might seek the army of the Great King. He felt the insult, and he
accepted the advice. Instead of confining his servile march to the banks
of the Euphrates and Tigris, he resolved to imitate the adventurous
spirit of Alexander, and boldly to advance into the inland provinces,
till he forced his rival to contend with him, perhaps in the plains of
Arbela, for the empire of Asia. The magnanimity of Julian was applauded
and betrayed, by the arts of a noble Persian, who, in the cause of
his country, had generously submitted to act a part full of danger, of
falsehood, and of shame. [77] With a train of faithful followers, he
deserted to the Imperial camp; exposed, in a specious tale, the injuries
which he had sustained; exaggerated the cruelty of Sapor, the discontent
of the people, and the weakness of the monarchy; and confidently offered
himself as the hostage and guide of the Roman march. The most rational
grounds of suspicion were urged, without effect, by the wisdom and
experience of Hormisdas; and the credulous Julian, receiving the traitor
into his bosom, was persuaded to issue a hasty order, which, in the
opinion of mankind, appeared to arraign his prudence, and to endanger
his safety. He destroyed, in a single hour, the whole navy, which had
been transported above five hundred miles, at so great an expense of
toil, of treasure, and of blood. Twelve, or, at the most, twenty-two
small vessels were saved, to accompany, on carriages, the march of the
army, and to form occasional bridges for the passage of the rivers.
A supply of twenty days' provisions was reserved for the use of the
soldiers; and the rest of the magazines, with a fleet of eleven hundred
vessels, which rode at anchor in the Tigris, were abandoned to the
flames, by the absolute command of the emperor. The Christian bishops,
Gregory and Augustin, insult the madness of the Apostate, who executed,
with his own hands, the sentence of divine justice. Their authority, of
less weight, perhaps, in a military question, is confirmed by the cool
judgment of an experienced soldier, who was himself spectator of the
conflagration, and who could not disapprove the reluctant murmurs of the
troops. [78] Yet there are not wanting some specious, and perhaps solid,
reasons, which might justify the resolution of Julian. The navigation of
the Euphrates never ascended above Babylon, nor that of the Tigris above
Opis. [79] The distance of the last-mentioned city from the Roman camp
was not very considerable: and Julian must soon have renounced the vain
and impracticable attempt of forcing upwards a great fleet against the
stream of a rapid river, [80] which in several places was embarrassed
by natural or artificial cataracts. [81] The power of sails and oars was
insufficient; it became necessary to tow the ships against the current
of the river; the strength of twenty thousand soldiers was exhausted
in this tedious and servile labor, and if the Romans continued to march
along the banks of the Tigris, they could only expect to return home
without achieving any enterprise worthy of the genius or fortune of
their leader. If, on the contrary, it was advisable to advance into the
inland country, the destruction of the fleet and magazines was the
only measure which could save that valuable prize from the hands of the
numerous and active troops which might suddenly be poured from the gates
of Ctesiphon. Had the arms of Julian been victorious, we should now
admire the conduct, as well as the courage, of a hero, who, by depriving
his soldiers of the hopes of a retreat, left them only the alternative
of death or conquest. [82]

abbreviators, (Sextus Rufus and Victor,) and the casual hints of
Libanius (Orat. Parent. c. 134, p. 357) and Ammianus, (xxiv. 7.) The
course of genuine history is interrupted by a most unseasonable chasm in
the text of Ammianus.]

faint apology for his hero; who, according to Ammianus, pronounced his
own condemnation by a tardy and ineffectual attempt to extinguish the
flames.]

to interrupt the navigation of the river, (Strabo, l. xv. p. 1075.

The cumbersome train of artillery and wagons, which retards the
operations of a modern army, were in a great measure unknown in the
camps of the Romans. [83] Yet, in every age, the subsistence of sixty
thousand men must have been one of the most important cares of a prudent
general; and that subsistence could only be drawn from his own or from
the enemy's country. Had it been possible for Julian to maintain a
bridge of communication on the Tigris, and to preserve the conquered
places of Assyria, a desolated province could not afford any large or
regular supplies, in a season of the year when the lands were covered
by the inundation of the Euphrates, [84] and the unwholesome air was
darkened with swarms of innumerable insects. [85] The appearance of the
hostile country was far more inviting. The extensive region that lies
between the River Tigris and the mountains of Media, was filled with
villages and towns; and the fertile soil, for the most part, was in
a very improved state of cultivation. Julian might expect, that a
conqueror, who possessed the two forcible instruments of persuasion,
steel and gold, would easily procure a plentiful subsistence from the
fears or avarice of the natives. But, on the approach of the Romans, the
rich and smiling prospect was instantly blasted. Wherever they moved,
the inhabitants deserted the open villages, and took shelter in the
fortified towns; the cattle was driven away; the grass and ripe corn
were consumed with fire; and, as soon as the flames had subsided which
interrupted the march of Julian, he beheld the melancholy face of a
smoking and naked desert. This desperate but effectual method of defence
can only be executed by the enthusiasm of a people who prefer their
independence to their property; or by the rigor of an arbitrary
government, which consults the public safety without submitting to their
inclinations the liberty of choice. On the present occasion the zeal
and obedience of the Persians seconded the commands of Sapor; and
the emperor was soon reduced to the scanty stock of provisions, which
continually wasted in his hands. Before they were entirely consumed, he
might still have reached the wealthy and unwarlike cities of Ecbatana or
Susa, by the effort of a rapid and well-directed march; [86] but he was
deprived of this last resource by his ignorance of the roads, and by the
perfidy of his guides. The Romans wandered several days in the country
to the eastward of Bagdad; the Persian deserter, who had artfully led
them into the spare, escaped from their resentment; and his followers,
as soon as they were put to the torture, confessed the secret of the
conspiracy. The visionary conquests of Hyrcania and India, which had so
long amused, now tormented, the mind of Julian. Conscious that his own
imprudence was the cause of the public distress, he anxiously balanced
the hopes of safety or success, without obtaining a satisfactory answer,
either from gods or men. At length, as the only practicable measure, he
embraced the resolution of directing his steps towards the banks of
the Tigris, with the design of saving the army by a hasty march to
the confines of Corduene; a fertile and friendly province, which
acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome. The desponding troops obeyed
the signal of the retreat, only seventy days after they had passed the
Chaboras, with the sanguine expectation of subverting the throne of
Persia. [87]

inconveniency of the flood, the heat, and the insects. The lands of
Assyria, oppressed by the Turks, and ravaged by the Curds or Arabs,
yield an increase of ten, fifteen, and twenty fold, for the seed which
is cast into the ground by the wretched and unskillful husbandmen.

Thevenot, (part i. l. i. ii. p. 209-245,) 128 hours of march from
Bagdad to Ecbatana, or Hamadan. These measures cannot exceed an ordinary
parasang, or three Roman miles.]

[Footnote 87: The march of Julian from Ctesiphon is circumstantially,
but not clearly, described by Ammianus, (xxiv. 7, 8,) Libanius, (Orat.
Parent. c. 134, p. 357,) and Zosimus, (l. iii. p. 183.) The two last
seem ignorant that their conqueror was retreating; and Libanius absurdly
confines him to the banks of the Tigris.]

As long as the Romans seemed to advance into the country, their march
was observed and insulted from a distance, by several bodies of Persian
cavalry; who, showing themselves sometimes in loose, and sometimes
in close order, faintly skirmished with the advanced guards. These
detachments were, however, supported by a much greater force; and the
heads of the columns were no sooner pointed towards the Tigris than a
cloud of dust arose on the plain. The Romans, who now aspired only to
the permission of a safe and speedy retreat, endeavored to persuade
themselves, that this formidable appearance was occasioned by a troop
of wild asses, or perhaps by the approach of some friendly Arabs. They
halted, pitched their tents, fortified their camp, passed the whole
night in continual alarms; and discovered at the dawn of day, that
they were surrounded by an army of Persians. This army, which might be
considered only as the van of the Barbarians, was soon followed by the
main body of cuirassiers, archers, and elephants, commanded by Meranes,
a general of rank and reputation. He was accompanied by two of the
king's sons, and many of the principal satraps; and fame and expectation
exaggerated the strength of the remaining powers, which slowly advanced
under the conduct of Sapor himself. As the Romans continued their march,
their long array, which was forced to bend or divide, according to the
varieties of the ground, afforded frequent and favorable opportunities
to their vigilant enemies. The Persians repeatedly charged with fury;
they were repeatedly repulsed with firmness; and the action at Maronga,
which almost deserved the name of a battle, was marked by a considerable
loss of satraps and elephants, perhaps of equal value in the eyes of
their monarch. These splendid advantages were not obtained without
an adequate slaughter on the side of the Romans: several officers of
distinction were either killed or wounded; and the emperor himself, who,
on all occasions of danger, inspired and guided the valor of his troops,
was obliged to expose his person, and exert his abilities. The weight of
offensive and defensive arms, which still constituted the strength and
safety of the Romans, disabled them from making any long or effectual
pursuit; and as the horsemen of the East were trained to dart their
javelins, and shoot their arrows, at full speed, and in every possible
direction, [88] the cavalry of Persia was never more formidable than in
the moment of a rapid and disorderly flight. But the most certain and
irreparable loss of the Romans was that of time. The hardy veterans,
accustomed to the cold climate of Gaul and Germany, fainted under the
sultry heat of an Assyrian summer; their vigor was exhausted by the
incessant repetition of march and combat; and the progress of the army
was suspended by the precautions of a slow and dangerous retreat, in
the presence of an active enemy. Every day, every hour, as the supply
diminished, the value and price of subsistence increased in the Roman
camp. [89] Julian, who always contented himself with such food as a
hungry soldier would have disdained, distributed, for the use of the
troops, the provisions of the Imperial household, and whatever could be
spared, from the sumpter-horses, of the tribunes and generals. But this
feeble relief served only to aggravate the sense of the public distress;
and the Romans began to entertain the most gloomy apprehensions that,
before they could reach the frontiers of the empire, they should all
perish, either by famine, or by the sword of the Barbarians. [90]

[Footnote 88: Chardin, the most judicious of modern travellers,
describes (tom. ii. p. 57, 58, &c., edit. in 4to.) the education and
dexterity of the Persian horsemen. Brissonius (de Regno Persico, p. 650
651, &c.,) has collected the testimonies of antiquity.]

[Footnote 89: In Mark Antony's retreat, an attic choenix sold for fifty
drachmae, or, in other words, a pound of flour for twelve or fourteen
shillings barley bread was sold for its weight in silver. It is
impossible to peruse the interesting narrative of Plutarch, (tom. v. p.
102-116,) without perceiving that Mark Antony and Julian were pursued by
the same enemies, and involved in the same distress.]

of Antioch appears ignorant that the troops were hungry.]

While Julian struggled with the almost insuperable difficulties of his
situation, the silent hours of the night were still devoted to study
and contemplation. Whenever he closed his eyes in short and interrupted
slumbers, his mind was agitated with painful anxiety; nor can it be
thought surprising, that the Genius of the empire should once more
appear before him, covering with a funeral veil his head, and his horn
of abundance, and slowly retiring from the Imperial tent. The monarch
started from his couch, and stepping forth to refresh his wearied
spirits with the coolness of the midnight air, he beheld a fiery meteor,
which shot athwart the sky, and suddenly vanished. Julian was convinced
that he had seen the menacing countenance of the god of war; [91]
the council which he summoned, of Tuscan Haruspices, [92] unanimously
pronounced that he should abstain from action; but on this occasion,
necessity and reason were more prevalent than superstition; and the
trumpets sounded at the break of day. The army marched through a hilly
country; and the hills had been secretly occupied by the Persians.
Julian led the van with the skill and attention of a consummate general;
he was alarmed by the intelligence that his rear was suddenly attacked.
The heat of the weather had tempted him to lay aside his cuirass; but
he snatched a shield from one of his attendants, and hastened, with a
sufficient reenforcement, to the relief of the rear-guard. A similar
danger recalled the intrepid prince to the defence of the front; and,
as he galloped through the columns, the centre of the left was attacked,
and almost overpowered by the furious charge of the Persian cavalry and
elephants. This huge body was soon defeated, by the well-timed evolution
of the light infantry, who aimed their weapons, with dexterity
and effect, against the backs of the horsemen, and the legs of the
elephants. The Barbarians fled; and Julian, who was foremost in every
danger, animated the pursuit with his voice and gestures. His trembling
guards, scattered and oppressed by the disorderly throng of friends and
enemies, reminded their fearless sovereign that he was without armor;
and conjured him to decline the fall of the impending ruin. As they
exclaimed, [93] a cloud of darts and arrows was discharged from the
flying squadrons; and a javelin, after razing the skin of his arm,
transpierced the ribs, and fixed in the inferior part of the liver.
Julian attempted to draw the deadly weapon from his side; but his
fingers were cut by the sharpness of the steel, and he fell senseless
from his horse. His guards flew to his relief; and the wounded emperor
was gently raised from the ground, and conveyed out of the tumult of the
battle into an adjacent tent. The report of the melancholy event passed
from rank to rank; but the grief of the Romans inspired them with
invincible valor, and the desire of revenge. The bloody and obstinate
conflict was maintained by the two armies, till they were separated by
the total darkness of the night. The Persians derived some honor
from the advantage which they obtained against the left wing, where
Anatolius, master of the offices, was slain, and the praefect Sallust
very narrowly escaped. But the event of the day was adverse to the
Barbarians. They abandoned the field; their two generals, Meranes and
Nohordates, [94] fifty nobles or satraps, and a multitude of their
bravest soldiers; and the success of the Romans, if Julian had survived,
might have been improved into a decisive and useful victory.

[Footnote 91: Ammian. xxv. 2. Julian had sworn in a passion, nunquam
se Marti sacra facturum, (xxiv. 6.) Such whimsical quarrels were not
uncommon between the gods and their insolent votaries; and even the
prudent Augustus, after his fleet had been twice shipwrecked, excluded
Neptune from the honors of public processions. See Hume's Philosophical
Reflections. Essays, vol. ii. p. 418.]

science, which had been invented in Hetruria; and professed to derive
their knowledge of signs and omens from the ancient books of Tarquitius,
a Tuscan sage.]

practice to comfort the families of his deceased satraps, by sending
them, as a present, the heads of the guards and officers who had not
fallen by their master's side. Libanius, de nece Julian. ulcis. c. xiii.
p. 163.]

The first words that Julian uttered, after his recovery from the
fainting fit into which he had been thrown by loss of blood, were
expressive of his martial spirit. He called for his horse and arms,
and was impatient to rush into the battle. His remaining strength was
exhausted by the painful effort; and the surgeons, who examined his
wound, discovered the symptoms of approaching death. He employed
the awful moments with the firm temper of a hero and a sage; the
philosophers who had accompanied him in this fatal expedition, compared
the tent of Julian with the prison of Socrates; and the spectators,
whom duty, or friendship, or curiosity, had assembled round his couch,
listened with respectful grief to the funeral oration of their dying
emperor. [95] "Friends and fellow-soldiers, the seasonable period of my
departure is now arrived, and I discharge, with the cheerfulness of a
ready debtor, the demands of nature. I have learned from philosophy, how
much the soul is more excellent than the body; and that the separation
of the nobler substance should be the subject of joy, rather than of
affliction. I have learned from religion, that an early death has often
been the reward of piety; [96] and I accept, as a favor of the gods, the
mortal stroke that secures me from the danger of disgracing a character,
which has hitherto been supported by virtue and fortitude. I die without
remorse, as I have lived without guilt. I am pleased to reflect on the
innocence of my private life; and I can affirm with confidence, that
the supreme authority, that emanation of the Divine Power, has been
preserved in my hands pure and immaculate. Detesting the corrupt and
destructive maxims of despotism, I have considered the happiness of the
people as the end of government. Submitting my actions to the laws of
prudence, of justice, and of moderation, I have trusted the event to
the care of Providence. Peace was the object of my counsels, as long
as peace was consistent with the public welfare; but when the imperious
voice of my country summoned me to arms, I exposed my person to the
dangers of war, with the clear foreknowledge (which I had acquired from
the art of divination) that I was destined to fall by the sword. I now
offer my tribute of gratitude to the Eternal Being, who has not suffered
me to perish by the cruelty of a tyrant, by the secret dagger of
conspiracy, or by the slow tortures of lingering disease. He has
given me, in the midst of an honorable career, a splendid and glorious
departure from this world; and I hold it equally absurd, equally
base, to solicit, or to decline, the stroke of fate. This much I have
attempted to say; but my strength fails me, and I feel the approach
of death. I shall cautiously refrain from any word that may tend to
influence your suffrages in the election of an emperor. My choice might
be imprudent or injudicious; and if it should not be ratified by the
consent of the army, it might be fatal to the person whom I should
recommend. I shall only, as a good citizen, express my hopes, that the
Romans may be blessed with the government of a virtuous sovereign."
After this discourse, which Julian pronounced in a firm and gentle tone
of voice, he distributed, by a military testament, [97] the remains
of his private fortune; and making some inquiry why Anatolius was not
present, he understood, from the answer of Sallust, that Anatolius
was killed; and bewailed, with amiable inconsistency, the loss of
his friend. At the same time he reproved the immoderate grief of the
spectators; and conjured them not to disgrace, by unmanly tears, the
fate of a prince, who in a few moments would be united with heaven, and
with the stars. [98] The spectators were silent; and Julian entered into
a metaphysical argument with the philosophers Priscus and Maximus, on
the nature of the soul. The efforts which he made, of mind as well as
body, most probably hastened his death. His wound began to bleed with
fresh violence; his respiration was embarrassed by the swelling of the
veins; he called for a draught of cold water, and, as soon as he had
drank it, expired without pain, about the hour of midnight. Such was
the end of that extraordinary man, in the thirty-second year of his
age, after a reign of one year and about eight months, from the death
of Constantius. In his last moments he displayed, perhaps with some
ostentation, the love of virtue and of fame, which had been the ruling
passions of his life. [99]

[Footnote 95: The character and situation of Julian might countenance
the suspicion that he had previously composed the elaborate oration,
which Ammianus heard, and has transcribed. The version of the Abbe de la
Bleterie is faithful and elegant. I have followed him in expressing
the Platonic idea of emanations, which is darkly insinuated in the
original.]

[Footnote 96: Herodotus (l. i. c. 31,) has displayed that doctrine in
an agreeable tale. Yet the Jupiter, (in the 16th book of the Iliad,) who
laments with tears of blood the death of Sarpedon his son, had a very
imperfect notion of happiness or glory beyond the grave.]

[Footnote 97: The soldiers who made their verbal or nuncupatory
testaments, upon actual service, (in procinctu,) were exempted from the
formalities of the Roman law. See Heineccius, (Antiquit. Jur. Roman.
tom. i. p. 504,) and Montesquieu, (Esprit des Loix, l. xxvii.)]

[Footnote 98: This union of the human soul with the divine aethereal
substance of the universe, is the ancient doctrine of Pythagoras and
Plato: but it seems to exclude any personal or conscious immortality.

ii. p. 199-216.]

[Footnote 99: The whole relation of the death of Julian is given by
Ammianus, (xxv. 3,) an intelligent spectator. Libanius, who turns with
horror from the scene, has supplied some circumstances, (Orat. Parental.
c 136-140, p. 359-362.) The calumnies of Gregory, and the legends
of more recent saints, may now be silently despised. * Note: A very
remarkable fragment of Eunapius describes, not without spirit, the
struggle between the terror of the army on account of their perilous
situation, and their grief for the death of Julian. "Even the vulgar
felt that they would soon provide a general, but such a general
as Julian they would never find, even though a god in the form of
man--Julian, who, with a mind equal to the divinity, triumphed over
the evil propensities of human nature,--* * who held commerce with
immaterial beings while yet in the material body--who condescended to
rule because a ruler was necessary to the welfare of mankind." Mai, Nov.
Coll. ii. 261. Eunapius in Niebuhr, 69.]

The triumph of Christianity, and the calamities of the empire, may, in
some measure, be ascribed to Julian himself, who had neglected to
secure the future execution of his designs, by the timely and judicious
nomination of an associate and successor. But the royal race of
Constantius Chlorus was reduced to his own person; and if he entertained
any serious thoughts of investing with the purple the most worthy among
the Romans, he was diverted from his resolution by the difficulty of the
choice, the jealousy of power, the fear of ingratitude, and the natural
presumption of health, of youth, and of prosperity. His unexpected death
left the empire without a master, and without an heir, in a state of
perplexity and danger, which, in the space of fourscore years, had never
been experienced, since the election of Diocletian. In a government
which had almost forgotten the distinction of pure and noble blood, the
superiority of birth was of little moment; the claims of official rank
were accidental and precarious; and the candidates, who might aspire to
ascend the vacant throne could be supported only by the consciousness of
personal merit, or by the hopes of popular favor. But the situation of
a famished army, encompassed on all sides by a host of Barbarians,
shortened the moments of grief and deliberation. In this scene of terror
and distress, the body of the deceased prince, according to his own
directions, was decently embalmed; and, at the dawn of day, the generals
convened a military senate, at which the commanders of the legions, and
the officers both of cavalry and infantry, were invited to assist.
Three or four hours of the night had not passed away without some secret
cabals; and when the election of an emperor was proposed, the spirit of
faction began to agitate the assembly. Victor and Arinthaeus collected
the remains of the court of Constantius; the friends of Julian attached
themselves to the Gallic chiefs, Dagalaiphus and Nevitta; and the
most fatal consequences might be apprehended from the discord of two
factions, so opposite in their character and interest, in their maxims
of government, and perhaps in their religious principles. The superior
virtues of Sallust could alone reconcile their divisions, and unite
their suffrages; and the venerable praefect would immediately have been
declared the successor of Julian, if he himself, with sincere and modest
firmness, had not alleged his age and infirmities, so unequal to the
weight of the diadem. The generals, who were surprised and perplexed by
his refusal, showed some disposition to adopt the salutary advice of an
inferior officer, [100] that they should act as they would have acted
in the absence of the emperor; that they should exert their abilities
to extricate the army from the present distress; and, if they were
fortunate enough to reach the confines of Mesopotamia, they should
proceed with united and deliberate counsels in the election of a lawful
sovereign. While they debated, a few voices saluted Jovian, who was no
more than first [101] of the domestics, with the names of Emperor and
Augustus. The tumultuary acclamation [101a] was instantly repeated by
the guards who surrounded the tent, and passed, in a few minutes, to the
extremities of the line. The new prince, astonished with his own fortune
was hastily invested with the Imperial ornaments, and received an oath
of fidelity from the generals, whose favor and protection he so lately
solicited. The strongest recommendation of Jovian was the merit of his
father, Count Varronian, who enjoyed, in honorable retirement, the fruit
of his long services. In the obscure freedom of a private station,
the son indulged his taste for wine and women; yet he supported, with
credit, the character of a Christian [102] and a soldier. Without being
conspicuous for any of the ambitious qualifications which excite
the admiration and envy of mankind, the comely person of Jovian, his
cheerful temper, and familiar wit, had gained the affection of his
fellow-soldiers; and the generals of both parties acquiesced in a
popular election, which had not been conducted by the arts of their
enemies. The pride of this unexpected elevation was moderated by the
just apprehension, that the same day might terminate the life and reign
of the new emperor. The pressing voice of necessity was obeyed without
delay; and the first orders issued by Jovian, a few hours after his
predecessor had expired, were to prosecute a march, which could alone
extricate the Romans from their actual distress. [103]

modest and judicious historian describes the scene of the election, at
which he was undoubtedly present, (xxv. 5.)]

the name of Julian, restored, as they fondly thought, to health, not

[Footnote 102: The ecclesiastical historians, Socrates, (l. iii. c. 22,)
Sozomen, (l. vi. c. 3,) and Theodoret, (l. iv. c. 1,) ascribe to Jovian
the merit of a confessor under the preceding reign; and piously suppose
that he refused the purple, till the whole army unanimously exclaimed
that they were Christians. Ammianus, calmly pursuing his narrative,
overthrows the legend by a single sentence. Hostiis pro Joviano extisque

portrait of Jovian; to which the younger Victor has added some

remarkably distinguished by elegance of style, critical disquisition,
and religious prejudice.]
