## Chapter XXXVIII: Reign Of Clovis.--Part VI.

General Observations On The Fall Of The Roman Empire In The West.


The Greeks, after their country had been reduced into a province,
imputed the triumphs of Rome, not to the merit, but to the fortune, of
the republic. The inconstant goddess, who so blindly distributes and
resumes her favors, had now consented (such was the language of envious
flattery) to resign her wings, to descend from her globe, and to fix her
firm and immutable throne on the banks of the Tyber. [1000] A wiser Greek,
who has composed, with a philosophic spirit, the memorable history
of his own times, deprived his countrymen of this vain and delusive
comfort, by opening to their view the deep foundations of the greatness
of Rome. [2000] The fidelity of the citizens to each other, and to the
state, was confirmed by the habits of education, and the prejudices of
religion. Honor, as well as virtue, was the principle of the republic;
the ambitious citizens labored to deserve the solemn glories of a
triumph; and the ardor of the Roman youth was kindled into active
emulation, as often as they beheld the domestic images of their
ancestors. [3000] The temperate struggles of the patricians and plebeians
had finally established the firm and equal balance of the constitution;
which united the freedom of popular assemblies, with the authority and
wisdom of a senate, and the executive powers of a regal magistrate. When
the consul displayed the standard of the republic, each citizen bound
himself, by the obligation of an oath, to draw his sword in the cause
of his country, till he had discharged the sacred duty by a military
service of ten years. This wise institution continually poured into the
field the rising generations of freemen and soldiers; and their numbers
were reenforced by the warlike and populous states of Italy, who, after
a brave resistance, had yielded to the valor and embraced the alliance,
of the Romans. The sage historian, who excited the virtue of the younger
Scipio, and beheld the ruin of Carthage, [4000] has accurately described
their military system; their levies, arms, exercises, subordination,
marches, encampments; and the invincible legion, superior in active
strength to the Macedonian phalanx of Philip and Alexander. From these
institutions of peace and war Polybius has deduced the spirit and
success of a people, incapable of fear, and impatient of repose. The
ambitious design of conquest, which might have been defeated by the
seasonable conspiracy of mankind, was attempted and achieved; and the
perpetual violation of justice was maintained by the political virtues
of prudence and courage. The arms of the republic, sometimes vanquished
in battle, always victorious in war, advanced with rapid steps to the
Euphrates, the Danube, the Rhine, and the Ocean; and the images of gold,
or silver, or brass, that might serve to represent the nations and their
kings, were successively broken by the iron monarchy of Rome. [5000]

[Footnote 1000: Such are the figurative expressions of Plutarch, (Opera,
tom. ii. p. 318, edit. Wechel,) to whom, on the faith of his son
Lamprias, (Fabricius, Bibliot. Graec. tom. iii. p. 341,) I shall boldly
impute the malicious declamation. The same opinions had prevailed among
the Greeks two hundred and fifty years before Plutarch; and to confute
them is the professed intention of Polybius, (Hist. l. i. p. 90, edit.
Gronov. Amstel. 1670.)]

[Footnote 2000: See the inestimable remains of the sixth book of Polybius,
and many other parts of his general history, particularly a digression
in the seventeenth book, in which he compares the phalanx and the
legion.]

[Footnote 3000: Sallust, de Bell. Jugurthin. c. 4. Such were the generous
professions of P. Scipio and Q. Maximus. The Latin historian had read
and most probably transcribes, Polybius, their contemporary and friend.]

[Footnote 4000: While Carthage was in flames, Scipio repeated two lines
of the Iliad, which express the destruction of Troy, acknowledging to
Polybius, his friend and preceptor, (Polyb. in Excerpt. de Virtut. et
Vit. tom. ii. p. 1455-1465,) that while he recollected the vicissitudes
of human affairs, he inwardly applied them to the future calamities of
Rome, (Appian. in Libycis, p. 136, edit. Toll.)]

[Footnote 5000: See Daniel, ii. 31-40. "And the fourth kingdom shall be
strong as iron; forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all
things." The remainder of the prophecy (the mixture of iron and clay)
was accomplished, according to St. Jerom, in his own time. Sicut enim
in principio nihil Romano Imperio fortius et durius, ita in fine rerum
nihil imbecillius; quum et in bellis civilibus et adversus diversas
nationes, aliarum gentium barbararum auxilio indigemus, (Opera, tom. v.
p. 572.)]

The rise of a city, which swelled into an empire, may deserve, as a
singular prodigy, the reflection of a philosophic mind. But the decline
of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness.
Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction
multiplied with the extent of conquest; and as soon as time or accident
had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to
the pressure of its own weight. The story of its ruin is simple and
obvious; and instead of inquiring why the Roman empire was destroyed, we
should rather be surprised that it had subsisted so long. The victorious
legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and
mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards
violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their
personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient
of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to
their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigor of the military government
was relaxed, and finally dissolved, by the partial institutions
of Constantine; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of
Barbarians.

The decay of Rome has been frequently ascribed to the translation of the
seat of empire; but this History has already shown, that the powers
of government were divided, rather than removed. The throne of
Constantinople was erected in the East; while the West was still
possessed by a series of emperors who held their residence in Italy,
and claimed their equal inheritance of the legions and provinces. This
dangerous novelty impaired the strength, and fomented the vices, of a
double reign: the instruments of an oppressive and arbitrary system were
multiplied; and a vain emulation of luxury, not of merit, was introduced
and supported between the degenerate successors of Theodosius. Extreme
distress, which unites the virtue of a free people, imbitters the
factions of a declining monarchy. The hostile favorites of Arcadius and
Honorius betrayed the republic to its common enemies; and the Byzantine
court beheld with indifference, perhaps with pleasure, the disgrace
of Rome, the misfortunes of Italy, and the loss of the West. Under the
succeeding reigns, the alliance of the two empires was restored; but the
aid of the Oriental Romans was tardy, doubtful, and ineffectual; and the
national schism of the Greeks and Latins was enlarged by the perpetual
difference of language and manners, of interests, and even of religion.
Yet the salutary event approved in some measure the judgment of
Constantine. During a long period of decay, his impregnable city
repelled the victorious armies of Barbarians, protected the wealth of
Asia, and commanded, both in peace and war, the important straits
which connect the Euxine and Mediterranean Seas. The foundation of
Constantinople more essentially contributed to the preservation of the
East, than to the ruin of the West.

As the happiness of a future life is the great object of religion, we
may hear without surprise or scandal, that the introduction or at least
the abuse, of Christianity had some influence on the decline and fall
of the Roman empire. The clergy successfully preached the doctrines
of patience and pusillanimity: the active virtues of society were
discouraged; and the last remains of military spirit were buried in the
cloister: a large portion of public and private wealth was consecrated
to the specious demands of charity and devotion; and the soldiers' pay
was lavished on the useless multitudes of both sexes, who could
only plead the merits of abstinence and chastity. [511] Faith, zeal,
curiosity, and the more earthly passions of malice and ambition, kindled
the flame of theological discord; the church, and even the state, were
distracted by religious factions, whose conflicts were sometimes bloody,
and always implacable; the attention of the emperors was diverted from
camps to synods; the Roman world was oppressed by a new species of
tyranny; and the persecuted sects became the secret enemies of their
country. Yet party spirit, however pernicious or absurd, is a principle
of union as well as of dissension. The bishops, from eighteen hundred
pulpits, inculcated the duty of passive obedience to a lawful
and orthodox sovereign; their frequent assemblies, and perpetual
correspondence, maintained the communion of distant churches; and the
benevolent temper of the gospel was strengthened, though confined, by
the spiritual alliance of the Catholics. The sacred indolence of the
monks was devoutly embraced by a servile and effeminate age; but if
superstition had not afforded a decent retreat, the same vices would
have tempted the unworthy Romans to desert, from baser motives, the
standard of the republic. Religious precepts are easily obeyed, which
indulge and sanctify the natural inclinations of their votaries; but
the pure and genuine influence of Christianity may be traced in its
beneficial, though imperfect, effects on the Barbarian proselytes of the
North. If the decline of the Roman empire was hastened by the conversion
of Constantine, his victorious religion broke the violence of the fall,
and mollified the ferocious temper of the conquerors.

[Footnote 511: It might be a curious speculation, how far the purer
morals of the genuine and more active Christians may have compensated,
in the population of the Roman empire, for the secession of such numbers
into inactive and unproductive celibacy.--M.]

This awful revolution may be usefully applied to the instruction of
the present age. It is the duty of a patriot to prefer and promote the
exclusive interest and glory of his native country: but a philosmay
be permitted to enlarge his views, and to consider Europe as one great
republic whose various inhabitants have obtained almost the same level
of politeness and cultivation. The balance of power will continue to
fluctuate, and the prosperity of our own, or the neighboring kingdoms,
may be alternately exalted or depressed; but these partial events cannot
essentially injure our general state of happiness, the system of arts,
and laws, and manners, which so advantageously distinguish, above the
rest of mankind, the Europeans and their colonies. The savage nations
of the globe are the common enemies of civilized society; and we may
inquire, with anxious curiosity, whether Europe is still threatened with
a repetition of those calamities, which formerly oppressed the arms and
institutions of Rome. Perhaps the same reflections will illustrate
the fall of that mighty empire, and explain the probable causes of our
actual security.

I. The Romans were ignorant of the extent of their danger, and the
number of their enemies. Beyond the Rhine and Danube, the Northern
countries of Europe and Asia were filled with innumerable tribes of
hunters and shepherds, poor, voracious, and turbulent; bold in arms,
and impatient to ravish the fruits of industry. The Barbarian world was
agitated by the rapid impulse of war; and the peace of Gaul or Italy was
shaken by the distant revolutions of China. The Huns, who fled before a
victorious enemy, directed their march towards the West; and the torrent
was swelled by the gradual accession of captives and allies. The flying
tribes who yielded to the Huns assumed in their turn the spirit of
conquest; the endless column of Barbarians pressed on the Roman empire
with accumulated weight; and, if the foremost were destroyed, the vacant
space was instantly replenished by new assailants. Such formidable
emigrations can no longer issue from the North; and the long repose,
which has been imputed to the decrease of population, is the happy
consequence of the progress of arts and agriculture. Instead of some
rude villages, thinly scattered among its woods and morasses, Germany
now produces a list of two thousand three hundred walled towns:
the Christian kingdoms of Denmark, Sweden, and Poland, have been
successively established; and the Hanse merchants, with the Teutonic
knights, have extended their colonies along the coast of the Baltic,
as far as the Gulf of Finland. From the Gulf of Finland to the Eastern
Ocean, Russia now assumes the form of a powerful and civilized empire.
The plough, the loom, and the forge, are introduced on the banks of the
Volga, the Oby, and the Lena; and the fiercest of the Tartar hordes have
been taught to tremble and obey. The reign of independent Barbarism is
now contracted to a narrow span; and the remnant of Calmucks or Uzbecks,
whose forces may be almost numbered, cannot seriously excite the
apprehensions of the great republic of Europe. [6000] Yet this apparent
security should not tempt us to forget, that new enemies, and unknown
dangers, may possibly arise from some obscure people, scarcely visible
in the map of the world, The Arabs or Saracens, who spread their
conquests from India to Spain, had languished in poverty and contempt,
till Mahomet breathed into those savage bodies the soul of enthusiasm.

[Footnote 6000: The French and English editors of the Genealogical History
of the Tartars have subjoined a curious, though imperfect, description,
of their present state. We might question the independence of the
Calmucks, or Eluths, since they have been recently vanquished by
the Chinese, who, in the year 1759, subdued the Lesser Bucharia, and
advanced into the country of Badakshan, near the source of the Oxus,
(Memoires sur les Chinois, tom. i. p. 325-400.) But these conquests
are precarious, nor will I venture to insure the safety of the Chinese
empire.]

II. The empire of Rome was firmly established by the singular and
perfect coalition of its members. The subject nations, resigning the
hope, and even the wish, of independence, embraced the character of
Roman citizens; and the provinces of the West were reluctantly torn
by the Barbarians from the bosom of their mother country. [7000] But this
union was purchased by the loss of national freedom and military spirit;
and the servile provinces, destitute of life and motion, expected their
safety from the mercenary troops and governors, who were directed by the
orders of a distant court. The happiness of a hundred millions depended
on the personal merit of one or two men, perhaps children, whose minds
were corrupted by education, luxury, and despotic power. The deepest
wounds were inflicted on the empire during the minorities of the sons
and grandsons of Theodosius; and, after those incapable princes seemed
to attain the age of manhood, they abandoned the church to the bishops,
the state to the eunuchs, and the provinces to the Barbarians. Europe
is now divided into twelve powerful, though unequal kingdoms, three
respectable commonwealths, and a variety of smaller, though independent,
states: the chances of royal and ministerial talents are multiplied, at
least, with the number of its rulers; and a Julian, or Semiramis, may
reign in the North, while Arcadius and Honorius again slumber on the
thrones of the South. The abuses of tyranny are restrained by the
mutual influence of fear and shame; republics have acquired order and
stability; monarchies have imbibed the principles of freedom, or, at
least, of moderation; and some sense of honor and justice is introduced
into the most defective constitutions by the general manners of the
times. In peace, the progress of knowledge and industry is accelerated
by the emulation of so many active rivals: in war, the European
forces are exercised by temperate and undecisive contests. If a savage
conqueror should issue from the deserts of Tartary, he must repeatedly
vanquish the robust peasants of Russia, the numerous armies of Germany,
the gallant nobles of France, and the intrepid freemen of Britain;
who, perhaps, might confederate for their common defence. Should
the victorious Barbarians carry slavery and desolation as far as the
Atlantic Ocean, ten thousand vessels would transport beyond their
pursuit the remains of civilized society; and Europe would revive
and flourish in the American world, which is already filled with her
colonies and institutions. [8000]

[Footnote 7000: The prudent reader will determine how far this general
proposition is weakened by the revolt of the Isaurians, the independence
of Britain and Armorica, the Moorish tribes, or the Bagaudae of Gaul and
Spain, (vol. i. p. 328, vol. iii. p. 315, vol. iii. p. 372, 480.)]

[Footnote 8000: America now contains about six millions of European blood
and descent; and their numbers, at least in the North, are continually
increasing. Whatever may be the changes of their political situation,
they must preserve the manners of Europe; and we may reflect with some
pleasure, that the English language will probably be diffused ever an
immense and populous continent.]

III. Cold, poverty, and a life of danger and fatigue, fortify the
strength and courage of Barbarians. In every age they have oppressed the
polite and peaceful nations of China, India, and Persia, who neglected,
and still neglect, to counterbalance these natural powers by the
resources of military art. The warlike states of antiquity, Greece,
Macedonia, and Rome, educated a race of soldiers; exercised their
bodies, disciplined their courage, multiplied their forces by regular
evolutions, and converted the iron, which they possessed, into strong
and serviceable weapons. But this superiority insensibly declined with
their laws and manners; and the feeble policy of Constantine and his
successors armed and instructed, for the ruin of the empire, the rude
valor of the Barbarian mercenaries. The military art has been changed
by the invention of gunpowder; which enables man to command the two
most powerful agents of nature, air and fire. Mathematics, chemistry,
mechanics, architecture, have been applied to the service of war; and
the adverse parties oppose to each other the most elaborate modes of
attack and of defence. Historians may indignantly observe, that the
preparations of a siege would found and maintain a flourishing colony;
[9000] yet we cannot be displeased, that the subversion of a city should be
a work of cost and difficulty; or that an industrious people should be
protected by those arts, which survive and supply the decay of military
virtue. Cannon and fortifications now form an impregnable barrier
against the Tartar horse; and Europe is secure from any future
irruptions of Barbarians; since, before they can conquer, they must
cease to be barbarous. Their gradual advances in the science of war
would always be accompanied, as we may learn from the example of Russia,
with a proportionable improvement in the arts of peace and civil policy;
and they themselves must deserve a place among the polished nations whom
they subdue.

[Footnote 9000: On avoit fait venir (for the siege of Turin) 140 pieces
de canon; et il est a remarquer que chaque gros canon monte revient
a environ ecus: il y avoit 100,000 boulets; 106,000 cartouches d'une
facon, et 300,000 d'une autre; 21,000 bombes; 27,700 grenades, 15,000
sacs a terre, 30,000 instruments pour la pionnage; 1,200,000 livres de
poudre. Ajoutez a ces munitions, le plomb, le fer, et le fer-blanc, les
cordages, tout ce qui sert aux mineurs, le souphre, le salpetre, les
outils de toute espece. Il est certain que les frais de tous ces
preparatifs de destruction suffiroient pour fonder et pour faire fleurir
la plus aombreuse colonie. Voltaire, Siecle de Louis XIV. c. xx. in his
Works. tom. xi. p. 391.]

Should these speculations be found doubtful or fallacious, there still
remains a more humble source of comfort and hope. The discoveries of
ancient and modern navigators, and the domestic history, or tradition,
of the most enlightened nations, represent the human savage, naked both
in body and mind and destitute of laws, of arts, of ideas, and almost
of language. [1001] From this abject condition, perhaps the primitive and
universal state of man, he has gradually arisen to command the animals,
to fertilize the earth, to traverse the ocean and to measure the
heavens. His progress in the improvement and exercise of his mental and
corporeal faculties [1101] has been irregular and various; infinitely slow
in the beginning, and increasing by degrees with redoubled velocity:
ages of laborious ascent have been followed by a moment of rapid
downfall; and the several climates of the globe have felt the
vicissitudes of light and darkness. Yet the experience of four thousand
years should enlarge our hopes, and diminish our apprehensions: we
cannot determine to what height the human species may aspire in their
advances towards perfection; but it may safely be presumed, that no
people, unless the face of nature is changed, will relapse into their
original barbarism. The improvements of society may be viewed under a
threefold aspect. 1. The poet or philosopher illustrates his age and
country by the efforts of a single mind; but those superior powers of
reason or fancy are rare and spontaneous productions; and the genius of
Homer, or Cicero, or Newton, would excite less admiration, if they could
be created by the will of a prince, or the lessons of a preceptor. 2.
The benefits of law and policy, of trade and manufactures, of arts and
sciences, are more solid and permanent: and many individuals may be
qualified, by education and discipline, to promote, in their respective
stations, the interest of the community. But this general order is the
effect of skill and labor; and the complex machinery may be decayed by
time, or injured by violence.

3. Fortunately for mankind, the more useful, or, at least, more
necessary arts, can be performed without superior talents, or national
subordination: without the powers of one, or the union of many. Each
village, each family, each individual, must always possess both ability
and inclination to perpetuate the use of fire [1201] and of metals; the
propagation and service of domestic animals; the methods of hunting and
fishing; the rudiments of navigation; the imperfect cultivation of
corn, or other nutritive grain; and the simple practice of the mechanic
trades. Private genius and public industry may be extirpated; but these
hardy plants survive the tempest, and strike an everlasting root into
the most unfavorable soil. The splendid days of Augustus and Trajan were
eclipsed by a cloud of ignorance; and the Barbarians subverted the laws
and palaces of Rome. But the scythe, the invention or emblem of Saturn,
[1301] still continued annually to mow the harvests of Italy; and the
human feasts of the Laestrigons [1401] have never been renewed on the
coast of Campania.

[Footnote 1001: It would be an easy, though tedious, task, to produce the
authorities of poets, philosophers, and historians. I shall therefore
content myself with appealing to the decisive and authentic testimony of
Diodorus Siculus, (tom. i. l. i. p. 11, 12, l. iii. p. 184, &c., edit.
Wesseling.) The Icthyophagi, who in his time wandered along the shores
of the Red Sea, can only be compared to the natives of New Holland,
(Dampier's Voyages, vol. i. p. 464-469.) Fancy, or perhaps reason, may
still suppose an extreme and absolute state of nature far below the
level of these savages, who had acquired some arts and instruments.]

[Footnote 1101: See the learned and rational work of the president Goguet,
de l'Origine des Loix, des Arts, et des Sciences. He traces from facts,
or conjectures, (tom. i. p. 147-337, edit. 12mo.,) the first and most
difficult steps of human invention.]

[Footnote 1201: It is certain, however strange, that many nations
have been ignorant of the use of fire. Even the ingenious natives of
Otaheite, who are destitute of metals, have not invented any earthen
vessels capable of sustaining the action of fire, and of communicating
the heat to the liquids which they contain.]

[Footnote 1301: Plutarch. Quaest. Rom. in tom. ii. p. 275. Macrob.
Saturnal. l. i. c. 8, p. 152, edit. London. The arrival of Saturn (of
his religious worship) in a ship, may indicate, that the savage coast of
Latium was first discovered and civilized by the Phoenicians.]

[Footnote 1401: In the ninth and tenth books of the Odyssey, Homer has
embellished the tales of fearful and credulous sailors, who transformed
the cannibals of Italy and Sicily into monstrous giants.]

Since the first discovery of the arts, war, commerce, and religious
zeal have diffused, among the savages of the Old and New World, these
inestimable gifts: they have been successively propagated; they can
never be lost. We may therefore acquiesce in the pleasing conclusion,
that every age of the world has increased, and still increases, the real
wealth, the happiness, the knowledge, and perhaps the virtue, of the
human race. [1501]

[Footnote 1501: The merit of discovery has too often been stained with
avarice, cruelty, and fanaticism; and the intercourse of nations
has produced the communication of disease and prejudice. A singular
exception is due to the virtue of our own times and country. The five
great voyages, successively undertaken by the command of his present
Majesty, were inspired by the pure and generous love of science and of
mankind. The same prince, adapting his benefactions to the different
stages of society, has founded his school of painting in his capital;
and has introduced into the islands of the South Sea the vegetables and
animals most useful to human life.]
