## Chapter XXII: Julian Declared Emperor.--Part III.

Philosophy had instructed Julian to compare the advantages of action
and retirement; but the elevation of his birth, and the accidents of
his life, never allowed him the freedom of choice. He might perhaps
sincerely have preferred the groves of the academy, and the society of
Athens; but he was constrained, at first by the will, and afterwards
by the injustice, of Constantius, to expose his person and fame to the
dangers of Imperial greatness; and to make himself accountable to the
world, and to posterity, for the happiness of millions. [46] Julian
recollected with terror the observation of his master Plato, [47] that
the government of our flocks and herds is always committed to beings
of a superior species; and that the conduct of nations requires and
deserves the celestial powers of the gods or of the genii. From this
principle he justly concluded, that the man who presumes to reign,
should aspire to the perfection of the divine nature; that he should
purify his soul from her mortal and terrestrial part; that he should
extinguish his appetites, enlighten his understanding, regulate his
passions, and subdue the wild beast, which, according to the lively
metaphor of Aristotle, [48] seldom fails to ascend the throne of a
despot. The throne of Julian, which the death of Constantius fixed on
an independent basis, was the seat of reason, of virtue, and perhaps of
vanity. He despised the honors, renounced the pleasures, and discharged
with incessant diligence the duties, of his exalted station; and there
were few among his subjects who would have consented to relieve him from
the weight of the diadem, had they been obliged to submit their time
and their actions to the rigorous laws which that philosophic emperor
imposed on himself. One of his most intimate friends, [49] who had often
shared the frugal simplicity of his table, has remarked, that his light
and sparing diet (which was usually of the vegetable kind) left his mind
and body always free and active, for the various and important business
of an author, a pontiff, a magistrate, a general, and a prince. In one
and the same day, he gave audience to several ambassadors, and wrote,
or dictated, a great number of letters to his generals, his civil
magistrates, his private friends, and the different cities of his
dominions. He listened to the memorials which had been received,
considered the subject of the petitions, and signified his intentions
more rapidly than they could be taken in short-hand by the diligence
of his secretaries. He possessed such flexibility of thought, and such
firmness of attention, that he could employ his hand to write, his ear
to listen, and his voice to dictate; and pursue at once three several
trains of ideas without hesitation, and without error. While his
ministers reposed, the prince flew with agility from one labor to
another, and, after a hasty dinner, retired into his library, till the
public business, which he had appointed for the evening, summoned him to
interrupt the prosecution of his studies. The supper of the emperor was
still less substantial than the former meal; his sleep was never clouded
by the fumes of indigestion; and except in the short interval of a
marriage, which was the effect of policy rather than love, the chaste
Julian never shared his bed with a female companion. [50] He was
soon awakened by the entrance of fresh secretaries, who had slept the
preceding day; and his servants were obliged to wait alternately
while their indefatigable master allowed himself scarcely any other
refreshment than the change of occupation. The predecessors of Julian,
his uncle, his brother, and his cousin, indulged their puerile taste for
the games of the Circus, under the specious pretence of complying
with the inclinations of the people; and they frequently remained
the greatest part of the day as idle spectators, and as a part of the
splendid spectacle, till the ordinary round of twenty-four races [51]
was completely finished. On solemn festivals, Julian, who felt and
professed an unfashionable dislike to these frivolous amusements,
condescended to appear in the Circus; and after bestowing a careless
glance at five or six of the races, he hastily withdrew with the
impatience of a philosopher, who considered every moment as lost that
was not devoted to the advantage of the public or the improvement of his
own mind. [52] By this avarice of time, he seemed to protract the short
duration of his reign; and if the dates were less securely ascertained,
we should refuse to believe, that only sixteen months elapsed between
the death of Constantius and the departure of his successor for the
Persian war. The actions of Julian can only be preserved by the care
of the historian; but the portion of his voluminous writings, which is
still extant, remains as a monument of the application, as well as of
the genius, of the emperor. The Misopogon, the Caesars, several of his
orations, and his elaborate work against the Christian religion, were
composed in the long nights of the two winters, the former of which he
passed at Constantinople, and the latter at Antioch.

[Footnote 46: Julian himself (p. 253-267) has expressed these
philosophical ideas with much eloquence and some affectation, in a very
elaborate epistle to Themistius. The Abbe de la Bleterie, (tom. ii. p.
146-193,) who has given an elegant translation, is inclined to believe
that it was the celebrated Themistius, whose orations are still extant.]

[Footnote 47: Julian. ad Themist. p. 258. Petavius (not. p. 95) observes
that this passage is taken from the fourth book De Legibus; but either
Julian quoted from memory, or his MSS. were different from ours Xenophon
opens the Cyropaedia with a similar reflection.]

[Footnote 48: Aristot. ap. Julian. p. 261. The MS. of Vossius,
unsatisfied with the single beast, affords the stronger reading of which
the experience of despotism may warrant.]

[Footnote 49: Libanius (Orat. Parentalis, c. lxxxiv. lxxxv. p. 310, 311,
312) has given this interesting detail of the private life of Julian. He
himself (in Misopogon, p. 350) mentions his vegetable diet, and upbraids
the gross and sensual appetite of the people of Antioch.]

[Footnote 50: Lectulus... Vestalium toris purior, is the praise which
Mamertinus (Panegyr. Vet. xi. 13) addresses to Julian himself. Libanius
affirms, in sober peremptory language, that Julian never knew a woman
before his marriage, or after the death of his wife, (Orat. Parent. c.
lxxxviii. p. 313.) The chastity of Julian is confirmed by the impartial
testimony of Ammianus, (xxv. 4,) and the partial silence of the
Christians. Yet Julian ironically urges the reproach of the people of
Antioch, that he almost always (in Misopogon, p. 345) lay alone. This
suspicious expression is explained by the Abbe de la Bleterie (Hist. de
Jovien, tom. ii. p. 103-109) with candor and ingenuity.]

[Footnote 51: See Salmasius ad Sueton in Claud. c. xxi. A twenty-fifth
race, or missus, was added, to complete the number of one hundred
chariots, four of which, the four colors, started each heat.

Centum quadrijugos agitabo ad flumina currus.

It appears, that they ran five or seven times round the Mota (Sueton in
Domitian. c. 4;) and (from the measure of the Circus Maximus at Rome,
the Hippodrome at Constantinople, &c.) it might be about a four mile
course.]

[Footnote 52: Julian. in Misopogon, p. 340. Julius Caesar had offended
the Roman people by reading his despatches during the actual race.
Augustus indulged their taste, or his own, by his constant attention to
the important business of the Circus, for which he professed the warmest
inclination. Sueton. in August. c. xlv.]

The reformation of the Imperial court was one of the first and most
necessary acts of the government of Julian. [53] Soon after his entrance
into the palace of Constantinople, he had occasion for the service of
a barber. An officer, magnificently dressed, immediately presented
himself. "It is a barber," exclaimed the prince, with affected surprise,
"that I want, and not a receiver-general of the finances." [54] He
questioned the man concerning the profits of his employment and was
informed, that besides a large salary, and some valuable perquisites,
he enjoyed a daily allowance for twenty servants, and as many horses.
A thousand barbers, a thousand cup-bearers, a thousand cooks, were
distributed in the several offices of luxury; and the number of eunuchs
could be compared only with the insects of a summer's day. The monarch
who resigned to his subjects the superiority of merit and virtue, was
distinguished by the oppressive magnificence of his dress, his table,
his buildings, and his train. The stately palaces erected by Constantine
and his sons, were decorated with many colored marbles, and ornaments of
massy gold. The most exquisite dainties were procured, to gratify their
pride, rather than their taste; birds of the most distant climates, fish
from the most remote seas, fruits out of their natural season, winter
roses, and summer snows. [56] The domestic crowd of the palace surpassed
the expense of the legions; yet the smallest part of this costly
multitude was subservient to the use, or even to the splendor, of the
throne. The monarch was disgraced, and the people was injured, by the
creation and sale of an infinite number of obscure, and even titular
employments; and the most worthless of mankind might purchase the
privilege of being maintained, without the necessity of labor, from the
public revenue. The waste of an enormous household, the increase of
fees and perquisites, which were soon claimed as a lawful debt, and
the bribes which they extorted from those who feared their enmity, or
solicited their favor, suddenly enriched these haughty menials. They
abused their fortune, without considering their past, or their future,
condition; and their rapine and venality could be equalled only by the
extravagance of their dissipations. Their silken robes were embroidered
with gold, their tables were served with delicacy and profusion; the
houses which they built for their own use, would have covered the farm
of an ancient consul; and the most honorable citizens were obliged to
dismount from their horses, and respectfully to salute a eunuch whom
they met on the public highway. The luxury of the palace excited the
contempt and indignation of Julian, who usually slept on the ground, who
yielded with reluctance to the indispensable calls of nature; and who
placed his vanity, not in emulating, but in despising, the pomp of
royalty.

[Footnote 53: The reformation of the palace is described by Ammianus,
(xxii. 4,) Libanius, Orat. (Parent. c. lxii. p. 288, &c.,) Mamertinus,
in Panegyr. (Vet. xi. 11,) Socrates, (l. iii. c. l.,) and Zonaras, (tom.
ii. l. xiii. p. 24.)]

[Footnote 54: Ego non rationalem jussi sed tonsorem acciri. Zonaras uses
the less natural image of a senator. Yet an officer of the finances,
who was satisfied with wealth, might desire and obtain the honors of the
senate.]

[Footnote 56: The expressions of Mamertinus are lively and forcible.
Quis etiam prandiorum et caenarum laboratas magnitudines Romanus
populus sensit; cum quaesitissimae dapes non gustu sed difficultatibus
aestimarentur; miracula avium, longinqui maris pisces, aheni temporis
poma, aestivae nives, hybernae rosae]

By the total extirpation of a mischief which was magnified even beyond
its real extent, he was impatient to relieve the distress, and to
appease the murmurs of the people; who support with less uneasiness the
weight of taxes, if they are convinced that the fruits of their industry
are appropriated to the service of the state. But in the execution of
this salutary work, Julian is accused of proceeding with too much haste
and inconsiderate severity. By a single edict, he reduced the palace
of Constantinople to an immense desert, and dismissed with ignominy the
whole train of slaves and dependants, [57] without providing any just,
or at least benevolent, exceptions, for the age, the services, or the
poverty, of the faithful domestics of the Imperial family. Such indeed
was the temper of Julian, who seldom recollected the fundamental maxim
of Aristotle, that true virtue is placed at an equal distance between
the opposite vices.

The splendid and effeminate dress of the Asiatics, the curls and paint,
the collars and bracelets, which had appeared so ridiculous in the
person of Constantine, were consistently rejected by his philosophic
successor. But with the fopperies, Julian affected to renounce the
decencies of dress; and seemed to value himself for his neglect of the
laws of cleanliness. In a satirical performance, which was designed for
the public eye, the emperor descants with pleasure, and even with
pride, on the length of his nails, and the inky blackness of his hands;
protests, that although the greatest part of his body was covered
with hair, the use of the razor was confined to his head alone; and
celebrates, with visible complacency, the shaggy and populous [58]
beard, which he fondly cherished, after the example of the philosophers
of Greece. Had Julian consulted the simple dictates of reason, the first
magistrate of the Romans would have scorned the affectation of Diogenes,
as well as that of Darius.

[Footnote 57: Yet Julian himself was accused of bestowing whole towns
on the eunuchs, (Orat. vii. against Polyclet. p. 117-127.) Libanius
contents himself with a cold but positive denial of the fact, which
seems indeed to belong more properly to Constantius. This charge,
however, may allude to some unknown circumstance.]

[Footnote 58: In the Misopogon (p. 338, 339) he draws a very
singular picture of himself, and the following words are strangely
characteristic. The friends of the Abbe de la Bleterie adjured him,
in the name of the French nation, not to translate this passage, so
offensive to their delicacy, (Hist. de Jovien, tom. ii. p. 94.) Like
him, I have contented myself with a transient allusion; but the little
animal which Julian names, is a beast familiar to man, and signifies
love.]

But the work of public reformation would have remained imperfect, if
Julian had only corrected the abuses, without punishing the crimes, of
his predecessor's reign. "We are now delivered," says he, in a familiar
letter to one of his intimate friends, "we are now surprisingly
delivered from the voracious jaws of the Hydra. [59] I do not mean to
apply the epithet to my brother Constantius. He is no more; may the
earth lie light on his head! But his artful and cruel favorites studied
to deceive and exasperate a prince, whose natural mildness cannot
be praised without some efforts of adulation. It is not, however, my
intention, that even those men should be oppressed: they are accused,
and they shall enjoy the benefit of a fair and impartial trial." To
conduct this inquiry, Julian named six judges of the highest rank in the
state and army; and as he wished to escape the reproach of condemning
his personal enemies, he fixed this extraordinary tribunal at
Chalcedon, on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus; and transferred to the
commissioners an absolute power to pronounce and execute their final
sentence, without delay, and without appeal. The office of president was
exercised by the venerable praefect of the East, a second Sallust, [60]
whose virtues conciliated the esteem of Greek sophists, and of Christian
bishops. He was assisted by the eloquent Mamertinus, [61] one of the
consuls elect, whose merit is loudly celebrated by the doubtful evidence
of his own applause. But the civil wisdom of two magistrates was
overbalanced by the ferocious violence of four generals, Nevitta, Agilo,
Jovinus, and Arbetio. Arbetio, whom the public would have seen with
less surprise at the bar than on the bench, was supposed to possess the
secret of the commission; the armed and angry leaders of the Jovian
and Herculian bands encompassed the tribunal; and the judges were
alternately swayed by the laws of justice, and by the clamors of
faction. [62]

[Footnote 59: Julian, epist. xxiii. p. 389. He uses the words in writing
to his friend Hermogenes, who, like himself, was conversant with the
Greek poets.]

[Footnote 60: The two Sallusts, the praefect of Gaul, and the praefect
of the East, must be carefully distinguished, (Hist. des Empereurs,
tom. iv. p. 696.) I have used the surname of Secundus, as a convenient
epithet. The second Sallust extorted the esteem of the Christians
themselves; and Gregory Nazianzen, who condemned his religion, has
celebrated his virtues, (Orat. iii. p. 90.) See a curious note of the
Abbe de la Bleterie, Vie de Julien, p. 363. Note: Gibbonus secundum
habet pro numero, quod tamen est viri agnomen Wagner, nota in loc. Amm.
It is not a mistake; it is rather an error in taste. Wagner inclines to
transfer the chief guilt to Arbetio.--M.]

[Footnote 61: Mamertinus praises the emperor (xi. l.) for bestowing
the offices of Treasurer and Praefect on a man of wisdom, firmness,
integrity, &c., like himself. Yet Ammianus ranks him (xxi. l.) among the
ministers of Julian, quorum merita norat et fidem.]

[Footnote 62: The proceedings of this chamber of justice are related by
Ammianus, (xxii. 3,) and praised by Libanius, (Orat. Parent. c. 74, p.
299, 300.)]

The chamberlain Eusebius, who had so long abused the favor of
Constantius, expiated, by an ignominious death, the insolence, the
corruption, and cruelty of his servile reign. The executions of Paul
and Apodemius (the former of whom was burnt alive) were accepted as
an inadequate atonement by the widows and orphans of so many hundred
Romans, whom those legal tyrants had betrayed and murdered. But justice
herself (if we may use the pathetic expression of Ammianus) [63] appeared
to weep over the fate of Ursulus, the treasurer of the empire; and
his blood accused the ingratitude of Julian, whose distress had been
seasonably relieved by the intrepid liberality of that honest minister.
The rage of the soldiers, whom he had provoked by his indiscretion, was
the cause and the excuse of his death; and the emperor, deeply wounded
by his own reproaches and those of the public, offered some consolation
to the family of Ursulus, by the restitution of his confiscated
fortunes. Before the end of the year in which they had been adorned with
the ensigns of the prefecture and consulship, [64] Taurus and Florentius
were reduced to implore the clemency of the inexorable tribunal of
Chalcedon. The former was banished to Vercellae in Italy, and a sentence
of death was pronounced against the latter. A wise prince should have
rewarded the crime of Taurus: the faithful minister, when he was no
longer able to oppose the progress of a rebel, had taken refuge in
the court of his benefactor and his lawful sovereign. But the guilt of
Florentius justified the severity of the judges; and his escape served
to display the magnanimity of Julian, who nobly checked the interested
diligence of an informer, and refused to learn what place concealed the
wretched fugitive from his just resentment. [65] Some months after the
tribunal of Chalcedon had been dissolved, the praetorian vicegerent of
Africa, the notary Gaudentius, and Artemius [66] duke of Egypt, were
executed at Antioch. Artemius had reigned the cruel and corrupt tyrant
of a great province; Gaudentius had long practised the arts of calumny
against the innocent, the virtuous, and even the person of Julian
himself. Yet the circumstances of their trial and condemnation were
so unskillfully managed, that these wicked men obtained, in the public
opinion, the glory of suffering for the obstinate loyalty with which
they had supported the cause of Constantius. The rest of his servants
were protected by a general act of oblivion; and they were left to enjoy
with impunity the bribes which they had accepted, either to defend the
oppressed, or to oppress the friendless. This measure, which, on the
soundest principles of policy, may deserve our approbation, was executed
in a manner which seemed to degrade the majesty of the throne. Julian
was tormented by the importunities of a multitude, particularly of
Egyptians, who loudly redemanded the gifts which they had imprudently
or illegally bestowed; he foresaw the endless prosecution of vexatious
suits; and he engaged a promise, which ought always to have been sacred,
that if they would repair to Chalcedon, he would meet them in person, to
hear and determine their complaints. But as soon as they were landed,
he issued an absolute order, which prohibited the watermen from
transporting any Egyptian to Constantinople; and thus detained his
disappointed clients on the Asiatic shore till, their patience and money
being utterly exhausted, they were obliged to return with indignant
murmurs to their native country. [67]

[Footnote 63: Ursuli vero necem ipsa mihi videtur flesse justitia.
Libanius, who imputes his death to the soldiers, attempts to criminate
the court of the largesses.]

[Footnote 64: Such respect was still entertained for the venerable names
of the commonwealth, that the public was surprised and scandalized to
hear Taurus summoned as a criminal under the consulship of Taurus.
The summons of his colleague Florentius was probably delayed till the
commencement of the ensuing year.]

[Footnote 65: Ammian. xx. 7.]

[Footnote 66: For the guilt and punishment of Artemius, see Julian
(Epist. x. p. 379) and Ammianus, (xxii. 6, and Vales, ad hoc.) The
merit of Artemius, who demolished temples, and was put to death by an
apostate, has tempted the Greek and Latin churches to honor him as a
martyr. But as ecclesiastical history attests that he was not only
a tyrant, but an Arian, it is not altogether easy to justify this
indiscreet promotion. Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom. vii. p. 1319.]

Theodosianus, l. ii. tit. xxxix. leg. i.; and Godefroy's Commentary,
