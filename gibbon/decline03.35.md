## Chapter XXXVI: Total Extinction Of The Western Empire.--Part II.

The pressing solicitations of the senate and people persuaded the
emperor Avitus to fix his residence at Rome, and to accept the
consulship for the ensuing year. On the first day of January, his
son-in-law, Sidonius Apollinaris, celebrated his praises in a panegyric
of six hundred verses; but this composition, though it was rewarded with
a brass statue, [24] seems to contain a very moderate proportion, either
of genius or of truth. The poet, if we may degrade that sacred name,
exaggerates the merit of a sovereign and a father; and his prophecy of a
long and glorious reign was soon contradicted by the event. Avitus, at a
time when the Imperial dignity was reduced to a preeminence of toil and
danger, indulged himself in the pleasures of Italian luxury: age had not
extinguished his amorous inclinations; and he is accused of insulting,
with indiscreet and ungenerous raillery, the husbands whose wives he
had seduced or violated. [25] But the Romans were not inclined either
to excuse his faults or to acknowledge his virtues. The several parts
of the empire became every day more alienated from each other; and the
stranger of Gaul was the object of popular hatred and contempt. The
senate asserted their legitimate claim in the election of an emperor;
and their authority, which had been originally derived from the old
constitution, was again fortified by the actual weakness of a declining
monarchy. Yet even such a monarchy might have resisted the votes of an
unarmed senate, if their discontent had not been supported, or perhaps
inflamed, by the Count Ricimer, one of the principal commanders of the
Barbarian troops, who formed the military defence of Italy. The daughter
of Wallia, king of the Visigoths, was the mother of Ricimer; but he was
descended, on the father's side, from the nation of the Suevi; [26]
his pride or patriotism might be exasperated by the misfortunes of
his countrymen; and he obeyed, with reluctance, an emperor in whose
elevation he had not been consulted. His faithful and important services
against the common enemy rendered him still more formidable; [27] and,
after destroying on the coast of Corsica a fleet of Vandals, which
consisted of sixty galleys, Ricimer returned in triumph with the
appellation of the Deliverer of Italy. He chose that moment to signify
to Avitus, that his reign was at an end; and the feeble emperor, at
a distance from his Gothic allies, was compelled, after a short and
unavailing struggle to abdicate the purple. By the clemency, however,
or the contempt, of Ricimer, [28] he was permitted to descend from the
throne to the more desirable station of bishop of Placentia: but the
resentment of the senate was still unsatisfied; and their inflexible
severity pronounced the sentence of his death He fled towards the Alps,
with the humble hope, not of arming the Visigoths in his cause, but of
securing his person and treasures in the sanctuary of Julian, one of
the tutelar saints of Auvergne. [29] Disease, or the hand of the
executioner, arrested him on the road; yet his remains were decently
transported to Brivas, or Brioude, in his native province, and he
reposed at the feet of his holy patron. [30] Avitus left only one
daughter, the wife of Sidonius Apollinaris, who inherited the patrimony
of his father-in-law; lamenting, at the same time, the disappointment
of his public and private expectations. His resentment prompted him to
join, or at least to countenance, the measures of a rebellious faction
in Gaul; and the poet had contracted some guilt, which it was incumbent
on him to expiate, by a new tribute of flattery to the succeeding
emperor. [31]

[Footnote 25: Luxuriose agere volens a senatoribus projectus est, is the
concise expression of Gregory of Tours, (l. ii. c. xi. in tom. ii. p.

Avitus, which seems more applicable to Rome than to Treves.]

birth of Ricimer, the lawful heir, as he chooses to insinuate, both of
the Gothic and Suevic kingdoms.]

[Footnote 28: Parcens innocentiae Aviti, is the compassionate, but
contemptuous, language of Victor Tunnunensis, (in Chron. apud Scaliger
Euseb.) In another place, he calls him, vir totius simplicitatis. This
commendation is more humble, but it is more solid and sincere, than the
praises of Sidonius]

[Footnote 29: He suffered, as it is supposed, in the persecution of
Diocletian, (Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom. v. p. 279, 696.) Gregory of
Tours, his peculiar votary, has dedicated to the glory of Julian the
Martyr an entire book, (de Gloria Martyrum, l. ii. in Max. Bibliot.
Patrum, tom. xi. p. 861-871,) in which he relates about fifty foolish
miracles performed by his relics.]

[Footnote 30: Gregory of Tours (l. ii. c. xi. p. 168) is concise, but
correct, in the reign of his countryman. The words of Idatius, "cadet
imperio, caret et vita," seem to imply, that the death of Avitus was
violent; but it must have been secret, since Evagrius (l. ii. c. 7)
could suppose, that he died of the plaque.]

[Footnote 31: After a modest appeal to the examples of his brethren,
Virgil and Horace, Sidonius honestly confesses the debt, and promises
payment.

     Sic mihi diverso nuper sub Marte cadenti
     Jussisti placido Victor ut essem animo.
     Serviat ergo tibi servati lingua poetae,
     Atque meae vitae laus tua sit pretium.
     --Sidon. Apoll. Carm. iv. p. 308

See Dubos, Hist. Critique, tom. i. p. 448, &c.]

The successor of Avitus presents the welcome discovery of a great and
heroic character, such as sometimes arise, in a degenerate age, to
vindicate the honor of the human species. The emperor Majorian has
deserved the praises of his contemporaries, and of posterity; and
these praises may be strongly expressed in the words of a judicious and
disinterested historian: "That he was gentle to his subjects; that he
was terrible to his enemies; and that he excelled, in every virtue, all
his predecessors who had reigned over the Romans." [32] Such a testimony
may justify at least the panegyric of S donius; and we may acquiesce
in the assurance, that, although the obsequious orator would have
flattered, with equal zeal, the most worthless of princes, the
extraordinary merit of his object confined him, on this occasion, within
the bounds of truth. [33] Majorian derived his name from his maternal
grandfather, who, in the reign of the great Theodosius, had commanded
the troops of the Illyrian frontier. He gave his daughter in marriage
to the father of Majorian, a respectable officer, who administered the
revenues of Gaul with skill and integrity; and generously preferred the
friendship of Aetius to the tempting offer of an insidious court. His
son, the future emperor, who was educated in the profession of arms,
displayed, from his early youth, intrepid courage, premature wisdom, and
unbounded liberality in a scanty fortune. He followed the standard of
Aetius, contributed to his success, shared, and sometimes eclipsed, his
glory, and at last excited the jealousy of the patrician, or rather
of his wife, who forced him to retire from the service. [34] Majorian,
after the death of Aetius, was recalled and promoted; and his intimate
connection with Count Ricimer was the immediate step by which he
ascended the throne of the Western empire. During the vacancy that
succeeded the abdication of Avitus, the ambitious Barbarian, whose birth
excluded him from the Imperial dignity, governed Italy with the title
of Patrician; resigned to his friend the conspicuous station of
master-general of the cavalry and infantry; and, after an interval of
some months, consented to the unanimous wish of the Romans, whose favor
Majorian had solicited by a recent victory over the Alemanni. [35]
He was invested with the purple at Ravenna: and the epistle which
he addressed to the senate, will best describe his situation and his
sentiments. "Your election, Conscript Fathers! and the ordinance of the
most valiant army, have made me your emperor. [36] May the propitious
Deity direct and prosper the counsels and events of my administration,
to your advantage and to the public welfare! For my own part, I did
not aspire, I have submitted to reign; nor should I have discharged
the obligations of a citizen if I had refused, with base and selfish
ingratitude, to support the weight of those labors, which were imposed
by the republic. Assist, therefore, the prince whom you have made;
partake the duties which you have enjoined; and may our common endeavors
promote the happiness of an empire, which I have accepted from your
hands. Be assured, that, in our times, justice shall resume her ancient
vigor, and that virtue shall become, not only innocent, but meritorious.
Let none, except the authors themselves, be apprehensive of delations,
[37] which, as a subject, I have always condemned, and, as a prince,
will severely punish. Our own vigilance, and that of our father, the
patrician Ricimer, shall regulate all military affairs, and provide
for the safety of the Roman world, which we have saved from foreign and
domestic enemies. [38] You now understand the maxims of my government;
you may confide in the faithful love and sincere assurances of a prince
who has formerly been the companion of your life and dangers; who still
glories in the name of senator, and who is anxious that you should
never repent the judgment which you have pronounced in his favor." The
emperor, who, amidst the ruins of the Roman world, revived the ancient
language of law and liberty, which Trajan would not have disclaimed,
must have derived those generous sentiments from his own heart; since
they were not suggested to his imitation by the customs of his age, or
the example of his predecessors. [39]

[Footnote 32: The words of Procopius deserve to be transcribed (de Bell.
Vandal. l. i. c. 7, p. 194;) a concise but comprehensive definition of
royal virtue.]

[Footnote 33: The Panegyric was pronounced at Lyons before the end of
the year 458, while the emperor was still consul. It has more art than
genius, and more labor than art. The ornaments are false and trivial;
the expression is feeble and prolix; and Sidonius wants the skill to
exhibit the principal figure in a strong and distinct light. The private
life of Majorian occupies about two hundred lines, 107-305.]

[Footnote 34: She pressed his immediate death, and was scarcely
satisfied with his disgrace. It should seem that Aetius, like Belisarius
and Marlborough, was governed by his wife; whose fervent piety, though
it might work miracles, (Gregor. Turon. l. ii. c. 7, p. 162,) was not
incompatible with base and sanguinary counsels.]

[Footnote 35: The Alemanni had passed the Rhaetian Alps, and were
defeated in the Campi Canini, or Valley of Bellinzone, through which
the Tesin flows, in its descent from Mount Adula to the Lago Maggiore,
(Cluver Italia Antiq. tom. i. p. 100, 101.) This boasted victory over
nine hundred Barbarians (Panegyr. Majorian. 373, &c.) betrays the
extreme weakness of Italy.]

[Footnote 36: Imperatorem me factum, P.C. electionis vestrae arbitrio,
et fortissimi exercitus ordinatione agnoscite, (Novell. Majorian. tit.
iii. p. 34, ad Calcem. Cod. Theodos.) Sidonius proclaims the unanimous
voice of the empire:--

     Postquam ordine vobis
     Ordo omnis regnum dederat; plebs, curia, nules,
    ---Et collega simul. 386.

This language is ancient and constitutional; and we may observe, that
the clergy were not yet considered as a distinct order of the state.]

[Footnote 37: Either dilationes, or delationes would afford a tolerable
reading, but there is much more sense and spirit in the latter, to which
I have therefore given the preference.]

[Footnote 38: Ab externo hoste et a domestica clade liberavimus: by the
latter, Majorian must understand the tyranny of Avitus; whose death he
consequently avowed as a meritorious act. On this occasion, Sidonius
is fearful and obscure; he describes the twelve Caesars, the nations of
Africa, &c., that he may escape the dangerous name of Avitus (805-369.)]

[Footnote 39: See the whole edict or epistle of Majorian to the senate,
(Novell. tit. iv. p. 34.) Yet the expression, regnum nostrum, bears
some taint of the age, and does not mix kindly with the word respublica,
which he frequently repeats.]

The private and public actions of Majorian are very imperfectly known:
but his laws, remarkable for an original cast of thought and expression,
faithfully represent the character of a sovereign who loved his people,
who sympathized in their distress, who had studied the causes of the
decline of the empire, and who was capable of applying (as far as such
reformation was practicable) judicious and effectual remedies to
the public disorders. [40] His regulations concerning the finances
manifestly tended to remove, or at least to mitigate, the most
intolerable grievances. I. From the first hour of his reign, he was
solicitous (I translate his own words) to relieve the weary fortunes of
the provincials, oppressed by the accumulated weight of indictions and
superindictions. [41] With this view he granted a universal amnesty, a
final and absolute discharge of all arrears of tribute, of all debts,
which, under any pretence, the fiscal officers might demand from the
people. This wise dereliction of obsolete, vexatious, and unprofitable
claims, improved and purified the sources of the public revenue; and the
subject who could now look back without despair, might labor with hope
and gratitude for himself and for his country. II. In the assessment and
collection of taxes, Majorian restored the ordinary jurisdiction of the
provincial magistrates; and suppressed the extraordinary commissions
which had been introduced, in the name of the emperor himself, or of the
Praetorian praefects. The favorite servants, who obtained such irregular
powers, were insolent in their behavior, and arbitrary in their demands:
they affected to despise the subordinate tribunals, and they were
discontented, if their fees and profits did not twice exceed the sum
which they condescended to pay into the treasury. One instance of their
extortion would appear incredible, were it not authenticated by the
legislator himself. They exacted the whole payment in gold: but they
refused the current coin of the empire, and would accept only such
ancient pieces as were stamped with the names of Faustina or the
Antonines. The subject, who was unprovided with these curious medals,
had recourse to the expedient of compounding with their rapacious
demands; or if he succeeded in the research, his imposition was doubled,
according to the weight and value of the money of former times. [42]
III. "The municipal corporations, (says the emperor,) the lesser
senates, (so antiquity has justly styled them,) deserve to be considered
as the heart of the cities, and the sinews of the republic. And yet
so low are they now reduced, by the injustice of magistrates and the
venality of collectors, that many of their members, renouncing their
dignity and their country, have taken refuge in distant and obscure
exile." He urges, and even compels, their return to their respective
cities; but he removes the grievance which had forced them to desert
the exercise of their municipal functions. They are directed, under
the authority of the provincial magistrates, to resume their office
of levying the tribute; but, instead of being made responsible for the
whole sum assessed on their district, they are only required to produce
a regular account of the payments which they have actually received, and
of the defaulters who are still indebted to the public. IV. But Majorian
was not ignorant that these corporate bodies were too much inclined to
retaliate the injustice and oppression which they had suffered; and
he therefore revives the useful office of the defenders of cities. He
exhorts the people to elect, in a full and free assembly, some man of
discretion and integrity, who would dare to assert their privileges, to
represent their grievances, to protect the poor from the tyranny of the
rich, and to inform the emperor of the abuses that were committed under
the sanction of his name and authority.

[Footnote 40: See the laws of Majorian (they are only nine in number,
but very long, and various) at the end of the Theodosian Code, Novell.
l. iv. p. 32-37. Godefroy has not given any commentary on these
additional pieces.]

[Footnote 41: Fessas provincialium varia atque multiplici tributorum
exactione fortunas, et extraordinariis fiscalium solutionum oneribus
attritas, &c. Novell. Majorian. tit. iv. p. 34.]

[Footnote 42: The learned Greaves (vol. i. p. 329, 330, 331) has found,
by a diligent inquiry, that aurei of the Antonines weighed one hundred
and eighteen, and those of the fifth century only sixty-eight, English
grains. Majorian gives currency to all gold coin, excepting only the
Gallic solidus, from its deficiency, not in the weight, but in the
standard.] The spectator who casts a mournful view over the ruins of
ancient Rome, is tempted to accuse the memory of the Goths and Vandals,
for the mischief which they had neither leisure, nor power, nor perhaps
inclination, to perpetrate. The tempest of war might strike some
lofty turrets to the ground; but the destruction which undermined the
foundations of those massy fabrics was prosecuted, slowly and silently,
during a period of ten centuries; and the motives of interest, that
afterwards operated without shame or control, were severely checked by
the taste and spirit of the emperor Majorian. The decay of the city
had gradually impaired the value of the public works. The circus and
theatres might still excite, but they seldom gratified, the desires of
the people: the temples, which had escaped the zeal of the Christians,
were no longer inhabited, either by gods or men; the diminished
crowds of the Romans were lost in the immense space of their baths and
porticos; and the stately libraries and halls of justice became useless
to an indolent generation, whose repose was seldom disturbed, either
by study or business. The monuments of consular, or Imperial, greatness
were no longer revered, as the immortal glory of the capital: they were
only esteemed as an inexhaustible mine of materials, cheaper, and more
convenient than the distant quarry. Specious petitions were continually
addressed to the easy magistrates of Rome, which stated the want of
stones or bricks, for some necessary service: the fairest forms of
architecture were rudely defaced, for the sake of some paltry, or
pretended, repairs; and the degenerate Romans, who converted the spoil
to their own emolument, demolished, with sacrilegious hands, the labors
of their ancestors. Majorian, who had often sighed over the desolation
of the city, applied a severe remedy to the growing evil. [43] He
reserved to the prince and senate the sole cognizance of the extreme
cases which might justify the destruction of an ancient edifice; imposed
a fine of fifty pounds of gold (two thousand pounds sterling) on every
magistrate who should presume to grant such illegal and scandalous
license, and threatened to chastise the criminal obedience of their
subordinate officers, by a severe whipping, and the amputation of both
their hands. In the last instance, the legislator might seem to forget
the proportion of guilt and punishment; but his zeal arose from a
generous principle, and Majorian was anxious to protect the monuments
of those ages, in which he would have desired and deserved to live. The
emperor conceived, that it was his interest to increase the number
of his subjects; and that it was his duty to guard the purity of the
marriage-bed: but the means which he employed to accomplish these
salutary purposes are of an ambiguous, and perhaps exceptionable,
kind. The pious maids, who consecrated their virginity to Christ, were
restrained from taking the veil till they had reached their fortieth
year. Widows under that age were compelled to form a second alliance
within the term of five years, by the forfeiture of half their wealth
to their nearest relations, or to the state. Unequal marriages were
condemned or annulled. The punishment of confiscation and exile was
deemed so inadequate to the guilt of adultery, that, if the criminal
returned to Italy, he might, by the express declaration of Majorian, be
slain with impunity. [44]

[Footnote 43: The whole edict (Novell. Majorian. tit. vi. p. 35) is
curious. "Antiquarum aedium dissipatur speciosa constructio; et ut
aliquid reparetur, magna diruuntur. Hinc jam occasio nascitur, ut etiam
unusquisque privatum aedificium construens, per gratiam judicum.....
praesumere de publicis locis necessaria, et transferre non dubitet"
&c. With equal zeal, but with less power, Petrarch, in the fourteenth
century, repeated the same complaints. (Vie de Petrarque, tom. i. p.
326, 327.) If I prosecute this history, I shall not be unmindful of the
decline and fall of the city of Rome; an interesting object to which any
plan was originally confined.]

[Footnote 44: The emperor chides the lenity of Rogatian, consular of
Tuscany in a style of acrimonious reproof, which sounds almost like
personal resentment, (Novell. tit. ix. p. 47.) The law of Majorian,
which punished obstinate widows, was soon afterwards repealed by his
successor Severus, (Novell. Sever. tit. i. p. 37.)]

While the emperor Majorian assiduously labored to restore the happiness
and virtue of the Romans, he encountered the arms of Genseric, from his
character and situation their most formidable enemy. A fleet of Vandals
and Moors landed at the mouth of the Liris, or Garigliano; but the
Imperial troops surprised and attacked the disorderly Barbarians, who
were encumbered with the spoils of Campania; they were chased with
slaughter to their ships, and their leader, the king's brother-in-law,
was found in the number of the slain. [45] Such vigilance might announce
the character of the new reign; but the strictest vigilance, and the
most numerous forces, were insufficient to protect the long-extended
coast of Italy from the depredations of a naval war. The public opinion
had imposed a nobler and more arduous task on the genius of Majorian.
Rome expected from him alone the restitution of Africa; and the design,
which he formed, of attacking the Vandals in their new settlements, was
the result of bold and judicious policy. If the intrepid emperor could
have infused his own spirit into the youth of Italy; if he could have
revived in the field of Mars, the manly exercises in which he had always
surpassed his equals; he might have marched against Genseric at the
head of a Roman army. Such a reformation of national manners might be
embraced by the rising generation; but it is the misfortune of those
princes who laboriously sustain a declining monarchy, that, to obtain
some immediate advantage, or to avert some impending danger, they are
forced to countenance, and even to multiply, the most pernicious abuses.
Majorian, like the weakest of his predecessors, was reduced to the
disgraceful expedient of substituting Barbarian auxiliaries in the place
of his unwarlike subjects: and his superior abilities could only be
displayed in the vigor and dexterity with which he wielded a dangerous
instrument, so apt to recoil on the hand that used it. Besides the
confederates, who were already engaged in the service of the empire, the
fame of his liberality and valor attracted the nations of the Danube,
the Borysthenes, and perhaps of the Tanais. Many thousands of the
bravest subjects of Attila, the Gepidae, the Ostrogoths, the Rugians,
the Burgundians, the Suevi, the Alani, assembled in the plains of
Liguria; and their formidable strength was balanced by their mutual
animosities. [46] They passed the Alps in a severe winter. The emperor
led the way, on foot, and in complete armor; sounding, with his long
staff, the depth of the ice, or snow, and encouraging the Scythians,
who complained of the extreme cold, by the cheerful assurance, that they
should be satisfied with the heat of Africa. The citizens of Lyons had
presumed to shut their gates; they soon implored, and experienced, the
clemency of Majorian. He vanquished Theodoric in the field; and admitted
to his friendship and alliance a king whom he had found not unworthy of
his arms. The beneficial, though precarious, reunion of the greater part
of Gaul and Spain, was the effect of persuasion, as well as of force;
[47] and the independent Bagaudae, who had escaped, or resisted, the
oppression, of former reigns, were disposed to confide in the virtues
of Majorian. His camp was filled with Barbarian allies; his throne was
supported by the zeal of an affectionate people; but the emperor had
foreseen, that it was impossible, without a maritime power, to achieve
the conquest of Africa. In the first Punic war, the republic had exerted
such incredible diligence, that, within sixty days after the first
stroke of the axe had been given in the forest, a fleet of one hundred
and sixty galleys proudly rode at anchor in the sea. [48] Under
circumstances much less favorable, Majorian equalled the spirit and
perseverance of the ancient Romans. The woods of the Apennine were
felled; the arsenals and manufactures of Ravenna and Misenum were
restored; Italy and Gaul vied with each other in liberal contributions
to the public service; and the Imperial navy of three hundred large
galleys, with an adequate proportion of transports and smaller vessels,
was collected in the secure and capacious harbor of Carthagena in Spain.
[49] The intrepid countenance of Majorian animated his troops with a
confidence of victory; and, if we might credit the historian Procopius,
his courage sometimes hurried him beyond the bounds of prudence. Anxious
to explore, with his own eyes, the state of the Vandals, he ventured,
after disguising the color of his hair, to visit Carthage, in the
character of his own ambassador: and Genseric was afterwards mortified
by the discovery, that he had entertained and dismissed the emperor of
the Romans. Such an anecdote may be rejected as an improbable fiction;
but it is a fiction which would not have been imagined, unless in the
life of a hero. [50]

the most tolerable passages of the Panegyric, (470-552.) M. de Buat

commentator, than either Savaron or Sirmond.]

[Footnote 47: It is the just and forcible distinction of Priscus,
(Excerpt. Legat. p. 42,) in a short fragment, which throws much light
on the history of Majorian. Jornandes has suppressed the defeat and
alliance of the Visigoths, which were solemnly proclaimed in Gallicia;
and are marked in the Chronicle of Idatius.]
