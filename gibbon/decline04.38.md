## Chapter XLVII: Ecclesiastical Discord.--Part II.

The prize was not unworthy of his ambition. At a distance from the
court, and at the head of an immense capital, the patriarch, as he was
now styled, of Alexandria had gradually usurped the state and authority
of a civil magistrate. The public and private charities of the city were
blindly obeyed by his numerous and fanatic parabolani, [24] familiarized
in their daily office with scenes of death; and the praefects of Egypt
were awed or provoked by the temporal power of these Christian pontiffs.
Ardent in the prosecution of heresy, Cyril auspiciously opened his
reign by oppressing the Novatians, the most innocent and harmless of the
sectaries. The interdiction of their religious worship appeared in his
eyes a just and meritorious act; and he confiscated their holy vessels,
without apprehending the guilt of sacrilege. The toleration, and even
the privileges of the Jews, who had multiplied to the number of forty
thousand, were secured by the laws of the Caesars and Ptolemies, and
a long prescription of seven hundred years since the foundation of
Alexandria. Without any legal sentence, without any royal mandate, the
patriarch, at the dawn of day, led a seditious multitude to the attack
of the synagogues. Unarmed and unprepared, the Jews were incapable of
resistance; their houses of prayer were levelled with the ground, and
the episcopal warrior, after-rewarding his troops with the plunder
of their goods, expelled from the city the remnant of the unbelieving
nation. Perhaps he might plead the insolence of their prosperity, and
their deadly hatred of the Christians, whose blood they had recently
shed in a malicious or accidental tumult.

Such crimes would have deserved the animadversion of the magistrate;
but in this promiscuous outrage, the innocent were confounded with the
guilty, and Alexandria was impoverished by the loss of a wealthy and
industrious colony. The zeal of Cyril exposed him to the penalties of
the Julian law; but in a feeble government and a superstitious age, he
was secure of impunity, and even of praise. Orestes complained; but
his just complaints were too quickly forgotten by the ministers of
Theodosius, and too deeply remembered by a priest who affected to
pardon, and continued to hate, the praefect of Egypt. As he passed
through the streets, his chariot was assaulted by a band of five hundred
of the Nitrian monks his guards fled from the wild beasts of the desert;
his protestations that he was a Christian and a Catholic were answered
by a volley of stones, and the face of Orestes was covered with blood.
The loyal citizens of Alexandria hastened to his rescue; he instantly
satisfied his justice and revenge against the monk by whose hand he had
been wounded, and Ammonius expired under the rod of the lictor. At the
command of Cyril his body was raised from the ground, and transported,
in solemn procession, to the cathedral; the name of Ammonius was changed
to that of Thaumasius the wonderful; his tomb was decorated with
the trophies of martyrdom, and the patriarch ascended the pulpit to
celebrate the magnanimity of an assassin and a rebel. Such honors might
incite the faithful to combat and die under the banners of the saint;
and he soon prompted, or accepted, the sacrifice of a virgin, who
professed the religion of the Greeks, and cultivated the friendship
of Orestes. Hypatia, the daughter of Theon the mathematician, [25] was
initiated in her father's studies; her learned comments have elucidated
the geometry of Apollonius and Diophantus, and she publicly taught, both
at Athens and Alexandria, the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle. In the
bloom of beauty, and in the maturity of wisdom, the modest maid refused
her lovers and instructed her disciples; the persons most illustrious
for their rank or merit were impatient to visit the female philosopher;
and Cyril beheld, with a jealous eye, the gorgeous train of horses and
slaves who crowded the door of her academy. A rumor was spread among
the Christians, that the daughter of Theon was the only obstacle to the
reconciliation of the praefect and the archbishop; and that obstacle was
speedily removed. On a fatal day, in the holy season of Lent, Hypatia
was torn from her chariot, stripped naked, dragged to the church, and
inhumanly butchered by the hands of Peter the reader, and a troop of
savage and merciless fanatics: her flesh was scraped from her bones with
sharp cyster shells, [26] and her quivering limbs were delivered to
the flames. The just progress of inquiry and punishment was stopped by
seasonable gifts; but the murder of Hypatia has imprinted an indelible
stain on the character and religion of Cyril of Alexandria. [27]

[Footnote 24: The Parabolani of Alexandria were a charitable
corporation, instituted during the plague of Gallienus, to visit the
sick and to bury the dead. They gradually enlarged, abused, and sold the
privileges of their order. Their outrageous conduct during the reign of
Cyril provoked the emperor to deprive the patriarch of their nomination,
and to restrain their number to five or six hundred. But these
restraints were transient and ineffectual. See the Theodosian Code, l.
xvi. tit. ii. and Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom. xiv. p. 276--278.]

[Footnote 25: For Theon and his daughter Hypatia. see Fabricius,
Bibliothec. tom. viii. p. 210, 211. Her article in the Lexicon of Suidas
is curious and original. Hesychius (Meursii Opera, tom. vii. p. 295,
296) observes, that he was persecuted; and an epigram in the Greek
Anthology (l. i. c. 76, p. 159, edit. Brodaei) celebrates her knowledge
and eloquence. She is honorably mentioned (Epist. 10, 15 16, 33--80,
124, 135, 153) by her friend and disciple the philosophic bishop
Synesius.]

[Footnote 26: Oyster shells were plentifully strewed on the sea-beach
before the Caesareum. I may therefore prefer the literal sense, without
rejecting the metaphorical version of tegulae, tiles, which is used
by M. de Valois ignorant, and the assassins were probably regardless,
whether their victim was yet alive.]

[Footnote 27: These exploits of St. Cyril are recorded by Socrates, (l.
vii. c. 13, 14, 15;) and the most reluctant bigotry is compelled to copy
an historian who coolly styles the murderers of Hypatia. At the mention
of that injured name, I am pleased to observe a blush even on the cheek
of Baronius, (A.D. 415, No. 48.)]

Superstition, perhaps, would more gently expiate the blood of a virgin,
than the banishment of a saint; and Cyril had accompanied his uncle
to the iniquitous synod of the Oak. When the memory of Chrysostom was
restored and consecrated, the nephew of Theophilus, at the head of a
dying faction, still maintained the justice of his sentence; nor was it
till after a tedious delay and an obstinate resistance, that he yielded
to the consent of the Catholic world. [28] His enmity to the Byzantine
pontiffs [29] was a sense of interest, not a sally of passion: he envied
their fortunate station in the sunshine of the Imperial court; and he
dreaded their upstart ambition. which oppressed the metropolitans of
Europe and Asia, invaded the provinces of Antioch and Alexandria, and
measured their diocese by the limits of the empire. The long moderation
of Atticus, the mild usurper of the throne of Chrysostom, suspended the
animosities of the Eastern patriarchs; but Cyril was at length awakened
by the exaltation of a rival more worthy of his esteem and hatred. After
the short and troubled reign of Sisinnius, bishop of Constantinople,
the factions of the clergy and people were appeased by the choice of the
emperor, who, on this occasion, consulted the voice of fame, and invited
the merit of a stranger.

Nestorius, [30] native of Germanicia, and a monk of Antioch, was
recommended by the austerity of his life, and the eloquence of his
sermons; but the first homily which he preached before the devout
Theodosius betrayed the acrimony and impatience of his zeal. "Give me, O
Caesar!" he exclaimed, "give me the earth purged of heretics, and I
will give you in exchange the kingdom of heaven. Exterminate with me the
heretics; and with you I will exterminate the Persians." On the
fifth day as if the treaty had been already signed, the patriarch of
Constantinople discovered, surprised, and attacked a secret conventicle
of the Arians: they preferred death to submission; the flames that were
kindled by their despair, soon spread to the neighboring houses, and the
triumph of Nestorius was clouded by the name of incendiary. On either
side of the Hellespont his episcopal vigor imposed a rigid formulary of
faith and discipline; a chronological error concerning the festival of
Easter was punished as an offence against the church and state. Lydia
and Caria, Sardes and Miletus, were purified with the blood of the
obstinate Quartodecimans; and the edict of the emperor, or rather of the
patriarch, enumerates three-and-twenty degrees and denominations in the
guilt and punishment of heresy. [31] But the sword of persecution which
Nestorius so furiously wielded was soon turned against his own breast.
Religion was the pretence; but, in the judgment of a contemporary saint,
ambition was the genuine motive of episcopal warfare. [32]

[Footnote 28: He was deaf to the entreaties of Atticus of
Constantinople, and of Isidore of Pelusium, and yielded only (if we may
believe Nicephorus, l. xiv. c. 18) to the personal intercession of the
Virgin. Yet in his last years he still muttered that John Chrysostom had
been justly condemned, (Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom. xiv. p. 278--282.
Baronius Annal. Eccles. A.D. 412, No. 46--64.)]

[Footnote 29: See their characters in the history of Socrates, (l. vii.
c. 25--28;) their power and pretensions, in the huge compilation of
Thomassin, (Discipline de l'Eglise, tom. i. p. 80-91.)]

[Footnote 30: His elevation and conduct are described by Socrates, (l.
vii. c. 29 31;) and Marcellinus seems to have applied the eloquentiae
satis, sapi entiae parum, of Sallust.]

[Footnote 31: Cod. Theodos. l. xvi. tit. v. leg. 65, with the
illustrations of Baronius, (A.D. 428, No. 25, &c.,) Godefroy, (ad
locum,) and Pagi, Critica, (tom. ii. p. 208.)]

[Footnote 32: Isidore of Pelusium, (l. iv. Epist. 57.) His words are
strong and scandalous. Isidore is a saint, but he never became a bishop;
and I half suspect that the pride of Diogenes trampled on the pride of
Plato.]

In the Syrian school, Nestorius had been taught to abhor the confusion
of the two natures, and nicely to discriminate the humanity of his
master Christ from the divinity of the Lord Jesus. [33] The Blessed
Virgin he revered as the mother of Christ, but his ears were offended
with the rash and recent title of mother of God, [34] which had been
insensibly adopted since the origin of the Arian controversy. From the
pulpit of Constantinople, a friend of the patriarch, and afterwards the
patriarch himself, repeatedly preached against the use, or the abuse,
of a word [35] unknown to the apostles, unauthorized by the church, and
which could only tend to alarm the timorous, to mislead the simple, to
amuse the profane, and to justify, by a seeming resemblance, the old
genealogy of Olympus. [36] In his calmer moments Nestorius confessed,
that it might be tolerated or excused by the union of the two natures,
and the communication of their idioms: [37] but he was exasperated, by
contradiction, to disclaim the worship of a new-born, an infant Deity,
to draw his inadequate similes from the conjugal or civil partnerships
of life, and to describe the manhood of Christ as the robe, the
instrument, the tabernacle of his Godhead. At these blasphemous sounds,
the pillars of the sanctuary were shaken. The unsuccessful competitors
of Nestorius indulged their pious or personal resentment, the Byzantine
clergy was secretly displeased with the intrusion of a stranger:
whatever is superstitious or absurd, might claim the protection of
the monks; and the people were interested in the glory of their virgin
patroness. [38] The sermons of the archbishop, and the service of the
altar, were disturbed by seditious clamor; his authority and doctrine
were renounced by separate congregations; every wind scattered round the
empire the leaves of controversy; and the voice of the combatants on a
sonorous theatre reechoed in the cells of Palestine and Egypt. It was
the duty of Cyril to enlighten the zeal and ignorance of his innumerable
monks: in the school of Alexandria, he had imbibed and professed the
incarnation of one nature; and the successor of Athanasius consulted
his pride and ambition, when he rose in arms against another Arius, more
formidable and more guilty, on the second throne of the hierarchy. After
a short correspondence, in which the rival prelates disguised their
hatred in the hollow language of respect and charity, the patriarch of
Alexandria denounced to the prince and people, to the East and to the
West, the damnable errors of the Byzantine pontiff. From the East,
more especially from Antioch, he obtained the ambiguous counsels of
toleration and silence, which were addressed to both parties while they
favored the cause of Nestorius. But the Vatican received with open arms
the messengers of Egypt. The vanity of Celestine was flattered by the
appeal; and the partial version of a monk decided the faith of the pope,
who with his Latin clergy was ignorant of the language, the arts, and
the theology of the Greeks. At the head of an Italian synod, Celestine
weighed the merits of the cause, approved the creed of Cyril, condemned
the sentiments and person of Nestorius, degraded the heretic from his
episcopal dignity, allowed a respite of ten days for recantation and
penance, and delegated to his enemy the execution of this rash and
illegal sentence. But the patriarch of Alexandria, while he darted the
thunders of a god, exposed the errors and passions of a mortal; and his
twelve anathemas [39] still torture the orthodox slaves, who adore the
memory of a saint, without forfeiting their allegiance to the synod of
Chalcedon. These bold assertions are indelibly tinged with the colors
of the Apollinarian heresy; but the serious, and perhaps the sincere
professions of Nestorius have satisfied the wiser and less partial
theologians of the present times. [40]

[Footnote 33: La Croze (Christianisme des Indes, tom. i. p. 44-53.
Thesaurus Epistolicus, La Crozianus, tom. iii. p. 276--280) has detected
the use, which, in the ivth, vth, and vith centuries, discriminates the
school of Diodorus of Tarsus and his Nestorian disciples.]

[Footnote 34: Deipara; as in zoology we familiarly speak of oviparous
and viviparous animals. It is not easy to fix the invention of this
word, which La Croze (Christianisme des Indes, tom. i. p. 16) ascribes
to Eusebius of Caesarea and the Arians. The orthodox testimonies are
produced by Cyril and Petavius, (Dogmat. Theolog. tom. v. l. v. c. 15,
p. 254, &c.;) but the veracity of the saint is questionable, and the
epithet so easily slides from the margin to the text of a Catholic Ms]

[Footnote 35: Basnage, in his Histoire de l'Eglise, a work of
controversy, (tom l. p. 505,) justifies the mother, by the blood, of
God, (Acts, xx. 28, with Mill's various readings.) But the Greek Mss.
are far from unanimous; and the primitive style of the blood of Christ
is preserved in the Syriac version, even in those copies which were
used by the Christians of St. Thomas on the coast of Malabar, (La Croze,
Christianisme des Indes, tom. i. p. 347.) The jealousy of the Nestorians
and Monophysites has guarded the purity of their text.]

[Footnote 36: The Pagans of Egypt already laughed at the new Cybele of
the Christians, (Isidor. l. i. epist. 54;) a letter was forged in the
name of Hypatia, to ridicule the theology of her assassin, (Synodicon,
c. 216, in iv. tom. Concil. p. 484.) In the article of Nestorius, Bayle
has scattered some loose philosophy on the worship of the Virgin Mary.]

[Footnote 37: The item of the Greeks, a mutual loan or transfer of the
idioms or properties of each nature to the other--of infinity to man,
passibility to God, &c. Twelve rules on this nicest of subjects compose
the Theological Grammar of Petavius, (Dogmata Theolog. tom. v. l. iv. c.
14, 15, p 209, &c.)]

[Footnote 38: See Ducange, C. P. Christiana, l. i. p. 30, &c.]

[Footnote 39: Concil. tom. iii. p. 943. They have never been directly
approved by the church, (Tillemont. Mem. Eccles. tom. xiv. p. 368--372.)
I almost pity the agony of rage and sophistry with which Petavius seems
to be agitated in the vith book of his Dogmata Theologica]

[Footnote 40: Such as the rational Basnage (ad tom. i. Variar. Lection.
Canisine in Praefat. c. 2, p. 11--23) and La Croze, the universal
scholar, (Christianisme des Indes, tom. i. p. 16--20. De l'Ethiopie, p.
26, 27. The saur. Epist. p. 176, &c., 283, 285.) His free sentence is
confirmed by that of his friends Jablonski (Thesaur. Epist. tom. i. p.
193--201) and Mosheim, (idem. p. 304, Nestorium crimine caruisse est
et mea sententia;) and three more respectable judges will not easily
be found. Asseman, a learned and modest slave, can hardly discern
(Bibliothec. Orient. tom. iv. p. 190--224) the guilt and error of the
Nestorians.]

Yet neither the emperor nor the primate of the East were disposed to
obey the mandate of an Italian priest; and a synod of the Catholic, or
rather of the Greek church, was unanimously demanded as the sole remedy
that could appease or decide this ecclesiastical quarrel. [41] Ephesus,
on all sides accessible by sea and land, was chosen for the place, the
festival of Pentecost for the day, of the meeting; a writ of summons was
despatched to each metropolitan, and a guard was stationed to protect
and confine the fathers till they should settle the mysteries of heaven,
and the faith of the earth. Nestorius appeared not as a criminal, but
as a judge; he depended on the weight rather than the number of his
prelates, and his sturdy slaves from the baths of Zeuxippus were armed
for every service of injury or defence. But his adversary Cyril was more
powerful in the weapons both of the flesh and of the spirit. Disobedient
to the letter, or at least to the meaning, of the royal summons, he was
attended by fifty Egyptian bishops, who expected from their patriarch's
nod the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. He had contracted an intimate
alliance with Memnon, bishop of Ephesus. The despotic primate of Asia
disposed of the ready succors of thirty or forty episcopal votes: a
crowd of peasants, the slaves of the church, was poured into the city to
support with blows and clamors a metaphysical argument; and the people
zealously asserted the honor of the Virgin, whose body reposed within
the walls of Ephesus. [42] The fleet which had transported Cyril from
Alexandria was laden with the riches of Egypt; and he disembarked a
numerous body of mariners, slaves, and fanatics, enlisted with blind
obedience under the banner of St. Mark and the mother of God. The
fathers, and even the guards, of the council were awed by this martial
array; the adversaries of Cyril and Mary were insulted in the streets,
or threatened in their houses; his eloquence and liberality made a daily
increase in the number of his adherents; and the Egyptian soon computed
that he might command the attendance and the voices of two hundred
bishops. [43] But the author of the twelve anathemas foresaw and dreaded
the opposition of John of Antioch, who, with a small, but respectable,
train of metropolitans and divines, was advancing by slow journeys
from the distant capital of the East. Impatient of a delay, which he
stigmatized as voluntary and culpable, [44] Cyril announced the opening
of the synod sixteen days after the festival of Pentecost. Nestorius,
who depended on the near approach of his Eastern friends, persisted,
like his predecessor Chrysostom, to disclaim the jurisdiction, and to
disobey the summons, of his enemies: they hastened his trial, and
his accuser presided in the seat of judgment. Sixty-eight bishops,
twenty-two of metropolitan rank, defended his cause by a modest and
temperate protest: they were excluded from the councils of their
brethren. Candidian, in the emperor's name, requested a delay of four
days; the profane magistrate was driven with outrage and insult from
the assembly of the saints. The whole of this momentous transaction was
crowded into the compass of a summer's day: the bishops delivered their
separate opinions; but the uniformity of style reveals the influence
or the hand of a master, who has been accused of corrupting the public
evidence of their acts and subscriptions. [45] Without a dissenting
voice, they recognized in the epistles of Cyril the Nicene creed and the
doctrine of the fathers: but the partial extracts from the letters and
homilies of Nestorius were interrupted by curses and anathemas: and the
heretic was degraded from his episcopal and ecclesiastical dignity.
The sentence, maliciously inscribed to the new Judas, was affixed and
proclaimed in the streets of Ephesus: the weary prelates, as they issued
from the church of the mother of God, were saluted as her champions;
and her victory was celebrated by the illuminations, the songs, and the
tumult of the night.

[Footnote 41: The origin and progress of the Nestorian controversy,
till the synod of Ephesus, may be found in Socrates, (l. vii. c. 32,)
Evagrius, (l. i. c. 1, 2,) Liberatus, (Brev. c. 1--4,) the original
Acts, (Concil. tom. iii. p. 551--991, edit. Venice, 1728,) the Annals
of Baronius and Pagi, and the faithful collections of Tillemont, (Mem.
Eccles. tom. xiv p. 283--377.)]

[Footnote 42: The Christians of the four first centuries were ignorant
of the death and burial of Mary. The tradition of Ephesus is affirmed
by the synod, (Concil. tom. iii. p. 1102;) yet it has been superseded by
the claim of Jerusalem; and her empty sepulchre, as it was shown to
the pilgrims, produced the fable of her resurrection and assumption, in
which the Greek and Latin churches have piously acquiesced. See Baronius
(Annal. Eccles. A.D. 48, No. 6, &c.) and Tillemont, (Mem. Eccles. tom.
i. p. 467--477.)]

[Footnote 43: The Acts of Chalcedon (Concil. tom. iv. p. 1405, 1408)
exhibit a lively picture of the blind, obstinate servitude of the
bishops of Egypt to their patriarch.]

[Footnote 44: Civil or ecclesiastical business detained the bishops
at Antioch till the 18th of May. Ephesus was at the distance of thirty
days' journey; and ten days more may be fairly allowed for accidents and
repose. The march of Xenophon over the same ground enumerates above 260
parasangs or leagues; and this measure might be illustrated from ancient
and modern itineraries, if I knew how to compare the speed of an army,
a synod, and a caravan. John of Antioch is reluctantly acquitted by
Tillemont himself, (Mem. Eccles. tom. xiv. p. 386--389.)]

[Footnote 45: Evagrius, l. i. c. 7. The same imputation was urged by
Count Irenaeus, (tom. iii. p. 1249;) and the orthodox critics do not
find it an easy task to defend the purity of the Greek or Latin copies
of the Acts.]

On the fifth day, the triumph was clouded by the arrival and indignation
of the Eastern bishops. In a chamber of the inn, before he had wiped
the dust from his shoes, John of Antioch gave audience to Candidian, the
Imperial minister; who related his ineffectual efforts to prevent or to
annul the hasty violence of the Egyptian. With equal haste and violence,
the Oriental synod of fifty bishops degraded Cyril and Memnon from their
episcopal honors, condemned, in the twelve anathemas, the purest venom
of the Apollinarian heresy, and described the Alexandrian primate as a
monster, born and educated for the destruction of the church. [46] His
throne was distant and inaccessible; but they instantly resolved to
bestow on the flock of Ephesus the blessing of a faithful shepherd.
By the vigilance of Memnon, the churches were shut against them, and
a strong garrison was thrown into the cathedral. The troops, under the
command of Candidian, advanced to the assault; the outguards were routed
and put to the sword, but the place was impregnable: the besiegers
retired; their retreat was pursued by a vigorous sally; they lost their
horses, and many of their soldiers were dangerously wounded with clubs
and stones. Ephesus, the city of the Virgin, was defiled with rage and
clamor, with sedition and blood; the rival synods darted anathemas
and excommunications from their spiritual engines; and the court of
Theodosius was perplexed by the adverse and contradictory narratives of
the Syrian and Egyptian factions. During a busy period of three months,
the emperor tried every method, except the most effectual means of
indifference and contempt, to reconcile this theological quarrel. He
attempted to remove or intimidate the leaders by a common sentence, of
acquittal or condemnation; he invested his representatives at Ephesus
with ample power and military force; he summoned from either party eight
chosen deputies to a free and candid conference in the neighborhood of
the capital, far from the contagion of popular frenzy. But the Orientals
refused to yield, and the Catholics, proud of their numbers and of their
Latin allies, rejected all terms of union or toleration. The patience
of the meek Theodosius was provoked; and he dissolved in anger this
episcopal tumult, which at the distance of thirteen centuries assumes
the venerable aspect of the third oecumenical council. [47] "God is
my witness," said the pious prince, "that I am not the author of this
confusion. His providence will discern and punish the guilty. Return
to your provinces, and may your private virtues repair the mischief and
scandal of your meeting." They returned to their provinces; but the same
passions which had distracted the synod of Ephesus were diffused over
the Eastern world. After three obstinate and equal campaigns, John of
Antioch and Cyril of Alexandria condescended to explain and embrace: but
their seeming reunion must be imputed rather to prudence than to reason,
to the mutual lassitude rather than to the Christian charity of the
patriarchs.

[Footnote 46: After the coalition of John and Cyril these invectives
were mutually forgotten. The style of declamation must never be
confounded with the genuine sense which respectable enemies entertain of
each other's merit, (Concil tom. iii. p. 1244.)]

[Footnote 47: See the acts of the synod of Ephesus in the original
Greek, and a Latin version almost contemporary, (Concil. tom. iii. p.
991--1339, with the Synodicon adversus Tragoediam Irenaei, tom. iv. p.
235--497,) the Ecclesiastical Histories of Socrates (l. vii. c. 34) and
Evagrius, (l i. c. 3, 4, 5,) and the Breviary of Liberatus, (in Concil.
tom. vi. p. 419--459, c. 5, 6,) and the Memoires Eccles. of Tillemont,
(tom. xiv p. 377-487.)]

The Byzantine pontiff had instilled into the royal ear a baleful
prejudice against the character and conduct of his Egyptian rival. An
epistle of menace and invective, [48] which accompanied the summons,
accused him as a busy, insolent, and envious priest, who perplexed the
simplicity of the faith, violated the peace of the church and state,
and, by his artful and separate addresses to the wife and sister of
Theodosius, presumed to suppose, or to scatter, the seeds of discord in
the Imperial family. At the stern command of his sovereign. Cyril had
repaired to Ephesus, where he was resisted, threatened, and confined,
by the magistrates in the interest of Nestorius and the Orientals; who
assembled the troops of Lydia and Ionia to suppress the fanatic and
disorderly train of the patriarch. Without expecting the royal license,
he escaped from his guards, precipitately embarked, deserted the
imperfect synod, and retired to his episcopal fortress of safety and
independence. But his artful emissaries, both in the court and city,
successfully labored to appease the resentment, and to conciliate the
favor, of the emperor. The feeble son of Arcadius was alternately
swayed by his wife and sister, by the eunuchs and women of the palace:
superstition and avarice were their ruling passions; and the orthodox
chiefs were assiduous in their endeavors to alarm the former, and to
gratify the latter. Constantinople and the suburbs were sanctified with
frequent monasteries, and the holy abbots, Dalmatius and Eutyches, [49]
had devoted their zeal and fidelity to the cause of Cyril, the worship
of Mary, and the unity of Christ. From the first moment of their
monastic life, they had never mingled with the world, or trod the
profane ground of the city. But in this awful moment of the danger of
the church, their vow was superseded by a more sublime and indispensable
duty. At the head of a long order of monks and hermits, who carried
burning tapers in their hands, and chanted litanies to the mother of
God, they proceeded from their monasteries to the palace. The people was
edified and inflamed by this extraordinary spectacle, and the trembling
monarch listened to the prayers and adjurations of the saints, who
boldly pronounced, that none could hope for salvation, unless they
embraced the person and the creed of the orthodox successor of
Athanasius. At the same time, every avenue of the throne was assaulted
with gold. Under the decent names of eulogies and benedictions, the
courtiers of both sexes were bribed according to the measure of their
power and rapaciousness. But their incessant demands despoiled the
sanctuaries of Constantinople and Alexandria; and the authority of the
patriarch was unable to silence the just murmur of his clergy, that a
debt of sixty thousand pounds had already been contracted to support the
expense of this scandalous corruption. [50] Pulcheria, who relieved
her brother from the weight of an empire, was the firmest pillar of
orthodoxy; and so intimate was the alliance between the thunders of the
synod and the whispers of the court, that Cyril was assured of success
if he could displace one eunuch, and substitute another in the favor of
Theodosius. Yet the Egyptian could not boast of a glorious or decisive
victory. The emperor, with unaccustomed firmness, adhered to his promise
of protecting the innocence of the Oriental bishops; and Cyril softened
his anathemas, and confessed, with ambiguity and reluctance, a twofold
nature of Christ, before he was permitted to satiate his revenge against
the unfortunate Nestorius. [51]

[Footnote 48: I should be curious to know how much Nestorius paid for
these expressions, so mortifying to his rival.]

[Footnote 49: Eutyches, the heresiarch Eutyches, is honorably named by
Cyril as a friend, a saint, and the strenuous defender of the faith. His
brother, the abbot Dalmatus, is likewise employed to bind the emperor
and all his chamberlains terribili conjuratione. Synodicon. c. 203, in
Concil. tom. iv p. 467.]

creature the new bishop of Constantinople, has been unaccountably
preserved in an old Latin version, (Synodicon, c. 203, Concil. tom.
iv. p. 465--468.) The mask is almost dropped, and the saints speak the
honest language of interest and confederacy.]

[Footnote 51: The tedious negotiations that succeeded the synod of
Ephesus are diffusely related in the original acts, (Concil. tom. iii.
p. 1339--1771, ad fin. vol. and the Synodicon, in tom. iv.,) Socrates,
(l. vii. c. 28, 35, 40, 41,) Evagrius, (l. i. c. 6, 7, 8, 12,)
Liberatus, (c. 7--10, 7-10,) Tillemont, (Mem. Eccles. tom. xiv. p.
487--676.) The most patient reader will thank me for compressing so much
nonsense and falsehood in a few lines.]

The rash and obstinate Nestorius, before the end of the synod, was
oppressed by Cyril, betrayed by the court, and faintly supported by his
Eastern friends. A sentiment or fear or indignation prompted him, while
it was yet time, to affect the glory of a voluntary abdication: [52]
his wish, or at least his request, was readily granted; he was conducted
with honor from Ephesus to his old monastery of Antioch; and, after a
short pause, his successors, Maximian and Proclus, were acknowledged as
the lawful bishops of Constantinople. But in the silence of his cell,
the degraded patriarch could no longer resume the innocence and security
of a private monk. The past he regretted, he was discontented with the
present, and the future he had reason to dread: the Oriental bishops
successively disengaged their cause from his unpopular name, and each
day decreased the number of the schismatics who revered Nestorius as the
confessor of the faith. After a residence at Antioch of four years, the
hand of Theodosius subscribed an edict, [53] which ranked him with
Simon the magician, proscribed his opinions and followers, condemned
his writings to the flames, and banished his person first to Petra, in
Arabia, and at length to Oasis, one of the islands of the Libyan desert.
[54] Secluded from the church and from the world, the exile was still
pursued by the rage of bigotry and war. A wandering tribe of the
Blemmyes or Nubians invaded his solitary prison: in their retreat they
dismissed a crowd of useless captives: but no sooner had Nestorius
reached the banks of the Nile, than he would gladly have escaped from
a Roman and orthodox city, to the milder servitude of the savages. His
flight was punished as a new crime: the soul of the patriarch inspired
the civil and ecclesiastical powers of Egypt; the magistrates, the
soldiers, the monks, devoutly tortured the enemy of Christ and St.
Cyril; and, as far as the confines of Aethiopia, the heretic was
alternately dragged and recalled, till his aged body was broken by the
hardships and accidents of these reiterated journeys. Yet his mind was
still independent and erect; the president of Thebais was awed by his
pastoral letters; he survived the Catholic tyrant of Alexandria, and,
after sixteen years' banishment, the synod of Chalcedon would perhaps
have restored him to the honors, or at least to the communion, of the
church. The death of Nestorius prevented his obedience to their welcome
summons; [55] and his disease might afford some color to the scandalous
report, that his tongue, the organ of blasphemy, had been eaten by the
worms. He was buried in a city of Upper Egypt, known by the names of
Chemnis, or Panopolis, or Akmim; [56] but the immortal malice of the
Jacobites has persevered for ages to cast stones against his sepulchre,
and to propagate the foolish tradition, that it was never watered by the
rain of heaven, which equally descends on the righteous and the ungodly.
[57] Humanity may drop a tear on the fate of Nestorius; yet justice
must observe, that he suffered the persecution which he had approved and
inflicted. [58]

[Footnote 52: Evagrius, l. i. c. 7. The original letters in the
Synodicon (c. 15, 24, 25, 26) justify the appearance of a voluntary
resignation, which is asserted by Ebed-Jesu, a Nestorian writer, apud
Asseman. Bibliot. Oriental. tom. iii. p. 299, 302.]

[Footnote 53: See the Imperial letters in the Acts of the Synod
of Ephesus, (Concil. tom. iii. p. 1730--1735.) The odious name of
Simonians, which was affixed to the disciples of this. Yet these were
Christians! who differed only in names and in shadows.]

[Footnote 54: The metaphor of islands is applied by the grave civilians
(Pandect. l. xlviii. tit. 22, leg. 7) to those happy spots which are
discriminated by water and verdure from the Libyan sands. Three of these
under the common name of Oasis, or Alvahat: 1. The temple of Jupiter
Ammon. 2. The middle Oasis, three days' journey to the west of
Lycopolis. 3. The southern, where Nestorius was banished in the first
climate, and only three days' journey from the confines of Nubia. See a
learned note of Michaelis, (ad Descript. Aegypt. Abulfedae, p. 21-34.)
* Note: 1. The Oasis of Sivah has been visited by Mons. Drovetti and
Mr. Browne. 2. The little Oasis, that of El Kassar, was visited and
described by Belzoni. 3. The great Oasis, and its splendid ruins, have
been well described in the travels of Sir A. Edmonstone. To these must
be added another Western Oasis also visited by Sir A. Edmonstone.--M.]

[Footnote 55: The invitation of Nestorius to the synod of Chalcedon,
is related by Zacharias, bishop of Melitene (Evagrius, l. ii. c. 2.
Asseman. Biblioth. Orient. tom. ii. p. 55,) and the famous Xenaias or
Philoxenus, bishop of Hierapolis, (Asseman. Bibliot. Orient. tom. ii. p.
40, &c.,) denied by Evagrius and Asseman, and stoutly maintained by
La Croze, (Thesaur. Epistol. tom. iii. p. 181, &c.) The fact is not
improbable; yet it was the interest of the Monophysites to spread the
invidious report, and Eutychius (tom. ii. p. 12) affirms, that Nestorius
died after an exile of seven years, and consequently ten years before
the synod of Chalcedon.]

(Description of the East, vol. i. p. 76,) Abulfeda, (Descript. Aegypt,
p. 14,) and his commentator Michaelis, (Not. p. 78--83,) and the Nubian
Geographer, (p. 42,) who mentions, in the xiith century, the ruins and
the sugar-canes of Akmim.]

[Footnote 57: Eutychius (Annal. tom. ii. p. 12) and Gregory
Bar-Hebraeus, of Abulpharagius, (Asseman, tom. ii. p. 316,) represent
the credulity of the xth and xiith centuries.]

[Footnote 58: We are obliged to Evagrius (l. i. c. 7) for some extracts
from the letters of Nestorius; but the lively picture of his sufferings
is treated with insult by the hard and stupid fanatic.]
