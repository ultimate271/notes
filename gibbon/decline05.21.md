## Chapter LI: Conquests By The Arabs.--Part VII.

On the intelligence of this rapid success, the applause of Musa
degenerated into envy; and he began, not to complain, but to fear, that
Tarik would leave him nothing to subdue. At the head of ten thousand
Arabs and eight thousand Africans, he passed over in person from
Mauritania to Spain: the first of his companions were the noblest of
the Koreish; his eldest son was left in the command of Africa; the
three younger brethren were of an age and spirit to second the boldest
enterprises of their father. At his landing in Algezire, he was
respectfully entertained by Count Julian, who stifled his inward
remorse, and testified, both in words and actions, that the victory of
the Arabs had not impaired his attachment to their cause. Some enemies
yet remained for the sword of Musa. The tardy repentance of the Goths
had compared their own numbers and those of the invaders; the cities
from which the march of Tarik had declined considered themselves as
impregnable; and the bravest patriots defended the fortifications of
Seville and Merida. They were successively besieged and reduced by the
labor of Musa, who transported his camp from the Boetis to the Anas,
from the Guadalquivir to the Guadiana. When he beheld the works of Roman
magnificence, the bridge, the aqueducts, the triumphal arches, and the
theatre, of the ancient metropolis of Lusitania, "I should imagine,"
said he to his four companions, "that the human race must have united
their art and power in the foundation of this city: happy is the man
who shall become its master!" He aspired to that happiness, but the
Emeritans sustained on this occasion the honor of their descent from
the veteran legionaries of Augustus [183] Disdaining the confinement
of their walls, they gave battle to the Arabs on the plain; but an
ambuscade rising from the shelter of a quarry, or a ruin, chastised
their indiscretion, and intercepted their return.

The wooden turrets of assault were rolled forwards to the foot of the
rampart; but the defence of Merida was obstinate and long; and the
castle of the martyrs was a perpetual testimony of the losses of the
Moslems. The constancy of the besieged was at length subdued by famine
and despair; and the prudent victor disguised his impatience under the
names of clemency and esteem. The alternative of exile or tribute was
allowed; the churches were divided between the two religions; and the
wealth of those who had fallen in the siege, or retired to Gallicia, was
confiscated as the reward of the faithful. In the midway between Merida
and Toledo, the lieutenant of Musa saluted the vicegerent of the
caliph, and conducted him to the palace of the Gothic kings. Their
first interview was cold and formal: a rigid account was exacted of the
treasures of Spain: the character of Tarik was exposed to suspicion
and obloquy; and the hero was imprisoned, reviled, and ignominiously
scourged by the hand, or the command, of Musa. Yet so strict was the
discipline, so pure the zeal, or so tame the spirit, of the primitive
Moslems, that, after this public indignity, Tarik could serve and
be trusted in the reduction of the Tarragonest province. A mosch was
erected at Saragossa, by the liberality of the Koreish: the port of
Barcelona was opened to the vessels of Syria; and the Goths were pursued
beyond the Pyrenaean mountains into their Gallic province of Septimania
or Languedoc. [184] In the church of St. Mary at Carcassone, Musa found,
but it is improbable that he left, seven equestrian statues of massy
silver; and from his term or column of Narbonne, he returned on his
footsteps to the Gallician and Lusitanian shores of the ocean. During
the absence of the father, his son Abdelaziz chastised the insurgents
of Seville, and reduced, from Malaga to Valentia, the sea-coast of
the Mediterranean: his original treaty with the discreet and valiant
Theodemir [185] will represent the manners and policy of the times. "The
conditions of peace agreed and sworn between Abdelaziz, the son of Musa,
the son of Nassir, and Theodemir prince of the Goths. In the name of
the most merciful God, Abdelaziz makes peace on these conditions: that
Theodemir shall not be disturbed in his principality; nor any injury be
offered to the life or property, the wives and children, the religion
and temples, of the Christians: that Theodemir shall freely deliver
his seven [1851] cities, Orihuela, Valentola, Alicanti Mola, Vacasora,
Bigerra, (now Bejar,) Ora, (or Opta,) and Lorca: that he shall not
assist or entertain the enemies of the caliph, but shall faithfully
communicate his knowledge of their hostile designs: that himself, and
each of the Gothic nobles, shall annually pay one piece of gold, four
measures of wheat, as many of barley, with a certain proportion of
honey, oil, and vinegar; and that each of their vassals shall be taxed
at one moiety of the said imposition. Given the fourth of Regeb, in the
year of the Hegira ninety-four, and subscribed with the names of four
Mussulman witnesses." [186] Theodemir and his subjects were treated with
uncommon lenity; but the rate of tribute appears to have fluctuated
from a tenth to a fifth, according to the submission or obstinacy of
the Christians. [187] In this revolution, many partial calamities were
inflicted by the carnal or religious passions of the enthusiasts: some
churches were profaned by the new worship: some relics or images were
confounded with idols: the rebels were put to the sword; and one
town (an obscure place between Cordova and Seville) was razed to its
foundations. Yet if we compare the invasion of Spain by the Goths, or
its recovery by the kings of Castile and Arragon, we must applaud the
moderation and discipline of the Arabian conquerors.

[Footnote 183: The honorable relics of the Cantabrian war (Dion Cassius,
l. liii p. 720) were planted in this metropolis of Lusitania, perhaps of
Spain, (submittit cui tota suos Hispania fasces.) Nonius (Hispania, c.
31, p. 106-110) enumerates the ancient structures, but concludes with
a sigh: Urbs haec olim nobilissima ad magnam incolarum infrequentiam
delapsa est, et praeter priscae claritatis ruinas nihil ostendit.]

[Footnote 184: Both the interpreters of Novairi, De Guignes (Hist. des
Huns, tom. i. p. 349) and Cardonne, (Hist. de l'Afrique et de l'Espagne,
tom. i. p. 93, 94, 104, 135,) lead Musa into the Narbonnese Gaul. But I
find no mention of this enterprise, either in Roderic of Toledo, or the
Mss. of the Escurial, and the invasion of the Saracens is postponed by
a French chronicle till the ixth year after the conquest of Spain, A.D.
721, (Pagi, Critica, tom. iii. p. 177, 195. Historians of France, tom.
iii.) I much question whether Musa ever passed the Pyrenees.]

[Footnote 185: Four hundred years after Theodemir, his territories of
Murcia and Carthagena retain in the Nubian geographer Edrisi (p, 154,
161) the name of Tadmir, (D'Anville, Etats de l'Europe, p. 156. Pagi,
tom. iii. p. 174.) In the present decay of Spanish agriculture, Mr.
Swinburne (Travels into Spain, p. 119) surveyed with pleasure the
delicious valley from Murcia to Orihuela, four leagues and a half of the
finest corn pulse, lucerne, oranges, &c.]

[Footnote 1851: Gibbon has made eight cities: in Conde's translation
Bigera does not appear.--M.]

[Footnote 186: See the treaty in Arabic and Latin, in the Bibliotheca
Arabico-Hispana, tom. ii. p. 105, 106. It is signed the 4th of the month
of Regeb, A. H. 94, the 5th of April, A.D. 713; a date which seems to
prolong the resistance of Theodemir, and the government of Musa.]

[Footnote 187: From the history of Sandoval, p. 87. Fleury (Hist.
Eccles. tom. ix. p. 261) has given the substance of another treaty
concluded A Ae. C. 782, A.D. 734, between an Arabian chief and the Goths
and Romans, of the territory of Conimbra in Portugal. The tax of the
churches is fixed at twenty-five pounds of gold; of the monasteries,
fifty; of the cathedrals, one hundred; the Christians are judged by
their count, but in capital cases he must consult the alcaide. The
church doors must be shut, and they must respect the name of Mahomet.
I have not the original before me; it would confirm or destroy a dark
suspicion, that the piece has been forged to introduce the immunity of a
neighboring convent.]

The exploits of Musa were performed in the evening of life, though he
affected to disguise his age by coloring with a red powder the whiteness
of his beard. But in the love of action and glory, his breast was
still fired with the ardor of youth; and the possession of Spain was
considered only as the first step to the monarchy of Europe. With
a powerful armament by sea and land, he was preparing to repass the
Pyrenees, to extinguish in Gaul and Italy the declining kingdoms of the
Franks and Lombards, and to preach the unity of God on the altar of the
Vatican. From thence, subduing the Barbarians of Germany, he proposed
to follow the course of the Danube from its source to the Euxine Sea,
to overthrow the Greek or Roman empire of Constantinople, and returning
from Europe to Asia, to unite his new acquisitions with Antioch and
the provinces of Syria. [188] But his vast enterprise, perhaps of
easy execution, must have seemed extravagant to vulgar minds; and the
visionary conqueror was soon reminded of his dependence and servitude.
The friends of Tarik had effectually stated his services and wrongs:
at the court of Damascus, the proceedings of Musa were blamed, his
intentions were suspected, and his delay in complying with the first
invitation was chastised by a harsher and more peremptory summons. An
intrepid messenger of the caliph entered his camp at Lugo in Gallicia,
and in the presence of the Saracens and Christians arrested the bridle
of his horse. His own loyalty, or that of his troops, inculcated the
duty of obedience: and his disgrace was alleviated by the recall of his
rival, and the permission of investing with his two governments his two
sons, Abdallah and Abdelaziz. His long triumph from Ceuta to Damascus
displayed the spoils of Africa and the treasures of Spain: four hundred
Gothic nobles, with gold coronets and girdles, were distinguished in his
train; and the number of male and female captives, selected for their
birth or beauty, was computed at eighteen, or even at thirty, thousand
persons. As soon as he reached Tiberias in Palestine, he was apprised
of the sickness and danger of the caliph, by a private message from
Soliman, his brother and presumptive heir; who wished to reserve for his
own reign the spectacle of victory.

Had Walid recovered, the delay of Musa would have been criminal: he
pursued his march, and found an enemy on the throne. In his trial before
a partial judge against a popular antagonist, he was convicted of vanity
and falsehood; and a fine of two hundred thousand pieces of gold
either exhausted his poverty or proved his rapaciousness. The unworthy
treatment of Tarik was revenged by a similar indignity; and the veteran
commander, after a public whipping, stood a whole day in the sun before
the palace gate, till he obtained a decent exile, under the pious name
of a pilgrimage to Mecca. The resentment of the caliph might have been
satiated with the ruin of Musa; but his fears demanded the extirpation
of a potent and injured family. A sentence of death was intimated with
secrecy and speed to the trusty servants of the throne both in Africa
and Spain; and the forms, if not the substance, of justice were
superseded in this bloody execution. In the mosch or palace of Cordova,
Abdelaziz was slain by the swords of the conspirators; they accused
their governor of claiming the honors of royalty; and his scandalous
marriage with Egilona, the widow of Roderic, offended the prejudices
both of the Christians and Moslems. By a refinement of cruelty, the
head of the son was presented to the father, with an insulting
question, whether he acknowledged the features of the rebel? "I know his
features," he exclaimed with indignation: "I assert his innocence; and
I imprecate the same, a juster fate, against the authors of his death."
The age and despair of Musa raised him above the power of kings; and he
expired at Mecca of the anguish of a broken heart. His rival was more
favorably treated: his services were forgiven; and Tarik was permitted
to mingle with the crowd of slaves. [189] I am ignorant whether Count
Julian was rewarded with the death which he deserved indeed, though not
from the hands of the Saracens; but the tale of their ingratitude to the
sons of Witiza is disproved by the most unquestionable evidence. The two
royal youths were reinstated in the private patrimony of their father;
but on the decease of Eba, the elder, his daughter was unjustly
despoiled of her portion by the violence of her uncle Sigebut. The
Gothic maid pleaded her cause before the caliph Hashem, and obtained the
restitution of her inheritance; but she was given in marriage to a noble
Arabian, and their two sons, Isaac and Ibrahim, were received in Spain
with the consideration that was due to their origin and riches.

[Footnote 188: This design, which is attested by several Arabian
historians, (Cardonne, tom. i. p. 95, 96,) may be compared with that of
Mithridates, to march from the Crimaea to Rome; or with that of Caesar,
to conquer the East, and return home by the North; and all three are
perhaps surpassed by the real and successful enterprise of Hannibal.]

[Footnote 189: I much regret our loss, or my ignorance, of two Arabic
works of the viiith century, a Life of Musa, and a poem on the exploits
of Tarik. Of these authentic pieces, the former was composed by a
grandson of Musa, who had escaped from the massacre of his kindred; the
latter, by the vizier of the first Abdalrahman, caliph of Spain,
who might have conversed with some of the veterans of the conqueror,
(Bibliot. Arabico-Hispana, tom. ii. p. 36, 139.)]

A province is assimilated to the victorious state by the introduction of
strangers and the imitative spirit of the natives; and Spain, which had
been successively tinctured with Punic, and Roman, and Gothic blood,
imbibed, in a few generations, the name and manners of the Arabs. The
first conquerors, and the twenty successive lieutenants of the caliphs,
were attended by a numerous train of civil and military followers, who
preferred a distant fortune to a narrow home: the private and public
interest was promoted by the establishment of faithful colonies; and the
cities of Spain were proud to commemorate the tribe or country of their
Eastern progenitors. The victorious though motley bands of Tarik
and Musa asserted, by the name of Spaniards, their original claim
of conquest; yet they allowed their brethren of Egypt to share their
establishments of Murcia and Lisbon. The royal legion of Damascus was
planted at Cordova; that of Emesa at Seville; that of Kinnisrin or
Chalcis at Jaen; that of Palestine at Algezire and Medina Sidonia. The
natives of Yemen and Persia were scattered round Toledo and the inland
country, and the fertile seats of Grenada were bestowed on ten thousand
horsemen of Syria and Irak, the children of the purest and most noble of
the Arabian tribes. [190] A spirit of emulation, sometimes beneficial,
more frequently dangerous, was nourished by these hereditary factions.
Ten years after the conquest, a map of the province was presented to
the caliph: the seas, the rivers, and the harbors, the inhabitants and
cities, the climate, the soil, and the mineral productions of the earth.
[191] In the space of two centuries, the gifts of nature were improved
by the agriculture, [192] the manufactures, and the commerce, of
an industrious people; and the effects of their diligence have been
magnified by the idleness of their fancy. The first of the Ommiades who
reigned in Spain solicited the support of the Christians; and in
his edict of peace and protection, he contents himself with a modest
imposition of ten thousand ounces of gold, ten thousand pounds of
silver, ten thousand horses, as many mules, one thousand cuirasses, with
an equal number of helmets and lances. [193] The most powerful of his
successors derived from the same kingdom the annual tribute of twelve
millions and forty-five thousand dinars or pieces of gold, about six
millions of sterling money; [194] a sum which, in the tenth century,
most probably surpassed the united revenues of the Christians monarchs.
His royal seat of Cordova contained six hundred moschs, nine hundred
baths, and two hundred thousand houses; he gave laws to eighty cities
of the first, to three hundred of the second and third order; and the
fertile banks of the Guadalquivir were adorned with twelve thousand
villages and hamlets. The Arabs might exaggerate the truth, but they
created and they describe the most prosperous aera of the riches, the
cultivation, and the populousness of Spain. [195]

[Footnote 190: Bibliot. Arab. Hispana, tom. ii. p. 32, 252. The former
of these quotations is taken from a Biographia Hispanica, by an Arabian
of Valentia, (see the copious Extracts of Casiri, tom. ii. p. 30-121;)
and the latter from a general Chronology of the Caliphs, and of the
African and Spanish Dynasties, with a particular History of the
kingdom of Grenada, of which Casiri has given almost an entire version,
(Bibliot. Arabico-Hispana, tom. ii. p. 177-319.) The author, Ebn
Khateb, a native of Grenada, and a contemporary of Novairi and Abulfeda,
(born A.D. 1313, died A.D. 1374,) was an historian, geographer,
physician, poet, &c., (tom. ii. p. 71, 72.)]

[Footnote 192: A copious treatise of husbandry, by an Arabian of
Seville, in the xiith century, is in the Escurial library, and Casiri
had some thoughts of translating it. He gives a list of the authors
quoted, Arabs as well as Greeks, Latins, &c.; but it is much if the
Andalusian saw these strangers through the medium of his countryman
Columella, (Casiri, Bibliot. Arabico-Hispana, tom. i. p. 323-338.)]

[Footnote 193: Bibliot. Arabico-Hispana, tom. ii. p. 104. Casiri
translates the original testimony of the historian Rasis, as it is
alleged in the Arabic Biographia Hispanica, pars ix. But I am
most exceedingly surprised at the address, Principibus caeterisque
Christianis, Hispanis suis Castellae. The name of Castellae was unknown
in the viiith century; the kingdom was not erected till the year 1022,
a hundred years after the time of Rasis, (Bibliot. tom. ii. p. 330,) and
the appellation was always expressive, not of a tributary province, but
of a line of castles independent of the Moorish yoke, (D'Anville, Etats
de l'Europe, p. 166-170.) Had Casiri been a critic, he would have
cleared a difficulty, perhaps of his own making.]

[Footnote 194: Cardonne, tom. i. p. 337, 338. He computes the revenue at
130,000,000 of French livres. The entire picture of peace and prosperity
relieves the bloody uniformity of the Moorish annals.]

[Footnote 195: I am happy enough to possess a splendid and interesting
work which has only been distributed in presents by the court of Madrid
Bibliotheca Arabico-Hispana Escurialensis, opera et studio Michaelis
Casiri, Syro Maronitoe. Matriti, in folio, tomus prior, 1760, tomus
posterior, 1770. The execution of this work does honor to the Spanish
press; the Mss., to the number of MDCCCLI., are judiciously classed by
the editor, and his copious extracts throw some light on the Mahometan
literature and history of Spain. These relics are now secure, but the
task has been supinely delayed, till, in the year 1671, a fire consumed
the greatest part of the Escurial library, rich in the spoils of Grenada
and Morocco. * Note: Compare the valuable work of Conde, Historia de la
Dominacion de las Arabes en Espana. Madrid, 1820.--M.]

The wars of the Moslems were sanctified by the prophet; but among the
various precepts and examples of his life, the caliphs selected the
lessons of toleration that might tend to disarm the resistance of the
unbelievers. Arabia was the temple and patrimony of the God of Mahomet;
but he beheld with less jealousy and affection the nations of the earth.
The polytheists and idolaters, who were ignorant of his name, might be
lawfully extirpated by his votaries; [196] but a wise policy supplied
the obligation of justice; and after some acts of intolerant zeal, the
Mahometan conquerors of Hindostan have spared the pagods of that devout
and populous country. The disciples of Abraham, of Moses, and of Jesus,
were solemnly invited to accept the more perfect revelation of Mahomet;
but if they preferred the payment of a moderate tribute, they were
entitled to the freedom of conscience and religious worship. [197] In a
field of battle the forfeit lives of the prisoners were redeemed by the
profession of Islam; the females were bound to embrace the religion of
their masters, and a race of sincere proselytes was gradually multiplied
by the education of the infant captives. But the millions of African
and Asiatic converts, who swelled the native band of the faithful Arabs,
must have been allured, rather than constrained, to declare their belief
in one God and the apostle of God. By the repetition of a sentence and
the loss of a foreskin, the subject or the slave, the captive or
the criminal, arose in a moment the free and equal companion of the
victorious Moslems. Every sin was expiated, every engagement was
dissolved: the vow of celibacy was superseded by the indulgence of
nature; the active spirits who slept in the cloister were awakened by
the trumpet of the Saracens; and in the convulsion of the world, every
member of a new society ascended to the natural level of his capacity
and courage. The minds of the multitude were tempted by the invisible as
well as temporal blessings of the Arabian prophet; and charity will
hope that many of his proselytes entertained a serious conviction of
the truth and sanctity of his revelation. In the eyes of an inquisitive
polytheist, it must appear worthy of the human and the divine nature.
More pure than the system of Zoroaster, more liberal than the law of
Moses, the religion of Mahomet might seem less inconsistent with reason
than the creed of mystery and superstition, which, in the seventh
century, disgraced the simplicity of the gospel.

[Footnote 196: The Harbii, as they are styled, qui tolerari nequeunt,
are, 1. Those who, besides God, worship the sun, moon, or idols. 2.
Atheists, Utrique, quamdiu princeps aliquis inter Mohammedanos superest,
oppugnari debent donec religionem amplectantur, nec requies iis
concedenda est, nec pretium acceptandum pro obtinenda conscientiae
libertate, (Reland, Dissertat. x. de Jure Militari Mohammedan. tom. iii.
p. 14;) a rigid theory!]

[Footnote 197: The distinction between a proscribed and a tolerated
sect, between the Harbii and the people of the Book, the believers in
some divine revelation, is correctly defined in the conversation of the
caliph Al Mamum with the idolaters or Sabaeans of Charrae, (Hottinger,
Hist. Orient. p. 107, 108.)]

In the extensive provinces of Persia and Africa, the national religion
has been eradicated by the Mahometan faith. The ambiguous theology
of the Magi stood alone among the sects of the East; but the profane
writings of Zoroaster [198] might, under the reverend name of Abraham,
be dexterously connected with the chain of divine revelation. Their evil
principle, the daemon Ahriman, might be represented as the rival, or as
the creature, of the God of light. The temples of Persia were devoid of
images; but the worship of the sun and of fire might be stigmatized as a
gross and criminal idolatry. [199] The milder sentiment was consecrated
by the practice of Mahomet [200] and the prudence of the caliphs; the
Magians or Ghebers were ranked with the Jews and Christians among the
people of the written law; [201] and as late as the third century of the
Hegira, the city of Herat will afford a lively contrast of private zeal
and public toleration. [202] Under the payment of an annual tribute, the
Mahometan law secured to the Ghebers of Herat their civil and religious
liberties: but the recent and humble mosch was overshadowed by the
antique splendor of the adjoining temple of fire. A fanatic Iman
deplored, in his sermons, the scandalous neighborhood, and accused the
weakness or indifference of the faithful. Excited by his voice, the
people assembled in tumult; the two houses of prayer were consumed
by the flames, but the vacant ground was immediately occupied by the
foundations of a new mosch. The injured Magi appealed to the sovereign
of Chorasan; he promised justice and relief; when, behold! four thousand
citizens of Herat, of a grave character and mature age, unanimously
swore that the idolatrous fane had never existed; the inquisition was
silenced and their conscience was satisfied (says the historian Mirchond
[203] with this holy and meritorious perjury. [204] But the greatest
part of the temples of Persia were ruined by the insensible and general
desertion of their votaries.

It was insensible, since it is not accompanied with any memorial of time
or place, of persecution or resistance. It was general, since the whole
realm, from Shiraz to Samarcand, imbibed the faith of the Koran; and the
preservation of the native tongue reveals the descent of the Mahometans
of Persia. [205] In the mountains and deserts, an obstinate race of
unbelievers adhered to the superstition of their fathers; and a faint
tradition of the Magian theology is kept alive in the province of
Kirman, along the banks of the Indus, among the exiles of Surat, and in
the colony which, in the last century, was planted by Shaw Abbas at
the gates of Ispahan. The chief pontiff has retired to Mount Elbourz,
eighteen leagues from the city of Yezd: the perpetual fire (if it
continues to burn) is inaccessible to the profane; but his residence is
the school, the oracle, and the pilgrimage of the Ghebers, whose hard
and uniform features attest the unmingled purity of their blood. Under
the jurisdiction of their elders, eighty thousand families maintain an
innocent and industrious life: their subsistence is derived from some
curious manufactures and mechanic trades; and they cultivate the earth
with the fervor of a religious duty. Their ignorance withstood the
despotism of Shaw Abbas, who demanded with threats and tortures the
prophetic books of Zoroaster; and this obscure remnant of the Magians is
spared by the moderation or contempt of their present sovereigns. [206]

[Footnote 198: The Zend or Pazend, the bible of the Ghebers, is reckoned
by themselves, or at least by the Mahometans, among the ten books which
Abraham received from heaven; and their religion is honorably styled
the religion of Abraham, (D'Herblot, Bibliot. Orient. p. 701; Hyde, de
Religione veterum Persarum, c, iii. p. 27, 28, &c.) I much fear that we
do not possess any pure and free description of the system of Zoroaster.
[1981] Dr. Prideaux (Connection, vol. i. p. 300, octavo) adopts the
opinion, that he had been the slave and scholar of some Jewish prophet
in the captivity of Babylon. Perhaps the Persians, who have been the
masters of the Jews, would assert the honor, a poor honor, of being
their masters.]

[Footnote 1981: Whatever the real age of the Zendavesta, published by
Anquetil du Perron, whether of the time of Ardeschir Babeghan, according
to Mr. Erskine, or of much higher antiquity, it may be considered, I
conceive, both a "pure and a free," though imperfect, description of
Zoroastrianism; particularly with the illustrations of the original
translator, and of the German Kleuker--M.]

[Footnote 199: The Arabian Nights, a faithful and amusing picture of the
Oriental world, represent in the most odious colors of the Magians, or
worshippers of fire, to whom they attribute the annual sacrifice of a
Mussulman. The religion of Zoroaster has not the least affinity with
that of the Hindoos, yet they are often confounded by the Mahometans;
and the sword of Timour was sharpened by this mistake, (Hist. de Timour
Bec, par Cherefeddin Ali Yezdi, l. v.)]

[Footnote 200: Vie de Mahomet, par Gagnier, (tom. iii. p. 114, 115.)]

[Footnote 201: Hae tres sectae, Judaei, Christiani, et qui inter
Persas Magorum institutis addicti sunt, populi libri dicuntur, (Reland,
Dissertat. tom. iii. p. 15.) The caliph Al Mamun confirms this honorable
distinction in favor of the three sects, with the vague and equivocal
religion of the Sabaeans, under which the ancient polytheists of Charrae
were allowed to shelter their idolatrous worship, (Hottinger, Hist.
Orient p. 167, 168.)]

[Footnote 202: This singular story is related by D'Herbelot, (Bibliot.
Orient. p 448, 449,) on the faith of Khondemir, and by Mirchond himself,
(Hist priorum Regum Persarum, &c., p. 9, 10, not. p. 88, 89.)]

[Footnote 203: Mirchond, (Mohammed Emir Khoondah Shah,) a native of
Herat, composed in the Persian language a general history of the East,
from the creation to the year of the Hegira 875, (A.D. 1471.) In the
year 904 (A.D. 1498) the historian obtained the command of a princely
library, and his applauded work, in seven or twelve parts, was
abbreviated in three volumes by his son Khondemir, A. H. 927, A.D. 1520.
The two writers, most accurately distinguished by Petit de la Croix,
(Hist. de Genghizcan, p.537, 538, 544, 545,) are loosely confounded by
D'Herbelot, (p. 358, 410, 994, 995: ) but his numerous extracts, under
the improper name of Khondemir, belong to the father rather than the
son. The historian of Genghizcan refers to a Ms. of Mirchond, which
he received from the hands of his friend D'Herbelot himself. A curious
fragment (the Taherian and Soffarian Dynasties) has been lately
published in Persic and Latin, (Viennae, 1782, in 4to., cum notis
Bernard de Jenisch;) and the editor allows us to hope for a continuation
of Mirchond.]

[Footnote 204: Quo testimonio boni se quidpiam praestitisse opinabantur.
Yet Mirchond must have condemned their zeal, since he approved the legal
toleration of the Magi, cui (the fire temple) peracto singulis annis
censu uti sacra Mohammedis lege cautum, ab omnibus molestiis ac oneribus
libero esse licuit.]

[Footnote 205: The last Magian of name and power appears to be Mardavige
the Dilemite, who, in the beginning of the 10th century, reigned in
the northern provinces of Persia, near the Caspian Sea, (D'Herbelot,

either professed or embraced the Mahometan faith; and under their
dynasty (A.D. 933-1020) I should say the fall of the religion of
Zoroaster.]

The Northern coast of Africa is the only land in which the light of
the gospel, after a long and perfect establishment, has been totally
extinguished. The arts, which had been taught by Carthage and Rome, were
involved in a cloud of ignorance; the doctrine of Cyprian and Augustin
was no longer studied. Five hundred episcopal churches were overturned
by the hostile fury of the Donatists, the Vandals, and the Moors.
The zeal and numbers of the clergy declined; and the people, without
discipline, or knowledge, or hope, submissively sunk under the yoke
of the Arabian prophet Within fifty years after the expulsion of the
Greeks, a lieutenant of Africa informed the caliph that the tribute of
the infidels was abolished by their conversion; [207] and, though he
sought to disguise his fraud and rebellion, his specious pretence was
drawn from the rapid and extensive progress of the Mahometan faith. In
the next age, an extraordinary mission of five bishops was detached from
Alexandria to Cairoan. They were ordained by the Jacobite patriarch
to cherish and revive the dying embers of Christianity: [208] but the
interposition of a foreign prelate, a stranger to the Latins, an enemy
to the Catholics, supposes the decay and dissolution of the African
hierarchy. It was no longer the time when the successor of St. Cyprian,
at the head of a numerous synod, could maintain an equal contest
with the ambition of the Roman pontiff. In the eleventh century, the
unfortunate priest who was seated on the ruins of Carthage implored the
arms and the protection of the Vatican; and he bitterly complains that
his naked body had been scourged by the Saracens, and that his authority
was disputed by the four suffragans, the tottering pillars of his
throne. Two epistles of Gregory the Seventh [209] are destined to soothe
the distress of the Catholics and the pride of a Moorish prince. The
pope assures the sultan that they both worship the same God, and may
hope to meet in the bosom of Abraham; but the complaint that three
bishops could no longer be found to consecrate a brother, announces the
speedy and inevitable ruin of the episcopal order. The Christians
of Africa and Spain had long since submitted to the practice of
circumcision and the legal abstinence from wine and pork; and the
name of Mozarabes [210] (adoptive Arabs) was applied to their civil or
religious conformity. [211] About the middle of the twelfth century, the
worship of Christ and the succession of pastors were abolished along
the coast of Barbary, and in the kingdoms of Cordova and Seville, of
Valencia and Grenada. [212] The throne of the Almohades, or Unitarians,
was founded on the blindest fanaticism, and their extraordinary rigor
might be provoked or justified by the recent victories and intolerant
zeal of the princes of Sicily and Castille, of Arragon and Portugal.
The faith of the Mozarabes was occasionally revived by the papal
missionaries; and, on the landing of Charles the Fifth, some families
of Latin Christians were encouraged to rear their heads at Tunis and
Algiers. But the seed of the gospel was quickly eradicated, and the
long province from Tripoli to the Atlantic has lost all memory of the
language and religion of Rome. [213]

are copied from some older book. I shall add, that the date of the
Hegira 677 (A.D. 1278) must apply to the copy, not the composition, of
a treatise of a jurisprudence, which states the civil rights of the
Christians of Cordova, (Bibliot. Arab. Hisp. tom. i. p. 471;) and that
the Jews were the only dissenters whom Abul Waled, king of Grenada,
(A.D. 1313,) could either discountenance or tolerate, (tom. ii. p.

After the revolution of eleven centuries, the Jews and Christians of the
Turkish empire enjoy the liberty of conscience which was granted by the
Arabian caliphs. During the first age of the conquest, they suspected
the loyalty of the Catholics, whose name of Melchites betrayed their
secret attachment to the Greek emperor, while the Nestorians and
Jacobites, his inveterate enemies, approved themselves the sincere and
voluntary friends of the Mahometan government. [214] Yet this partial
jealousy was healed by time and submission; the churches of Egypt
were shared with the Catholics; [215] and all the Oriental sects were
included in the common benefits of toleration. The rank, the immunities,
the domestic jurisdiction of the patriarchs, the bishops, and the
clergy, were protected by the civil magistrate: the learning of
individuals recommended them to the employments of secretaries and
physicians: they were enriched by the lucrative collection of the
revenue; and their merit was sometimes raised to the command of cities
and provinces. A caliph of the house of Abbas was heard to declare
that the Christians were most worthy of trust in the administration of
Persia. "The Moslems," said he, "will abuse their present fortune; the
Magians regret their fallen greatness; and the Jews are impatient for
their approaching deliverance." [216] But the slaves of despotism are
exposed to the alternatives of favor and disgrace. The captive churches
of the East have been afflicted in every age by the avarice or bigotry
of their rulers; and the ordinary and legal restraints must be offensive
to the pride, or the zeal, of the Christians. [217] About two hundred
years after Mahomet, they were separated from their fellow-subjects by a
turban or girdle of a less honorable color; instead of horses or mules.
they were condemned to ride on asses, in the attitude of women. Their
public and private building were measured by a diminutive standard; in
the streets or the baths it is their duty to give way or bow down before
the meanest of the people; and their testimony is rejected, if it may
tend to the prejudice of a true believer. The pomp of processions, the
sound of bells or of psalmody, is interdicted in their worship; a
decent reverence for the national faith is imposed on their sermons
and conversations; and the sacrilegious attempt to enter a mosch, or to
seduce a Mussulman, will not be suffered to escape with impunity. In a
time, however, of tranquillity and justice, the Christians have never
been compelled to renounce the Gospel, or to embrace the Koran; but the
punishment of death is inflicted upon the apostates who have professed
and deserted the law of Mahomet. The martyrs of Cordova provoked the
sentence of the cadhi, by the public confession of their inconstancy,
or their passionate invectives against the person and religion of the
prophet. [218]

the Collections of Assemannus (Bibliot. Orient. tom. iv. p. 94-101) the
state of the Nestorians under the caliphs. That of the Jacobites is more
concisely exposed in the Preliminary Dissertation of the second volume
of Assemannus.]

II. is related, and most probably magnified, by the Greek Theophanes
(Chron p. 334.)]

[Footnote 218: The martyrs of Cordova (A.D. 850, &c.) are commemorated
and justified by St. Eulogius, who at length fell a victim himself. A
synod, convened by the caliph, ambiguously censured their rashness. The
moderate Fleury cannot reconcile their conduct with the discipline of
antiquity, toutefois l'autorite de l'eglise, &c. (Fleury, Hist. Eccles.
tom. x. p. 415-522, particularly p. 451, 508, 509.) Their authentic
acts throw a strong, though transient, light on the Spanish church in
the ixth century.]

At the end of the first century of the Hegira, the caliphs were the most
potent and absolute monarchs of the globe. Their prerogative was not
circumscribed, either in right or in fact, by the power of the nobles,
the freedom of the commons, the privileges of the church, the votes of
a senate, or the memory of a free constitution. The authority of the
companions of Mahomet expired with their lives; and the chiefs or emirs
of the Arabian tribes left behind, in the desert, the spirit of equality
and independence. The regal and sacerdotal characters were united in the
successors of Mahomet; and if the Koran was the rule of their actions,
they were the supreme judges and interpreters of that divine book. They
reigned by the right of conquest over the nations of the East, to whom
the name of liberty was unknown, and who were accustomed to applaud in
their tyrants the acts of violence and severity that were exercised at
their own expense. Under the last of the Ommiades, the Arabian empire
extended two hundred days' journey from east to west, from the confines
of Tartary and India to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean. And if we
retrench the sleeve of the robe, as it is styled by their writers, the
long and narrow province of Africa, the solid and compact dominion from
Fargana to Aden, from Tarsus to Surat, will spread on every side to
the measure of four or five months of the march of a caravan. [219]
We should vainly seek the indissoluble union and easy obedience that
pervaded the government of Augustus and the Antonines; but the progress
of the Mahometan religion diffused over this ample space a general
resemblance of manners and opinions. The language and laws of the Koran
were studied with equal devotion at Samarcand and Seville: the Moor
and the Indian embraced as countrymen and brothers in the pilgrimage of
Mecca; and the Arabian language was adopted as the popular idiom in all
the provinces to the westward of the Tigris. [220]

[Footnote 219: See the article Eslamiah, (as we say Christendom,) in the
Bibliotheque Orientale, (p. 325.) This chart of the Mahometan world is
suited by the author, Ebn Alwardi, to the year of the Hegira 385 (A.D.
995.) Since that time, the losses in Spain have been overbalanced by the
conquests in India, Tartary, and the European Turkey.]

[Footnote 220: The Arabic of the Koran is taught as a dead language in
the college of Mecca. By the Danish traveller, this ancient idiom is
compared to the Latin; the vulgar tongue of Hejaz and Yemen to the
Italian; and the Arabian dialects of Syria, Egypt, Africa, &c., to the
Provencal, Spanish, and Portuguese, (Niebuhr, Description de l'Arabie,
p. 74, &c.)]
