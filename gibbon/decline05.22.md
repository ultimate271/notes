When the Arabs first issued from the desert, they must have been
surprised at the ease and rapidity of their own success. But when they
advanced in the career of victory to the banks of the Indus and the
summit of the Pyrenees; when they had repeatedly tried the edge of their
cimeters and the energy of their faith, they might be equally astonished
that any nation could resist their invincible arms; that any boundary
should confine the dominion of the successor of the prophet. The
confidence of soldiers and fanatics may indeed be excused, since the
calm historian of the present hour, who strives to follow the rapid
course of the Saracens, must study to explain by what means the church
and state were saved from this impending, and, as it should seem, from
this inevitable, danger. The deserts of Scythia and Sarmatia might be
guarded by their extent, their climate, their poverty, and the courage
of the northern shepherds; China was remote and inaccessible; but
the greatest part of the temperate zone was subject to the Mahometan
conquerors, the Greeks were exhausted by the calamities of war and the
loss of their fairest provinces, and the Barbarians of Europe might
justly tremble at the precipitate fall of the Gothic monarchy. In this
inquiry I shall unfold the events that rescued our ancestors of Britain,
and our neighbors of Gaul, from the civil and religious yoke of the
Koran; that protected the majesty of Rome, and delayed the servitude
of Constantinople; that invigorated the defence of the Christians, and
scattered among their enemies the seeds of division and decay.

Forty-six years after the flight of Mahomet from Mecca, his disciples
appeared in arms under the walls of Constantinople. [1] They were
animated by a genuine or fictitious saying of the prophet, that, to
the first army which besieged the city of the Caesars, their sins were
forgiven: the long series of Roman triumphs would be meritoriously
transferred to the conquerors of New Rome; and the wealth of nations was
deposited in this well-chosen seat of royalty and commerce. No sooner
had the caliph Moawiyah suppressed his rivals and established his
throne, than he aspired to expiate the guilt of civil blood, by the
success and glory of this holy expedition; [2] his preparations by sea
and land were adequate to the importance of the object; his standard was
intrusted to Sophian, a veteran warrior, but the troops were encouraged
by the example and presence of Yezid, the son and presumptive heir of
the commander of the faithful. The Greeks had little to hope, nor had
their enemies any reason of fear, from the courage and vigilance of the
reigning emperor, who disgraced the name of Constantine, and imitated
only the inglorious years of his grandfather Heraclius. Without delay
or opposition, the naval forces of the Saracens passed through the
unguarded channel of the Hellespont, which even now, under the feeble
and disorderly government of the Turks, is maintained as the natural
bulwark of the capital. [3] The Arabian fleet cast anchor, and the
troops were disembarked near the palace of Hebdomon, seven miles from
the city. During many days, from the dawn of light to the evening,
the line of assault was extended from the golden gate to the eastern
promontory and the foremost warriors were impelled by the weight and
effort of the succeeding columns. But the besiegers had formed an
insufficient estimate of the strength and resources of Constantinople.
The solid and lofty walls were guarded by numbers and discipline: the
spirit of the Romans was rekindled by the last danger of their religion
and empire: the fugitives from the conquered provinces more successfully
renewed the defence of Damascus and Alexandria; and the Saracens were
dismayed by the strange and prodigious effects of artificial fire.
This firm and effectual resistance diverted their arms to the more easy
attempt of plundering the European and Asiatic coasts of the Propontis;
and, after keeping the sea from the month of April to that of September,
on the approach of winter they retreated fourscore miles from the
capital, to the Isle of Cyzicus, in which they had established their
magazine of spoil and provisions. So patient was their perseverance,
or so languid were their operations, that they repeated in the six
following summers the same attack and retreat, with a gradual abatement
of hope and vigor, till the mischances of shipwreck and disease, of
the sword and of fire, compelled them to relinquish the fruitless
enterprise. They might bewail the loss, or commemorate the martyrdom,
of thirty thousand Moslems, who fell in the siege of Constantinople;
and the solemn funeral of Abu Ayub, or Job, excited the curiosity of the
Christians themselves.

That venerable Arab, one of the last of the companions of Mahomet, was
numbered among the ansars, or auxiliaries, of Medina, who sheltered the
head of the flying prophet. In his youth he fought, at Beder and
Ohud, under the holy standard: in his mature age he was the friend
and follower of Ali; and the last remnant of his strength and life
was consumed in a distant and dangerous war against the enemies of the
Koran. His memory was revered; but the place of his burial was neglected
and unknown, during a period of seven hundred and eighty years, till the
conquest of Constantinople by Mahomet the Second. A seasonable vision
(for such are the manufacture of every religion) revealed the holy spot
at the foot of the walls and the bottom of the harbor; and the mosch of
Ayub has been deservedly chosen for the simple and martial inauguration
of the Turkish sultans. [4]

[Footnote 1: Theophanes places the seven years of the siege of
Constantinople in the year of our Christian aera, 673 (of the
Alexandrian 665, Sept. 1,) and the peace of the Saracens, four years
afterwards; a glaring inconsistency! which Petavius, Goar, and Pagi,
(Critica, tom. iv. p. 63, 64,) have struggled to remove. Of the
Arabians, the Hegira 52 (A.D. 672, January 8) is assigned by Elmacin,
the year 48 (A.D. 688, Feb. 20) by Abulfeda, whose testimony I esteem
the most convenient and credible.]

fortify them against the Russians. From a principal actor, I should have
expected more accurate details; but he seems to write for the amusement,
rather than the instruction, of his reader. Perhaps, on the approach
of the enemy, the minister of Constantine was occupied, like that of
Mustapha, in finding two Canary birds who should sing precisely the same
note.]

Abu Ayub is vulgarly confounded with the patriarch Job, betray their own
ignorance rather than that of the Turks.]

The event of the siege revived, both in the East and West, the
reputation of the Roman arms, and cast a momentary shade over the
glories of the Saracens. The Greek ambassador was favorably received at
Damascus, a general council of the emirs or Koreish: a peace, or
truce, of thirty years was ratified between the two empires; and the
stipulation of an annual tribute, fifty horses of a noble breed, fifty
slaves, and three thousand pieces of gold, degraded the majesty of
the commander of the faithful. [5] The aged caliph was desirous of
possessing his dominions, and ending his days in tranquillity and
repose: while the Moors and Indians trembled at his name, his palace and
city of Damascus was insulted by the Mardaites, or Maronites, of Mount
Libanus, the firmest barrier of the empire, till they were disarmed
and transplanted by the suspicious policy of the Greeks. [6] After the
revolt of Arabia and Persia, the house of Ommiyah was reduced to the
kingdoms of Syria and Egypt: their distress and fear enforced their
compliance with the pressing demands of the Christians; and the tribute
was increased to a slave, a horse, and a thousand pieces of gold, for
each of the three hundred and sixty-five days of the solar year. But
as soon as the empire was again united by the arms and policy of
Abdalmalek, he disclaimed a badge of servitude not less injurious to
his conscience than to his pride; he discontinued the payment of the
tribute; and the resentment of the Greeks was disabled from action
by the mad tyranny of the second Justinian, the just rebellion of his
subjects, and the frequent change of his antagonists and successors.
Till the reign of Abdalmalek, the Saracens had been content with the
free possession of the Persian and Roman treasures, in the coins of
Chosroes and Caesar. By the command of that caliph, a national mint was
established, both for silver and gold, and the inscription of the Dinar,
though it might be censured by some timorous casuists, proclaimed the
unity of the God of Mahomet. [8] Under the reign of the caliph Walid,
the Greek language and characters were excluded from the accounts of the
public revenue. [9] If this change was productive of the invention or
familiar use of our present numerals, the Arabic or Indian ciphers, as
they are commonly styled, a regulation of office has promoted the most
important discoveries of arithmetic, algebra, and the mathematical
sciences. [10]

[Footnote 5: Theophanes, though a Greek, deserves credit for these
tributes, (Chronograph. p. 295, 296, 300, 301,) which are confirmed,
with some variation, by the Arabic History of Abulpharagius, (Dynast. p.
128, vers. Pocock.)]

[Footnote 6: The censure of Theophanes is just and pointed,
(Chronograph. p. 302, 303.) The series of these events may be traced
in the Annals of Theophanes, and in the Abridgment of the patriarch
Nicephorus, p. 22, 24.]

[Footnote 7: These domestic revolutions are related in a clear and
natural style, in the second volume of Ockley's History of the Saracens,
p. 253-370. Besides our printed authors, he draws his materials from
the Arabic Mss. of Oxford, which he would have more deeply searched had
he been confined to the Bodleian library instead of the city jail a fate
how unworthy of the man and of his country!]

[Footnote 8: Elmacin, who dates the first coinage A. H. 76, A.D. 695,
five or six years later than the Greek historians, has compared the
weight of the best or common gold dinar to the drachm or dirhem of
Egypt, (p. 77,) which may be equal to two pennies (48 grains) of our
Troy weight, (Hooper's Inquiry into Ancient Measures, p. 24-36,) and
equivalent to eight shillings of our sterling money. From the same
Elmacin and the Arabian physicians, some dinars as high as two dirhems,
as low as half a dirhem, may be deduced. The piece of silver was the
dirhem, both in value and weight; but an old, though fair coin, struck
at Waset, A. H. 88, and preserved in the Bodleian library, wants four
grains of the Cairo standard, (see the Modern Universal History, tom. i.
p. 548 of the French translation.) * Note: Up to this time the Arabs had
used the Roman or the Persian coins or had minted others which resembled
them. Nevertheless, it has been admitted of late years, that the
Arabians, before this epoch, had caused coin to be minted, on which,
preserving the Roman or the Persian dies, they added Arabian names or
inscriptions. Some of these exist in different collections. We learn
from Makrizi, an Arabian author of great learning and judgment, that in
the year 18 of the Hegira, under the caliphate of Omar, the Arabs had
coined money of this description. The same author informs us that the
caliph Abdalmalek caused coins to be struck representing himself with a
sword by his side. These types, so contrary to the notions of the Arabs,
were disapproved by the most influential persons of the time, and the
caliph substituted for them, after the year 76 of the Hegira, the
Mahometan coins with which we are acquainted. Consult, on the question
of Arabic numismatics, the works of Adler, of Fraehn, of Castiglione,
and of Marsden, who have treated at length this interesting point of
historic antiquities. See, also, in the Journal Asiatique, tom. ii. p.
257, et seq., a paper of M. Silvestre de Sacy, entitled Des Monnaies des
Khalifes avant l'An 75 de l'Hegire. See, also the translation of a
German paper on the Arabic medals of the Chosroes, by M. Fraehn. in the
same Journal Asiatique tom. iv. p. 331-347. St. Martin, vol. xii. p. 19,
--M.]

[Footnote 9: Theophan. Chronograph. p. 314. This defect, if it really
existed, must have stimulated the ingenuity of the Arabs to invent or
borrow.]

[Footnote 10: According to a new, though probable, notion, maintained by
M de Villoison, (Anecdota Graeca, tom. ii. p. 152-157,) our ciphers are
not of Indian or Arabic invention. They were used by the Greek and Latin
arithmeticians long before the age of Boethius. After the extinction of
science in the West, they were adopted by the Arabic versions from the
original Mss., and restored to the Latins about the xith century. *

Introduction to the Literature of Europe, p. 150, note, and the authors

Whilst the caliph Walid sat idle on the throne of Damascus, whilst his
lieutenants achieved the conquest of Transoxiana and Spain, a third army
of Saracens overspread the provinces of Asia Minor, and approached the
borders of the Byzantine capital. But the attempt and disgrace of
the second siege was reserved for his brother Soliman, whose ambition
appears to have been quickened by a more active and martial spirit. In
the revolutions of the Greek empire, after the tyrant Justinian had been
punished and avenged, an humble secretary, Anastasius or Artemius, was
promoted by chance or merit to the vacant purple. He was alarmed by
the sound of war; and his ambassador returned from Damascus with the
tremendous news, that the Saracens were preparing an armament by sea and
land, such as would transcend the experience of the past, or the belief
of the present age. The precautions of Anastasius were not unworthy of
his station, or of the impending danger. He issued a peremptory mandate,
that all persons who were not provided with the means of subsistence for
a three years' siege should evacuate the city: the public granaries
and arsenals were abundantly replenished; the walls were restored and
strengthened; and the engines for casting stones, or darts, or fire,
were stationed along the ramparts, or in the brigantines of war, of
which an additional number was hastily constructed. To prevent is safer,
as well as more honorable, than to repel, an attack; and a design was
meditated, above the usual spirit of the Greeks, of burning the naval
stores of the enemy, the cypress timber that had been hewn in Mount
Libanus, and was piled along the sea-shore of Phoenicia, for the service
of the Egyptian fleet. This generous enterprise was defeated by the
cowardice or treachery of the troops, who, in the new language of the
empire, were styled of the Obsequian Theme. [11] They murdered their
chief, deserted their standard in the Isle of Rhodes, dispersed
themselves over the adjacent continent, and deserved pardon or reward by
investing with the purple a simple officer of the revenue. The name of
Theodosius might recommend him to the senate and people; but, after some
months, he sunk into a cloister, and resigned, to the firmer hand of
Leo the Isaurian, the urgent defence of the capital and empire. The most
formidable of the Saracens, Moslemah, the brother of the caliph, was
advancing at the head of one hundred and twenty thousand Arabs and
Persians, the greater part mounted on horses or camels; and the
successful sieges of Tyana, Amorium, and Pergamus, were of sufficient
duration to exercise their skill and to elevate their hopes. At the
well-known passage of Abydus, on the Hellespont, the Mahometan arms
were transported, for the first time, [1111] from Asia to Europe. From
thence, wheeling round the Thracian cities of the Propontis, Moslemah
invested Constantinople on the land side, surrounded his camp with a
ditch and rampart, prepared and planted his engines of assault, and
declared, by words and actions, a patient resolution of expecting the
return of seed-time and harvest, should the obstinacy of the besieged
prove equal to his own. [1112] The Greeks would gladly have ransomed
their religion and empire, by a fine or assessment of a piece of gold
on the head of each inhabitant of the city; but the liberal offer was
rejected with disdain, and the presumption of Moslemah was exalted by
the speedy approach and invincible force of the natives of Egypt and
Syria. They are said to have amounted to eighteen hundred ships: the
number betrays their inconsiderable size; and of the twenty stout and
capacious vessels, whose magnitude impeded their progress, each was
manned with no more than one hundred heavy-armed soldiers. This huge
armada proceeded on a smooth sea, and with a gentle gale, towards the
mouth of the Bosphorus; the surface of the strait was overshadowed, in
the language of the Greeks, with a moving forest, and the same fatal
night had been fixed by the Saracen chief for a general assault by sea
and land. To allure the confidence of the enemy, the emperor had thrown
aside the chain that usually guarded the entrance of the harbor; but
while they hesitated whether they should seize the opportunity, or
apprehend the snare, the ministers of destruction were at hand. The
fire-ships of the Greeks were launched against them; the Arabs, their
arms, and vessels, were involved in the same flames; the disorderly
fugitives were dashed against each other or overwhelmed in the waves;
and I no longer find a vestige of the fleet, that had threatened to
extirpate the Roman name. A still more fatal and irreparable loss was
that of the caliph Soliman, who died of an indigestion, [12] in his camp
near Kinnisrin or Chalcis in Syria, as he was preparing to lead against
Constantinople the remaining forces of the East. The brother of Moslemah
was succeeded by a kinsman and an enemy; and the throne of an active
and able prince was degraded by the useless and pernicious virtues of
a bigot. [1211] While he started and satisfied the scruples of a blind
conscience, the siege was continued through the winter by the neglect,
rather than by the resolution of the caliph Omar. [13] The winter proved
uncommonly rigorous: above a hundred days the ground was covered with
deep snow, and the natives of the sultry climes of Egypt and Arabia lay
torpid and almost lifeless in their frozen camp. They revived on the
return of spring; a second effort had been made in their favor; and
their distress was relieved by the arrival of two numerous fleets, laden
with corn, and arms, and soldiers; the first from Alexandria, of four
hundred transports and galleys; the second of three hundred and sixty
vessels from the ports of Africa. But the Greek fires were again
kindled; and if the destruction was less complete, it was owing to the
experience which had taught the Moslems to remain at a safe distance, or
to the perfidy of the Egyptian mariners, who deserted with their ships
to the emperor of the Christians. The trade and navigation of the
capital were restored; and the produce of the fisheries supplied the
wants, and even the luxury, of the inhabitants. But the calamities of
famine and disease were soon felt by the troops of Moslemah, and as the
former was miserably assuaged, so the latter was dreadfully propagated,
by the pernicious nutriment which hunger compelled them to extract from
the most unclean or unnatural food. The spirit of conquest, and even of
enthusiasm, was extinct: the Saracens could no longer struggle, beyond
their lines, either single or in small parties, without exposing
themselves to the merciless retaliation of the Thracian peasants.

An army of Bulgarians was attracted from the Danube by the gifts and
promises of Leo; and these savage auxiliaries made some atonement for
the evils which they had inflicted on the empire, by the defeat and
slaughter of twenty-two thousand Asiatics. A report was dexterously
scattered, that the Franks, the unknown nations of the Latin world, were
arming by sea and land in the defence of the Christian cause, and their
formidable aid was expected with far different sensations in the camp
and city. At length, after a siege of thirteen months, [14] the hopeless
Moslemah received from the caliph the welcome permission of retreat.
[1411] The march of the Arabian cavalry over the Hellespont and through
the provinces of Asia, was executed without delay or molestation; but an
army of their brethren had been cut in pieces on the side of Bithynia,
and the remains of the fleet were so repeatedly damaged by tempest and
fire, that only five galleys entered the port of Alexandria to relate
the tale of their various and almost incredible disasters. [15]

[Footnote 11: In the division of the Themes, or provinces described
by Constantine Porphyrogenitus, (de Thematibus, l. i. p. 9, 10,) the
Obsequium, a Latin appellation of the army and palace, was the fourth in
the public order. Nice was the metropolis, and its jurisdiction extended
from the Hellespont over the adjacent parts of Bithynia and Phrygia,
(see the two maps prefixed by Delisle to the Imperium Orientale of
Banduri.)]

[Footnote 1111: Compare page 274. It is singular that Gibbon should
thus contradict himself in a few pages. By his own account this was the
second time.--M.]

[Footnote 1112: The account of this siege in the Tarikh Tebry is a very
unfavorable specimen of Asiatic history, full of absurd fables, and
written with total ignorance of the circumstances of time and place.
Price, vol. i. p. 498--M.]

[Footnote 12: The caliph had emptied two baskets of eggs and of figs,
which he swallowed alternately, and the repast was concluded with marrow
and sugar. In one of his pilgrimages to Mecca, Soliman ate, at a single
meal, seventy pomegranates, a kid, six fowls, and a huge quantity of
the grapes of Tayef. If the bill of fare be correct, we must admire the
appetite, rather than the luxury, of the sovereign of Asia, (Abulfeda,
Annal. Moslem. p. 126.) * Note: The Tarikh Tebry ascribes the death
of Soliman to a pleurisy. The same gross gluttony in which Soliman
indulged, though not fatal to the life, interfered with the military
duties, of his brother Moslemah. Price, vol. i. p. 511.--M.]

[Footnote 1211: Major Price's estimate of Omar's character is much more
favorable. Among a race of sanguinary tyrants, Omar was just and humane.
His virtues as well as his bigotry were active.--M.]

[Footnote 13: See the article of Omar Ben Abdalaziz, in the Bibliotheque
Orientale, (p. 689, 690,) praeferens, says Elmacin, (p. 91,) religionem
suam rebus suis mundanis. He was so desirous of being with God, that
he would not have anointed his ear (his own saying) to obtain a perfect
cure of his last malady. The caliph had only one shirt, and in an age of
luxury, his annual expense was no more than two drachms, (Abulpharagius,
p. 131.) Haud diu gavisus eo principe fuit urbis Muslemus, (Abulfeda, p.
127.)]

[Footnote 14: Both Nicephorus and Theophanes agree that the siege of
Constantinople was raised the 15th of August, (A.D. 718;) but as the
former, our best witness, affirms that it continued thirteen months, the
latter must be mistaken in supposing that it began on the same day
of the preceding year. I do not find that Pagi has remarked this
inconsistency.]

with some extraordinary and incredible circumstances. Price, p.
514.--M.]

[Footnote 15: In the second siege of Constantinople, I have followed
Nicephorus, (Brev. p. 33-36,) Theophanes, (Chronograph, p. 324-334,)
Cedrenus, (Compend. p. 449-452,) Zonaras, (tom. ii. p. 98-102,)
Elmacin, (Hist. Saracen, p. 88,) Abulfeda, (Annal. Moslem. p. 126,) and
Abulpharagius, (Dynast. p. 130,) the most satisfactory of the Arabs.]

In the two sieges, the deliverance of Constantinople may be chiefly
ascribed to the novelty, the terrors, and the real efficacy of the
Greek fire. [16] The important secret of compounding and directing this
artificial flame was imparted by Callinicus, a native of Heliopolis
in Syria, who deserted from the service of the caliph to that of the
emperor. [17] The skill of a chemist and engineer was equivalent to the
succor of fleets and armies; and this discovery or improvement of the
military art was fortunately reserved for the distressful period, when
the degenerate Romans of the East were incapable of contending with the
warlike enthusiasm and youthful vigor of the Saracens. The historian who
presumes to analyze this extraordinary composition should suspect
his own ignorance and that of his Byzantine guides, so prone to the
marvellous, so careless, and, in this instance, so jealous of the truth.
From their obscure, and perhaps fallacious, hints it should seem that
the principal ingredient of the Greek fire was the naphtha, [18] or
liquid bitumen, a light, tenacious, and inflammable oil, [19] which
springs from the earth, and catches fire as soon as it comes in contact
with the air. The naphtha was mingled, I know not by what methods or in
what proportions, with sulphur and with the pitch that is extracted from
evergreen firs. [20] From this mixture, which produced a thick smoke and
a loud explosion, proceeded a fierce and obstinate flame, which not only
rose in perpendicular ascent, but likewise burnt with equal vehemence
in descent or lateral progress; instead of being extinguished, it was
nourished and quickened by the element of water; and sand, urine,
or vinegar, were the only remedies that could damp the fury of this
powerful agent, which was justly denominated by the Greeks the liquid,
or the maritime, fire. For the annoyance of the enemy, it was employed
with equal effect, by sea and land, in battles or in sieges. It was
either poured from the rampart in large boilers, or launched in red-hot
balls of stone and iron, or darted in arrows and javelins, twisted
round with flax and tow, which had deeply imbibed the inflammable oil;
sometimes it was deposited in fire-ships, the victims and instruments of
a more ample revenge, and was most commonly blown through long tubes of
copper which were planted on the prow of a galley, and fancifully shaped
into the mouths of savage monsters, that seemed to vomit a stream
of liquid and consuming fire. This important art was preserved at
Constantinople, as the palladium of the state: the galleys and artillery
might occasionally be lent to the allies of Rome; but the composition
of the Greek fire was concealed with the most jealous scruple, and the
terror of the enemies was increased and prolonged by their ignorance and
surprise. In the treaties of the administration of the empire, the royal
author [21] suggests the answers and excuses that might best elude the
indiscreet curiosity and importunate demands of the Barbarians. They
should be told that the mystery of the Greek fire had been revealed by
an angel to the first and greatest of the Constantines, with a sacred
injunction, that this gift of Heaven, this peculiar blessing of the
Romans, should never be communicated to any foreign nation; that the
prince and the subject were alike bound to religious silence under the
temporal and spiritual penalties of treason and sacrilege; and that the
impious attempt would provoke the sudden and supernatural vengeance
of the God of the Christians. By these precautions, the secret was
confined, above four hundred years, to the Romans of the East; and at
the end of the eleventh century, the Pisans, to whom every sea and
every art were familiar, suffered the effects, without understanding the
composition, of the Greek fire. It was at length either discovered or
stolen by the Mahometans; and, in the holy wars of Syria and Egypt, they
retorted an invention, contrived against themselves, on the heads of
the Christians. A knight, who despised the swords and lances of the
Saracens, relates, with heartfelt sincerity, his own fears, and those
of his companions, at the sight and sound of the mischievous engine
that discharged a torrent of the Greek fire, the feu Gregeois, as it is
styled by the more early of the French writers. It came flying through
the air, says Joinville, [22] like a winged long-tailed dragon, about
the thickness of a hogshead, with the report of thunder and the velocity
of lightning; and the darkness of the night was dispelled by this deadly
illumination. The use of the Greek, or, as it might now be called, of
the Saracen fire, was continued to the middle of the fourteenth century,
[23] when the scientific or casual compound of nitre, sulphur, and
charcoal, effected a new revolution in the art of war and the history of
mankind. [24]

[Footnote 16: Our sure and indefatigable guide in the middle ages and
Byzantine history, Charles du Fresne du Cange, has treated in several
places of the Greek fire, and his collections leave few gleanings
behind. See particularly Glossar. Med. et Infim. Graecitat. p. 1275, sub
voce. Glossar. Med. et Infim. Latinitat. Ignis Groecus. Observations sur
Villehardouin, p. 305, 306. Observations sur Joinville, p. 71, 72.]

[Footnote 17: Theophanes styles him, (p. 295.) Cedrenus (p. 437) brings
this artist from (the ruins of) Heliopolis in Egypt; and chemistry was
indeed the peculiar science of the Egyptians.]

[Footnote 18: The naphtha, the oleum incendiarium of the history of
Jerusalem, (Gest. Dei per Francos, p. 1167,) the Oriental fountain of
James de Vitry, (l. iii. c. 84,) is introduced on slight evidence and
strong probability. Cinanmus (l. vi. p. 165) calls the Greek fire: and
the naphtha is known to abound between the Tigris and the Caspian Sea.
According to Pliny, (Hist. Natur. ii. 109,) it was subservient to the
revenge of Medea, and in either etymology, (Procop. de Bell. Gothic.
l. iv. c. 11,) may fairly signify this liquid bitumen. * Note: It is
remarkable that the Syrian historian Michel gives the name of naphtha
to the newly-invented Greek fire, which seems to indicate that this
substance formed the base of the destructive compound. St. Martin, tom.

Watson's (the present bishop of Llandaff's) Chemical Essays, vol. iii.
essay i., a classic book, the best adapted to infuse the taste and
knowledge of chemistry. The less perfect ideas of the ancients may be
found in Strabo (Geograph. l. xvi. p. 1078) and Pliny, (Hist. Natur.
ii. 108, 109.) Huic (Naphthae) magna cognatio est ignium, transiliuntque
protinus in eam undecunque visam. Of our travellers I am best pleased
with Otter, (tom. i. p. 153, 158.)]

[Footnote 20: Anna Comnena has partly drawn aside the curtain. (Alexiad.
l. xiii. p. 383.) Elsewhere (l. xi. p. 336) she mentions the property of
burning. Leo, in the xixth chapter of his Tactics, (Opera Meursii, tom.
vi. p. 843, edit. Lami, Florent. 1745,) speaks of the new invention.
These are genuine and Imperial testimonies.]

[Footnote 22: Histoire de St. Louis, p. 39. Paris, 1668, p. 44. Paris,
de l'Imprimerie Royale, 1761. The former of these editions is precious
for the observations of Ducange; the latter for the pure and original
text of Joinville. We must have recourse to that text to discover, that
the feu Gregeois was shot with a pile or javelin, from an engine that
acted like a sling.]

[Footnote 23: The vanity, or envy, of shaking the established property
of Fame, has tempted some moderns to carry gunpowder above the xivth,
(see Sir William Temple, Dutens, &c.,) and the Greek fire above the
viith century, (see the Saluste du President des Brosses, tom. ii.
p. 381.) But their evidence, which precedes the vulgar aera of the
invention, is seldom clear or satisfactory, and subsequent writers
may be suspected of fraud or credulity. In the earliest sieges, some
combustibles of oil and sulphur have been used, and the Greek fire has
some affinities with gunpowder both in its nature and effects: for the
antiquity of the first, a passage of Procopius, (de Bell. Goth. l. iv.
c. 11,) for that of the second, some facts in the Arabic history of
Spain, (A.D. 1249, 1312, 1332. Bibliot. Arab. Hisp. tom. ii. p. 6, 7,
8,) are the most difficult to elude.]

[Footnote 24: That extraordinary man, Friar Bacon, reveals two of the
ingredients, saltpetre and sulphur, and conceals the third in a sentence
of mysterious gibberish, as if he dreaded the consequences of his own
discovery, (Biog. Brit. vol. i. p. 430, new edition.)]
