## Chapter XLII: State Of The Barbaric World.--Part IV.

It was the boast of the Colchians, that their ancestors had checked
the victories of Sesostris; and the defeat of the Egyptian is less
incredible than his successful progress as far as the foot of Mount
Caucasus. They sunk without any memorable effort, under the arms of
Cyrus; followed in distant wars the standard of the great king, and
presented him every fifth year with one hundred boys, and as many
virgins, the fairest produce of the land. [76] Yet he accepted this gift
like the gold and ebony of India, the frankincense of the Arabs, or the
negroes and ivory of Aethiopia: the Colchians were not subject to the
dominion of a satrap, and they continued to enjoy the name as well as
substance of national independence. [77] After the fall of the Persian
empire, Mithridates, king of Pontus, added Colchos to the wide circle
of his dominions on the Euxine; and when the natives presumed to request
that his son might reign over them, he bound the ambitious youth in
chains of gold, and delegated a servant in his place. In pursuit of
Mithridates, the Romans advanced to the banks of the Phasis, and their
galleys ascended the river till they reached the camp of Pompey and his
legions. [78] But the senate, and afterwards the emperors, disdained to
reduce that distant and useless conquest into the form of a province.
The family of a Greek rhetorician was permitted to reign in Colchos and
the adjacent kingdoms from the time of Mark Antony to that of Nero; and
after the race of Polemo [79] was extinct, the eastern Pontus, which
preserved his name, extended no farther than the neighborhood of
Trebizond. Beyond these limits the fortifications of Hyssus, of Apsarus,
of the Phasis, of Dioscurias or Sebastopolis, and of Pityus, were
guarded by sufficient detachments of horse and foot; and six princes of
Colchos received their diadems from the lieutenants of Caesar. One of
these lieutenants, the eloquent and philosophic Arrian, surveyed,
and has described, the Euxine coast, under the reign of Hadrian. The
garrison which he reviewed at the mouth of the Phasis consisted of
four hundred chosen legionaries; the brick walls and towers, the double
ditch, and the military engines on the rampart, rendered this place
inaccessible to the Barbarians: but the new suburbs which had been built
by the merchants and veterans, required, in the opinion of Arrian,
some external defence. [80] As the strength of the empire was gradually
impaired, the Romans stationed on the Phasis were neither withdrawn
nor expelled; and the tribe of the Lazi, [81] whose posterity speak a
foreign dialect, and inhabit the sea coast of Trebizond, imposed their
name and dominion on the ancient kingdom of Colchos. Their independence
was soon invaded by a formidable neighbor, who had acquired, by arms
and treaties, the sovereignty of Iberia. The dependent king of Lazica
received his sceptre at the hands of the Persian monarch, and the
successors of Constantine acquiesced in this injurious claim, which was
proudly urged as a right of immemorial prescription. In the beginning of
the sixth century, their influence was restored by the introduction of
Christianity, which the Mingrelians still profess with becoming zeal,
without understanding the doctrines, or observing the precepts, of their
religion. After the decease of his father, Zathus was exalted to the
regal dignity by the favor of the great king; but the pious youth
abhorred the ceremonies of the Magi, and sought, in the palace of
Constantinople, an orthodox baptism, a noble wife, and the alliance of
the emperor Justin. The king of Lazica was solemnly invested with the
diadem, and his cloak and tunic of white silk, with a gold border,
displayed, in rich embroidery, the figure of his new patron; who soothed
the jealousy of the Persian court, and excused the revolt of Colchos, by
the venerable names of hospitality and religion. The common interest of
both empires imposed on the Colchians the duty of guarding the passes
of Mount Caucasus, where a wall of sixty miles is now defended by the
monthly service of the musketeers of Mingrelia. [82]

Justinian, (de Edif. l. iv. c. 7.)]

[Footnote 81: In the time of Pliny, Arrian, and Ptolemy, the Lazi were
a particular tribe on the northern skirts of Colchos, (Cellarius,
Geograph. Antiq. tom. ii. p. 222.) In the age of Justinian, they spread,
or at least reigned, over the whole country. At present, they have
migrated along the coast towards Trebizond, and compose a rude
sea-faring people, with a peculiar language, (Chardin, p. 149. Peyssonel
p. 64.)]

[Footnote 82: John Malala, Chron. tom. ii. p. 134--137 Theophanes, p.
144. Hist. Miscell. l. xv. p. 103. The fact is authentic, but the
date seems too recent. In speaking of their Persian alliance, the Lazi
contemporaries of Justinian employ the most obsolete words, &c. Could
they belong to a connection which had not been dissolved above twenty
years?]

But this honorable connection was soon corrupted by the avarice and
ambition of the Romans. Degraded from the rank of allies, the Lazi were
incessantly reminded, by words and actions, of their dependent state.
At the distance of a day's journey beyond the Apsarus, they beheld the
rising fortress of Petra, [83] which commanded the maritime country
to the south of the Phasis. Instead of being protected by the valor,
Colchos was insulted by the licentiousness, of foreign mercenaries; the
benefits of commerce were converted into base and vexatious monopoly;
and Gubazes, the native prince, was reduced to a pageant of royalty,
by the superior influence of the officers of Justinian. Disappointed in
their expectations of Christian virtue, the indignant Lazi reposed some
confidence in the justice of an unbeliever. After a private assurance
that their ambassadors should not be delivered to the Romans, they
publicly solicited the friendship and aid of Chosroes. The sagacious
monarch instantly discerned the use and importance of Colchos; and
meditated a plan of conquest, which was renewed at the end of a thousand
years by Shah Abbas, the wisest and most powerful of his successors.
[84] His ambition was fired by the hope of launching a Persian navy from
the Phasis, of commanding the trade and navigation of the Euxine Sea, of
desolating the coast of Pontus and Bithynia, of distressing, perhaps of
attacking, Constantinople, and of persuading the Barbarians of Europe to
second his arms and counsels against the common enemy of mankind.

Under the pretence of a Scythian war, he silently led his troops to the
frontiers of Iberia; the Colchian guides were prepared to conduct them
through the woods and along the precipices of Mount Caucasus; and a
narrow path was laboriously formed into a safe and spacious highway, for
the march of cavalry, and even of elephants. Gubazes laid his person
and diadem at the feet of the king of Persia; his Colchians imitated
the submission of their prince; and after the walls of Petra had been
shaken, the Roman garrison prevented, by a capitulation, the impending
fury of the last assault. But the Lazi soon discovered, that their
impatience had urged them to choose an evil more intolerable than the
calamities which they strove to escape. The monopoly of salt and corn
was effectually removed by the loss of those valuable commodities.
The authority of a Roman legislator, was succeeded by the pride of an
Oriental despot, who beheld, with equal disdain, the slaves whom he had
exalted, and the kings whom he had humbled before the footstool of his
throne. The adoration of fire was introduced into Colchos by the zeal
of the Magi: their intolerant spirit provoked the fervor of a Christian
people; and the prejudice of nature or education was wounded by the
impious practice of exposing the dead bodies of their parents, on the
summit of a lofty tower, to the crows and vultures of the air. [85]
Conscious of the increasing hatred, which retarded the execution of
his great designs, the just Nashirvan had secretly given orders to
assassinate the king of the Lazi, to transplant the people into some
distant land, and to fix a faithful and warlike colony on the banks of
the Phasis. The watchful jealousy of the Colchians foresaw and averted
the approaching ruin. Their repentance was accepted at Constantinople
by the prudence, rather than clemency, of Justinian; and he commanded
Dagisteus, with seven thousand Romans, and one thousand of the Zani,
[8511] to expel the Persians from the coast of the Euxine.

[Footnote 83: The sole vestige of Petra subsists in the writings of
Procopius and Agathias. Most of the towns and castles of Lazica may be
found by comparing their names and position with the map of Mingrelia,
in Lamberti.]

[Footnote 84: See the amusing letters of Pietro della Valle, the Roman
traveler, (Viaggi, tom. ii. 207, 209, 213, 215, 266, 286, 300, tom. iii.
p. 54, 127.) In the years 1618, 1619, and 1620, he conversed with Shah
Abbas, and strongly encouraged a design which might have united Persia
and Europe against their common enemy the Turk.]

[Footnote 85: See Herodotus, (l. i. c. 140, p. 69,) who speaks with
diffidence, Larcher, (tom. i. p. 399--401, Notes sur Herodote,)
Procopius, (Persic. l. i. c. 11,) and Agathias, (l. ii. p. 61, 62.) This
practice, agreeable to the Zendavesta, (Hyde, de Relig. Pers. c. 34, p.
414--421,) demonstrates that the burial of the Persian kings, (Xenophon,
Cyropaed. l. viii. p. 658,) is a Greek fiction, and that their tombs
could be no more than cenotaphs.]

[Footnote 8511: These seem the same people called Suanians, p. 328.--M.]

The siege of Petra, which the Roman general, with the aid of the Lazi,
immediately undertook, is one of the most remarkable actions of the
age. The city was seated on a craggy rock, which hung over the sea,
and communicated by a steep and narrow path with the land. Since the
approach was difficult, the attack might be deemed impossible: the
Persian conqueror had strengthened the fortifications of Justinian; and
the places least inaccessible were covered by additional bulwarks.
In this important fortress, the vigilance of Chosroes had deposited a
magazine of offensive and defensive arms, sufficient for five times the
number, not only of the garrison, but of the besiegers themselves. The
stock of flour and salt provisions was adequate to the consumption of
five years; the want of wine was supplied by vinegar; and of grain from
whence a strong liquor was extracted, and a triple aqueduct eluded
the diligence, and even the suspicions, of the enemy. But the firmest
defence of Petra was placed in the valor of fifteen hundred Persians,
who resisted the assaults of the Romans, whilst, in a softer vein of
earth, a mine was secretly perforated. The wall, supported by slender
and temporary props, hung tottering in the air; but Dagisteus delayed
the attack till he had secured a specific recompense; and the town was
relieved before the return of his messenger from Constantinople. The
Persian garrison was reduced to four hundred men, of whom no more than
fifty were exempt from sickness or wounds; yet such had been their
inflexible perseverance, that they concealed their losses from the
enemy, by enduring, without a murmur, the sight and putrefying stench
of the dead bodies of their eleven hundred companions. After their
deliverance, the breaches were hastily stopped with sand-bags; the
mine was replenished with earth; a new wall was erected on a frame
of substantial timber; and a fresh garrison of three thousand men
was stationed at Petra to sustain the labors of a second siege. The
operations, both of the attack and defence, were conducted with skilful
obstinacy; and each party derived useful lessons from the experience of
their past faults. A battering-ram was invented, of light construction
and powerful effect: it was transported and worked by the hands of forty
soldiers; and as the stones were loosened by its repeated strokes, they
were torn with long iron hooks from the wall. From those walls, a shower
of darts was incessantly poured on the heads of the assailants; but
they were most dangerously annoyed by a fiery composition of sulphur and
bitumen, which in Colchos might with some propriety be named the oil
of Medea. Of six thousand Romans who mounted the scaling-ladders, their
general Bessas was the first, a gallant veteran of seventy years of age:
the courage of their leader, his fall, and extreme danger, animated
the irresistible effort of his troops; and their prevailing numbers
oppressed the strength, without subduing the spirit, of the Persian
garrison. The fate of these valiant men deserves to be more distinctly
noticed. Seven hundred had perished in the siege, two thousand three
hundred survived to defend the breach. One thousand and seventy were
destroyed with fire and sword in the last assault; and if seven hundred
and thirty were made prisoners, only eighteen among them were found
without the marks of honorable wounds. The remaining five hundred
escaped into the citadel, which they maintained without any hopes of
relief, rejecting the fairest terms of capitulation and service, till
they were lost in the flames. They died in obedience to the commands of
their prince; and such examples of loyalty and valor might excite their
countrymen to deeds of equal despair and more prosperous event. The
instant demolition of the works of Petra confessed the astonishment and
apprehension of the conqueror. A Spartan would have praised and pitied
the virtue of these heroic slaves; but the tedious warfare and alternate
success of the Roman and Persian arms cannot detain the attention of
posterity at the foot of Mount Caucasus. The advantages obtained by the
troops of Justinian were more frequent and splendid; but the forces of
the great king were continually supplied, till they amounted to eight
elephants and seventy thousand men, including twelve thousand Scythian
allies, and above three thousand Dilemites, who descended by their free
choice from the hills of Hyrcania, and were equally formidable in close
or in distant combat. The siege of Archaeopolis, a name imposed or
corrupted by the Greeks, was raised with some loss and precipitation;
but the Persians occupied the passes of Iberia: Colchos was enslaved by
their forts and garrisons; they devoured the scanty sustenance of the
people; and the prince of the Lazi fled into the mountains. In the Roman
camp, faith and discipline were unknown; and the independent leaders,
who were invested with equal power, disputed with each other the
preeminence of vice and corruption. The Persians followed, without
a murmur, the commands of a single chief, who implicitly obeyed the
instructions of their supreme lord. Their general was distinguished
among the heroes of the East by his wisdom in council, and his valor in
the field. The advanced age of Mermeroes, and the lameness of both his
feet, could not diminish the activity of his mind, or even of his
body; and, whilst he was carried in a litter in the front of battle, he
inspired terror to the enemy, and a just confidence to the troops, who,
under his banners, were always successful. After his death, the command
devolved to Nacoragan, a proud satrap, who, in a conference with the
Imperial chiefs, had presumed to declare that he disposed of victory
as absolutely as of the ring on his finger. Such presumption was the
natural cause and forerunner of a shameful defeat. The Romans had been
gradually repulsed to the edge of the sea-shore; and their last camp, on
the ruins of the Grecian colony of Phasis, was defended on all sides
by strong intrenchments, the river, the Euxine, and a fleet of galleys.
Despair united their counsels and invigorated their arms: they withstood
the assault of the Persians and the flight of Nacoragan preceded or
followed the slaughter of ten thousand of his bravest soldiers. He
escaped from the Romans to fall into the hands of an unforgiving master
who severely chastised the error of his own choice: the unfortunate
general was flayed alive, and his skin, stuffed into the human form, was
exposed on a mountain; a dreadful warning to those who might hereafter
be intrusted with the fame and fortune of Persia. [86] Yet the prudence
of Chosroes insensibly relinquished the prosecution of the Colchian war,
in the just persuasion, that it is impossible to reduce, or, at
least, to hold a distant country against the wishes and efforts of its
inhabitants. The fidelity of Gubazes sustained the most rigorous trials.
He patiently endured the hardships of a savage life, and rejected with
disdain, the specious temptations of the Persian court. [8611] The king
of the Lazi had been educated in the Christian religion; his mother was
the daughter of a senator; during his youth he had served ten years a
silentiary of the Byzantine palace, [87] and the arrears of an unpaid
salary were a motive of attachment as well as of complaint. But the long
continuance of his sufferings extorted from him a naked representation
of the truth; and truth was an unpardonable libel on the lieutenants
of Justinian, who, amidst the delays of a ruinous war, had spared
his enemies and trampled on his allies. Their malicious information
persuaded the emperor that his faithless vassal already meditated
a second defection: an order was surprised to send him prisoner to
Constantinople; a treacherous clause was inserted, that he might be
lawfully killed in case of resistance; and Gubazes, without arms,
or suspicion of danger, was stabbed in the security of a friendly
interview. In the first moments of rage and despair, the Colchians
would have sacrificed their country and religion to the gratification
of revenge. But the authority and eloquence of the wiser few obtained
a salutary pause: the victory of the Phasis restored the terror of the
Roman arms, and the emperor was solicitous to absolve his own name
from the imputation of so foul a murder. A judge of senatorial rank was
commissioned to inquire into the conduct and death of the king of the
Lazi. He ascended a stately tribunal, encompassed by the ministers
of justice and punishment: in the presence of both nations, this
extraordinary cause was pleaded, according to the forms of civil
jurisprudence, and some satisfaction was granted to an injured people,
by the sentence and execution of the meaner criminals. [88]

[Footnote 86: The punishment of flaying alive could not be introduced
into Persia by Sapor, (Brisson, de Regn. Pers. l. ii. p. 578,) nor could
it be copied from the foolish tale of Marsyas, the Phrygian piper, most
foolishly quoted as a precedent by Agathias, (l. iv. p. 132, 133.)]

[Footnote 8611: According to Agathias, the death of Gubazos preceded the
defeat of Nacoragan. The trial took place after the battle.--M.]

[Footnote 87: In the palace of Constantinople there were thirty
silentiaries, who were styled hastati, ante fores cubiculi, an honorable
title which conferred the rank, without imposing the duties, of a
senator, (Cod. Theodos. l. vi. tit. 23. Gothofred. Comment. tom. ii. p.
129.)]

[Footnote 88: On these judicial orations, Agathias (l. iii. p. 81-89, l.
iv. p. 108--119) lavishes eighteen or twenty pages of false and florid
rhetoric. His ignorance or carelessness overlooks the strongest argument
against the king of Lazica--his former revolt. * Note: The Orations in
the third book of Agathias are not judicial, nor delivered before the
Roman tribunal: it is a deliberative debate among the Colchians on
the expediency of adhering to the Roman, or embracing the Persian
alliance.--M.]

In peace, the king of Persia continually sought the pretences of a
rupture: but no sooner had he taken up arms, than he expressed his
desire of a safe and honorable treaty. During the fiercest hostilities,
the two monarchs entertained a deceitful negotiation; and such was the
superiority of Chosroes, that whilst he treated the Roman ministers with
insolence and contempt, he obtained the most unprecedented honors
for his own ambassadors at the Imperial court. The successor of Cyrus
assumed the majesty of the Eastern sun, and graciously permitted his
younger brother Justinian to reign over the West, with the pale and
reflected splendor of the moon. This gigantic style was supported by the
pomp and eloquence of Isdigune, one of the royal chamberlains. His wife
and daughters, with a train of eunuchs and camels, attended the march of
the ambassador: two satraps with golden diadems were numbered among his
followers: he was guarded by five hundred horse, the most valiant of the
Persians; and the Roman governor of Dara wisely refused to admit more
than twenty of this martial and hostile caravan. When Isdigune had
saluted the emperor, and delivered his presents, he passed ten months at
Constantinople without discussing any serious affairs. Instead of being
confined to his palace, and receiving food and water from the hands
of his keepers, the Persian ambassador, without spies or guards, was
allowed to visit the capital; and the freedom of conversation and
trade enjoyed by his domestics, offended the prejudices of an age which
rigorously practised the law of nations, without confidence or courtesy.
[89] By an unexampled indulgence, his interpreter, a servant below the
notice of a Roman magistrate, was seated, at the table of Justinian,
by the side of his master: and one thousand pounds of gold might be
assigned for the expense of his journey and entertainment. Yet the
repeated labors of Isdigune could procure only a partial and imperfect
truce, which was always purchased with the treasures, and renewed at the
solicitation, of the Byzantine court Many years of fruitless desolation
elapsed before Justinian and Chosroes were compelled, by mutual
lassitude, to consult the repose of their declining age. At a conference
held on the frontier, each party, without expecting to gain credit,
displayed the power, the justice, and the pacific intentions, of their
respective sovereigns; but necessity and interest dictated the treaty
of peace, which was concluded for a term of fifty years, diligently
composed in the Greek and Persian languages, and attested by the seals
of twelve interpreters. The liberty of commerce and religion was fixed
and defined; the allies of the emperor and the great king were
included in the same benefits and obligations; and the most scrupulous
precautions were provided to prevent or determine the accidental
disputes that might arise on the confines of two hostile nations. After
twenty years of destructive though feeble war, the limits still remained
without alteration; and Chosroes was persuaded to renounce his dangerous
claim to the possession or sovereignty of Colchos and its dependent
states. Rich in the accumulated treasures of the East, he extorted from
the Romans an annual payment of thirty thousand pieces of gold; and the
smallness of the sum revealed the disgrace of a tribute in its naked
deformity. In a previous debate, the chariot of Sesostris, and the
wheel of fortune, were applied by one of the ministers of Justinian,
who observed that the reduction of Antioch, and some Syrian cities, had
elevated beyond measure the vain and ambitious spirit of the Barbarian.
"You are mistaken," replied the modest Persian: "the king of kings, the
lord of mankind, looks down with contempt on such petty acquisitions;
and of the ten nations, vanquished by his invincible arms, he esteems
the Romans as the least formidable." [90] According to the Orientals,
the empire of Nushirvan extended from Ferganah, in Transoxiana, to
Yemen or Arabia Faelix. He subdued the rebels of Hyrcania, reduced the
provinces of Cabul and Zablestan on the banks of the Indus, broke the
power of the Euthalites, terminated by an honorable treaty the Turkish
war, and admitted the daughter of the great khan into the number of his
lawful wives. Victorious and respected among the princes of Asia, he
gave audience, in his palace of Madain, or Ctesiphon, to the ambassadors
of the world. Their gifts or tributes, arms, rich garments, gems, slaves
or aromatics, were humbly presented at the foot of his throne; and he
condescended to accept from the king of India ten quintals of the wood
of aloes, a maid seven cubits in height, and a carpet softer than silk,
the skin, as it was reported, of an extraordinary serpent. [91]

Justinian had been reproached for his alliance with the Aethiopians, as
if he attempted to introduce a people of savage negroes into the system
of civilized society. But the friends of the Roman empire, the Axumites,
or Abyssinians, may be always distinguished from the original natives of
Africa. [92] The hand of nature has flattened the noses of the negroes,
covered their heads with shaggy wool, and tinged their skin with
inherent and indelible blackness. But the olive complexion of the
Abyssinians, their hair, shape, and features, distinctly mark them as
a colony of Arabs; and this descent is confirmed by the resemblance of
language and manners the report of an ancient emigration, and the narrow
interval between the shores of the Red Sea. Christianity had raised that
nation above the level of African barbarism: [93] their intercourse
with Egypt, and the successors of Constantine, [94] had communicated the
rudiments of the arts and sciences; their vessels traded to the Isle of
Ceylon, [95] and seven kingdoms obeyed the Negus or supreme prince of
Abyssinia. The independence of the Homerites, [9511] who reigned in the
rich and happy Arabia, was first violated by an Aethiopian conqueror: he
drew his hereditary claim from the queen of Sheba, [96] and his ambition
was sanctified by religious zeal. The Jews, powerful and active in
exile, had seduced the mind of Dunaan, prince of the Homerites. They
urged him to retaliate the persecution inflicted by the Imperial laws
on their unfortunate brethren: some Roman merchants were injuriously
treated; and several Christians of Negra [97] were honored with the
crown of martyrdom. [98] The churches of Arabia implored the protection
of the Abyssinian monarch. The Negus passed the Red Sea with a fleet
and army, deprived the Jewish proselyte of his kingdom and life, and
extinguished a race of princes, who had ruled above two thousand
years the sequestered region of myrrh and frankincense. The conqueror
immediately announced the victory of the gospel, requested an orthodox
patriarch, and so warmly professed his friendship to the Roman empire,
that Justinian was flattered by the hope of diverting the silk trade
through the channel of Abyssinia, and of exciting the forces of
Arabia against the Persian king. Nonnosus, descended from a family
of ambassadors, was named by the emperor to execute this important
commission. He wisely declined the shorter, but more dangerous, road,
through the sandy deserts of Nubia; ascended the Nile, embarked on the
Red Sea, and safely landed at the African port of Adulis. From Adulis to
the royal city of Axume is no more than fifty leagues, in a direct line;
but the winding passes of the mountains detained the ambassador fifteen
days; and as he traversed the forests, he saw, and vaguely computed,
about five thousand wild elephants. The capital, according to his
report, was large and populous; and the village of Axume is still
conspicuous by the regal coronations, by the ruins of a Christian
temple, and by sixteen or seventeen obelisks inscribed with Grecian
characters. [99] But the Negus [9911] gave audience in the open field,
seated on a lofty chariot, which was drawn by four elephants, superbly
caparisoned, and surrounded by his nobles and musicians. He was clad in
a linen garment and cap, holding in his hand two javelins and a
light shield; and, although his nakedness was imperfectly covered, he
displayed the Barbaric pomp of gold chains, collars, and bracelets,
richly adorned with pearls and precious stones. The ambassador of
Justinian knelt; the Negus raised him from the ground, embraced
Nonnosus, kissed the seal, perused the letter, accepted the Roman
alliance, and, brandishing his weapons, denounced implacable war against
the worshipers of fire. But the proposal of the silk trade was eluded;
and notwithstanding the assurances, and perhaps the wishes, of the
Abyssinians, these hostile menaces evaporated without effect. The
Homerites were unwilling to abandon their aromatic groves, to explore a
sandy desert, and to encounter, after all their fatigues, a formidable
nation from whom they had never received any personal injuries. Instead
of enlarging his conquests, the king of Aethiopia was incapable of
defending his possessions. Abrahah, [9912] the slave of a Roman merchant
of Adulis, assumed the sceptre of the Homerites,; the troops of Africa
were seduced by the luxury of the climate; and Justinian solicited
the friendship of the usurper, who honored with a slight tribute the
supremacy of his prince. After a long series of prosperity, the power of
Abrahah was overthrown before the gates of Mecca; and his children were
despoiled by the Persian conqueror; and the Aethiopians were finally
expelled from the continent of Asia. This narrative of obscure and
remote events is not foreign to the decline and fall of the Roman
empire. If a Christian power had been maintained in Arabia, Mahomet must
have been crushed in his cradle, and Abyssinia would have prevented a
revolution which has changed the civil and religious state of the world.

Abyssinia, will justify the suspicion, that race, as well as climate,
must have contributed to form the negroes of the adjacent and similar
regions. * Note: Mr. Salt (Travels, vol. ii. p. 458) considers them
to be distinct from the Arabs--"in feature, color, habit, and
manners."--M.]

[Footnote 93: The Portuguese missionaries, Alvarez, (Ramusio, tom. i.
fol. 204, rect. 274, vers.) Bermudez, (Purchas's Pilgrims, vol. ii. l.
v. c. 7, p. 1149--1188,) Lobo, (Relation, &c., par M. le Grand, with
xv. Dissertations, Paris, 1728,) and Tellez (Relations de Thevenot,
part iv.) could only relate of modern Abyssinia what they had seen or
invented. The erudition of Ludolphus, (Hist. Aethiopica, Francofurt,
1681. Commentarius, 1691. Appendix, 1694,) in twenty-five languages,
could add little concerning its ancient history. Yet the fame of Caled,
or Ellisthaeus, the conqueror of Yemen, is celebrated in national songs
and legends.]

[Footnote 94: The negotiations of Justinian with the Axumites, or
Aethiopians, are recorded by Procopius (Persic. l. i. c. 19, 20) and
John Malala, (tom. ii. p. 163--165, 193--196.) The historian of Antioch
quotes the original narrative of the ambassador Nonnosus, of which
Photius (Bibliot. Cod. iii.) has preserved a curious extract.]

[Footnote 95: The trade of the Axumites to the coast of India and
Africa, and the Isle of Ceylon, is curiously represented by Cosmas
Indicopleustes, (Topograph. Christian. l. ii. p. 132, 138, 139, 140, l.
xi. p. 338, 339.)]

[Footnote 9511: It appears by the important inscription discovered
by Mr. Salt at Axoum, and from a law of Constantius, (16th Jan. 356,
inserted in the Theodosian Code, l. 12, c. 12,) that in the middle of
the fourth century of our era the princes of the Axumites joined to
their titles that of king of the Homerites. The conquests which they
made over the Arabs in the sixth century were only a restoration of the
ancient order of things. St. Martin vol. viii. p. 46--M.]

[Footnote 96: Ludolph. Hist. et Comment. Aethiop. l. ii. c. 3.]

[Footnote 97: The city of Negra, or Nag'ran, in Yemen, is surrounded
with palm-trees, and stands in the high road between Saana, the capital,
and Mecca; from the former ten, from the latter twenty days' journey of
a caravan of camels, (Abulfeda, Descript. Arabiae, p. 52.)]

[Footnote 98: The martyrdom of St. Arethas, prince of Negra, and his
three hundred and forty companions, is embellished in the legends of
Metaphrastes and Nicephorus Callistus, copied by Baronius, (A. D 522,
No. 22--66, A.D. 523, No. 16--29,) and refuted with obscure diligence,
by Basnage, (Hist. des Juifs, tom. viii. l. xii. c. ii. p. 333--348,)
who investigates the state of the Jews in Arabia and Aethiopia. * Note:
According to Johannsen, (Hist. Yemanae, Praef. p. 89,) Dunaan (Ds Nowas)
massacred 20,000 Christians, and threw them into a pit, where they were
burned. They are called in the Koran the companions of the pit (socii
foveae.)--M.]

[Footnote 99: Alvarez (in Ramusio, tom. i. fol. 219, vers. 221, vers.)
saw the flourishing state of Axume in the year 1520--luogomolto buono
e grande. It was ruined in the same century by the Turkish invasion.
No more than 100 houses remain; but the memory of its past greatness is
preserved by the regal coronation, (Ludolph. Hist. et Comment. l. ii. c.
11.) * Note: Lord Valentia's and Mr. Salt's Travels give a high notion
of the ruins of Axum.--M.]

[Footnote 9911: The Negus is differently called Elesbaan, Elesboas,
Elisthaeus, probably the same name, or rather appellation. See St.
Martin, vol. viii. p. 49.--M.]

[Footnote 9912: According to the Arabian authorities, (Johannsen, Hist.
Yemanae, p. 94, Bonn, 1828,) Abrahah was an Abyssinian, the rival of
Ariathus, the brother of the Abyssinian king: he surprised and slew
Ariathus, and by his craft appeased the resentment of Nadjash, the
Abyssinian king. Abrahah was a Christian; he built a magnificent church
at Sana, and dissuaded his subjects from their accustomed pilgrimages to
Mecca. The church was defiled, it was supposed, by the Koreishites, and
Abrahah took up arms to revenge himself on the temple at Mecca. He was
repelled by miracle: his elephant would not advance, but knelt down
before the sacred place; Abrahah fled, discomfited and mortally wounded,
to Sana--M.]

[Footnote 100: The revolutions of Yemen in the sixth century must be
collected from Procopius, (Persic. l. i. c. 19, 20,) Theophanes Byzant.,
(apud Phot. cod. lxiii. p. 80,) St. Theophanes, (in Chronograph. p.
144, 145, 188, 189, 206, 207, who is full of strange blunders,) Pocock,
(Specimen Hist. Arab. p. 62, 65,) D'Herbelot, (Bibliot. Orientale, p.
12, 477,) and Sale's Preliminary Discourse and Koran, (c. 105.) The
revolt of Abrahah is mentioned by Procopius; and his fall, though
clouded with miracles, is an historical fact. Note: To the authors
who have illustrated the obscure history of the Jewish and Abyssinian
kingdoms in Homeritis may be added Schultens, Hist. Joctanidarum; Walch,
Historia rerum in Homerite gestarum, in the 4th vol. of the Gottingen
Transactions; Salt's Travels, vol. ii. p. 446, &c.: Sylvestre de Sacy,
vol. i. Acad. des Inscrip. Jost, Geschichte der Israeliter; Johannsen,
Hist. Yemanae; St. Martin's notes to Le Beau, t. vii p. 42.--M.]

[Footnote 1001: A period of sixty-seven years is assigned by most of the
Arabian authorities to the Abyssinian kingdoms in Homeritis.--M.]
