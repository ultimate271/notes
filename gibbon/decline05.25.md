## Chapter LII: More Conquests By The Arabs.--Part IV.

Under the reign of Almamon at Bagdad, of Michael the Stammerer at
Constantinople, the islands of Crete [79] and Sicily were subdued by the
Arabs. The former of these conquests is disdained by their own writers,
who were ignorant of the fame of Jupiter and Minos, but it has not been
overlooked by the Byzantine historians, who now begin to cast a clearer
light on the affairs of their own times. [80] A band of Andalusian
volunteers, discontented with the climate or government of Spain,
explored the adventures of the sea; but as they sailed in no more than
ten or twenty galleys, their warfare must be branded with the name of
piracy. As the subjects and sectaries of the white party, they might
lawfully invade the dominions of the black caliphs. A rebellious faction
introduced them into Alexandria; [81] they cut in pieces both friends
and foes, pillaged the churches and the moschs, sold above six thousand
Christian captives, and maintained their station in the capital of
Egypt, till they were oppressed by the forces and the presence of
Almamon himself. From the mouth of the Nile to the Hellespont, the
islands and sea-coasts both of the Greeks and Moslems were exposed to
their depredations; they saw, they envied, they tasted the fertility of
Crete, and soon returned with forty galleys to a more serious attack.
The Andalusians wandered over the land fearless and unmolested; but when
they descended with their plunder to the sea-shore, their vessels were
in flames, and their chief, Abu Caab, confessed himself the author of
the mischief. Their clamors accused his madness or treachery. "Of what
do you complain?" replied the crafty emir. "I have brought you to a land
flowing with milk and honey. Here is your true country; repose from your
toils, and forget the barren place of your nativity." "And our wives and
children?" "Your beauteous captives will supply the place of your
wives, and in their embraces you will soon become the fathers of a new
progeny." The first habitation was their camp, with a ditch and rampart,
in the Bay of Suda; but an apostate monk led them to a more desirable
position in the eastern parts; and the name of Candax, their fortress
and colony, has been extended to the whole island, under the corrupt
and modern appellation of Candia. The hundred cities of the age of
Minos were diminished to thirty; and of these, only one, most probably
Cydonia, had courage to retain the substance of freedom and the
profession of Christianity. The Saracens of Crete soon repaired the loss
of their navy; and the timbers of Mount Ida were launched into the
main. During a hostile period of one hundred and thirty-eight years,
the princes of Constantinople attacked these licentious corsairs with
fruitless curses and ineffectual arms.

[Footnote 79: The authors from whom I have learned the most of the
ancient and modern state of Crete, are Belon, (Observations, &c., c.
3-20, Paris, 1555,) Tournefort, (Voyage du Levant, tom. i. lettre ii.
et iii.,) and Meursius, (Creta, in his works, tom. iii. p. 343-544.)
Although Crete is styled by Homer, by Dionysius, I cannot conceive
that mountainous island to surpass, or even to equal, in fertility the
greater part of Spain.]

[Footnote 80: The most authentic and circumstantial intelligence is
obtained from the four books of the Continuation of Theophanes, compiled
by the pen or the command of Constantine Porphyrogenitus, with the Life
of his father Basil, the Macedonian, (Scriptores post Theophanem, p.
1-162, a Francisc. Combefis, Paris, 1685.) The loss of Crete and Sicily
is related, l. ii. p. 46-52. To these we may add the secondary evidence
of Joseph Genesius, (l. ii. p. 21, Venet. 1733,) George Cedrenus,
(Compend. p. 506-508,) and John Scylitzes Curopalata, (apud Baron.
Annal. Eccles. A.D. 827, No. 24, &c.) But the modern Greeks are such
notorious plagiaries, that I should only quote a plurality of names.]

[Footnote 81: Renaudot (Hist. Patriarch. Alex. p. 251-256, 268-270) had
described the ravages of the Andalusian Arabs in Egypt, but has forgot
to connect them with the conquest of Crete.]

The loss of Sicily [82] was occasioned by an act of superstitious rigor.
An amorous youth, who had stolen a nun from her cloister, was sentenced
by the emperor to the amputation of his tongue. Euphemius appealed to
the reason and policy of the Saracens of Africa; and soon returned with
the Imperial purple, a fleet of one hundred ships, and an army of seven
hundred horse and ten thousand foot. They landed at Mazara near the
ruins of the ancient Selinus; but after some partial victories, Syracuse
[83] was delivered by the Greeks, the apostate was slain before her
walls, and his African friends were reduced to the necessity of feeding
on the flesh of their own horses. In their turn they were relieved by a
powerful reenforcement of their brethren of Andalusia; the largest and
western part of the island was gradually reduced, and the commodious
harbor of Palermo was chosen for the seat of the naval and military
power of the Saracens. Syracuse preserved about fifty years the faith
which she had sworn to Christ and to Caesar. In the last and fatal
siege, her citizens displayed some remnant of the spirit which had
formerly resisted the powers of Athens and Carthage. They stood above
twenty days against the battering-rams and catapultoe, the mines and
tortoises of the besiegers; and the place might have been relieved,
if the mariners of the Imperial fleet had not been detained at
Constantinople in building a church to the Virgin Mary. The deacon
Theodosius, with the bishop and clergy, was dragged in chains from the
altar to Palermo, cast into a subterraneous dungeon, and exposed to
the hourly peril of death or apostasy. His pathetic, and not inelegant,
complaint may be read as the epitaph of his country. [84] From the Roman
conquest to this final calamity, Syracuse, now dwindled to the primitive
Isle of Ortygea, had insensibly declined. Yet the relics were still
precious; the plate of the cathedral weighed five thousand pounds of
silver; the entire spoil was computed at one million of pieces of gold,
(about four hundred thousand pounds sterling,) and the captives must
outnumber the seventeen thousand Christians, who were transported from
the sack of Tauromenium into African servitude. In Sicily, the religion
and language of the Greeks were eradicated; and such was the docility of
the rising generation, that fifteen thousand boys were circumcised and
clothed on the same day with the son of the Fatimite caliph. The Arabian
squadrons issued from the harbors of Palermo, Biserta, and Tunis; a
hundred and fifty towns of Calabria and Campania were attacked and
pillaged; nor could the suburbs of Rome be defended by the name of the
Caesars and apostles. Had the Mahometans been united, Italy must have
fallen an easy and glorious accession to the empire of the prophet.
But the caliphs of Bagdad had lost their authority in the West; the
Aglabites and Fatimites usurped the provinces of Africa, their emirs of
Sicily aspired to independence; and the design of conquest and dominion
was degraded to a repetition of predatory inroads. [85]

[Footnote 82: Theophanes, l. ii. p. 51. This history of the loss of
Sicily is no longer extant. Muratori (Annali d' Italia, tom. vii.
p. 719, 721, &c.) has added some circumstances from the Italian
chronicles.]

[Footnote 83: The splendid and interesting tragedy of Tancrede would
adapt itself much better to this epoch, than to the date (A.D. 1005)
which Voltaire himself has chosen. But I must gently reproach the poet
for infusing into the Greek subjects the spirit of modern knights and
ancient republicans.]

[Footnote 84: The narrative or lamentation of Theodosius is transcribed
and illustrated by Pagi, (Critica, tom. iii. p. 719, &c.) Constantine
Porphyrogenitus (in Vit. Basil, c. 69, 70, p. 190-192) mentions the
loss of Syracuse and the triumph of the demons.]

in Abulfeda, (Annal' Moslem. p. 271-273,) and in the first volume of
Muratori's Scriptores Rerum Italicarum. M. de Guignes (Hist. des Huns,
tom. i. p. 363, 364) has added some important facts.]

In the sufferings of prostrate Italy, the name of Rome awakens a solemn
and mournful recollection. A fleet of Saracens from the African coast
presumed to enter the mouth of the Tyber, and to approach a city which
even yet, in her fallen state, was revered as the metropolis of the
Christian world. The gates and ramparts were guarded by a trembling
people; but the tombs and temples of St. Peter and St. Paul were left
exposed in the suburbs of the Vatican and of the Ostian way. Their
invisible sanctity had protected them against the Goths, the Vandals,
and the Lombards; but the Arabs disdained both the gospel and the
legend; and their rapacious spirit was approved and animated by the
precepts of the Koran. The Christian idols were stripped of their costly
offerings; a silver altar was torn away from the shrine of St. Peter;
and if the bodies or the buildings were left entire, their deliverance
must be imputed to the haste, rather than the scruples, of the Saracens.
In their course along the Appian way, they pillaged Fundi and besieged
Gayeta; but they had turned aside from the walls of Rome, and by their
divisions, the Capitol was saved from the yoke of the prophet of Mecca.
The same danger still impended on the heads of the Roman people; and
their domestic force was unequal to the assault of an African emir. They
claimed the protection of their Latin sovereign; but the Carlovingian
standard was overthrown by a detachment of the Barbarians: they
meditated the restoration of the Greek emperors; but the attempt was
treasonable, and the succor remote and precarious. [86] Their distress
appeared to receive some aggravation from the death of their spiritual
and temporal chief; but the pressing emergency superseded the forms
and intrigues of an election; and the unanimous choice of Pope Leo the
Fourth [87] was the safety of the church and city. This pontiff was born
a Roman; the courage of the first ages of the republic glowed in his
breast; and, amidst the ruins of his country, he stood erect, like one
of the firm and lofty columns that rear their heads above the fragments
of the Roman forum. The first days of his reign were consecrated to the
purification and removal of relics, to prayers and processions, and to
all the solemn offices of religion, which served at least to heal the
imagination, and restore the hopes, of the multitude. The public defence
had been long neglected, not from the presumption of peace, but from the
distress and poverty of the times. As far as the scantiness of his means
and the shortness of his leisure would allow, the ancient walls were
repaired by the command of Leo; fifteen towers, in the most accessible
stations, were built or renewed; two of these commanded on either side
of the Tyber; and an iron chain was drawn across the stream to impede
the ascent of a hostile navy. The Romans were assured of a short respite
by the welcome news, that the siege of Gayeta had been raised, and that
a part of the enemy, with their sacrilegious plunder, had perished in
the waves.

[Footnote 86: One of the most eminent Romans (Gratianus, magister
militum et Romani palatii superista) was accused of declaring, Quia
Franci nihil nobis boni faciunt, neque adjutorium praebent, sed magis
quae nostra sunt violenter tollunt. Quare non advocamus Graecos, et cum
eis foedus pacis componentes, Francorum regem et gentem de nostro regno
et dominatione expellimus? Anastasius in Leone IV. p. 199.]

[Footnote 87: Voltaire (Hist. Generale, tom. ii. c. 38, p. 124) appears
to be remarkably struck with the character of Pope Leo IV. I have
borrowed his general expression, but the sight of the forum has
furnished me with a more distinct and lively image.]

But the storm, which had been delayed, soon burst upon them with
redoubled violence. The Aglabite, [88] who reigned in Africa, had
inherited from his father a treasure and an army: a fleet of Arabs and
Moors, after a short refreshment in the harbors of Sardinia, cast anchor
before the mouth of the Tyber, sixteen miles from the city: and their
discipline and numbers appeared to threaten, not a transient inroad, but
a serious design of conquest and dominion. But the vigilance of Leo had
formed an alliance with the vassals of the Greek empire, the free
and maritime states of Gayeta, Naples, and Amalfi; and in the hour of
danger, their galleys appeared in the port of Ostia under the command
of Caesarius, the son of the Neapolitan duke, a noble and valiant
youth, who had already vanquished the fleets of the Saracens. With his
principal companions, Caesarius was invited to the Lateran palace, and
the dexterous pontiff affected to inquire their errand, and to accept
with joy and surprise their providential succor. The city bands, in
arms, attended their father to Ostia, where he reviewed and blessed his
generous deliverers. They kissed his feet, received the communion with
martial devotion, and listened to the prayer of Leo, that the same God
who had supported St. Peter and St. Paul on the waves of the sea, would
strengthen the hands of his champions against the adversaries of his
holy name. After a similar prayer, and with equal resolution, the
Moslems advanced to the attack of the Christian galleys, which preserved
their advantageous station along the coast. The victory inclined to the
side of the allies, when it was less gloriously decided in their favor
by a sudden tempest, which confounded the skill and courage of the
stoutest mariners. The Christians were sheltered in a friendly harbor,
while the Africans were scattered and dashed in pieces among the rocks
and islands of a hostile shore. Those who escaped from shipwreck
and hunger neither found, nor deserved, mercy at the hands of their
implacable pursuers. The sword and the gibbet reduced the dangerous
multitude of captives; and the remainder was more usefully employed,
to restore the sacred edifices which they had attempted to subvert.
The pontiff, at the head of the citizens and allies, paid his grateful
devotion at the shrines of the apostles; and, among the spoils of this
naval victory, thirteen Arabian bows of pure and massy silver were
suspended round the altar of the fishermen of Galilee. The reign of Leo
the Fourth was employed in the defence and ornament of the Roman state.
The churches were renewed and embellished: near four thousand pounds
of silver were consecrated to repair the losses of St. Peter; and
his sanctuary was decorated with a plate of gold of the weight of two
hundred and sixteen pounds, embossed with the portraits of the pope
and emperor, and encircled with a string of pearls. Yet this vain
magnificence reflects less glory on the character of Leo than the
paternal care with which he rebuilt the walls of Horta and Ameria;
and transported the wandering inhabitants of Centumcellae to his new
foundation of Leopolis, twelve miles from the sea-shore. [89] By his
liberality, a colony of Corsicans, with their wives and children, was
planted in the station of Porto, at the mouth of the Tyber: the falling
city was restored for their use, the fields and vineyards were divided
among the new settlers: their first efforts were assisted by a gift of
horses and cattle; and the hardy exiles, who breathed revenge against
the Saracens, swore to live and die under the standard of St. Peter. The
nations of the West and North who visited the threshold of the apostles
had gradually formed the large and populous suburb of the Vatican, and
their various habitations were distinguished, in the language of the
times, as the schools of the Greeks and Goths, of the Lombards and
Saxons. But this venerable spot was still open to sacrilegious insult:
the design of enclosing it with walls and towers exhausted all that
authority could command, or charity would supply: and the pious labor
of four years was animated in every season, and at every hour, by the
presence of the indefatigable pontiff. The love of fame, a generous but
worldly passion, may be detected in the name of the Leonine city, which
he bestowed on the Vatican; yet the pride of the dedication was tempered
with Christian penance and humility. The boundary was trod by the bishop
and his clergy, barefoot, in sackcloth and ashes; the songs of triumph
were modulated to psalms and litanies; the walls were besprinkled with
holy water; and the ceremony was concluded with a prayer, that, under
the guardian care of the apostles and the angelic host, both the old and
the new Rome might ever be preserved pure, prosperous, and impregnable.

librarian of the Roman church. His Life of Leo IV, contains twenty-four
pages, (p. 175-199, edit. Paris;) and if a great part consist of
superstitious trifles, we must blame or command his hero, who was much
oftener in a church than in a camp.]

The emperor Theophilus, son of Michael the Stammerer, was one of the
most active and high-spirited princes who reigned at Constantinople
during the middle age. In offensive or defensive war, he marched in
person five times against the Saracens, formidable in his attack,
esteemed by the enemy in his losses and defeats. In the last of these
expeditions he penetrated into Syria, and besieged the obscure town of
Sozopetra; the casual birthplace of the caliph Motassem, whose father
Harun was attended in peace or war by the most favored of his wives and
concubines. The revolt of a Persian impostor employed at that moment the
arms of the Saracen, and he could only intercede in favor of a place for
which he felt and acknowledged some degree of filial affection. These
solicitations determined the emperor to wound his pride in so sensible a
part. Sozopetra was levelled with the ground, the Syrian prisoners were
marked or mutilated with ignominious cruelty, and a thousand female
captives were forced away from the adjacent territory. Among these a
matron of the house of Abbas invoked, in an agony of despair, the name
of Motassem; and the insults of the Greeks engaged the honor of her
kinsman to avenge his indignity, and to answer her appeal. Under the
reign of the two elder brothers, the inheritance of the youngest
had been confined to Anatolia, Armenia, Georgia, and Circassia; this
frontier station had exercised his military talents; and among his
accidental claims to the name of Octonary, [91] the most meritorious are
the eight battles which he gained or fought against the enemies of the
Koran. In this personal quarrel, the troops of Irak, Syria, and Egypt,
were recruited from the tribes of Arabia and the Turkish hordes; his
cavalry might be numerous, though we should deduct some myriads from the
hundred and thirty thousand horses of the royal stables; and the expense
of the armament was computed at four millions sterling, or one hundred
thousand pounds of gold. From Tarsus, the place of assembly,
the Saracens advanced in three divisions along the high road of
Constantinople: Motassem himself commanded the centre, and the vanguard
was given to his son Abbas, who, in the trial of the first adventures,
might succeed with the more glory, or fail with the least reproach. In
the revenge of his injury, the caliph prepared to retaliate a similar
affront. The father of Theophilus was a native of Amorium [92] in
Phrygia: the original seat of the Imperial house had been adorned with
privileges and monuments; and, whatever might be the indifference of the
people, Constantinople itself was scarcely of more value in the eyes of
the sovereign and his court. The name of Amorium was inscribed on the
shields of the Saracens; and their three armies were again united
under the walls of the devoted city. It had been proposed by the wisest
counsellors, to evacuate Amorium, to remove the inhabitants, and to
abandon the empty structures to the vain resentment of the Barbarians.
The emperor embraced the more generous resolution of defending, in a
siege and battle, the country of his ancestors. When the armies drew
near, the front of the Mahometan line appeared to a Roman eye more
closely planted with spears and javelins; but the event of the action
was not glorious on either side to the national troops. The Arabs were
broken, but it was by the swords of thirty thousand Persians, who had
obtained service and settlement in the Byzantine empire. The Greeks
were repulsed and vanquished, but it was by the arrows of the Turkish
cavalry; and had not their bowstrings been damped and relaxed by the
evening rain, very few of the Christians could have escaped with the
emperor from the field of battle. They breathed at Dorylaeum, at
the distance of three days; and Theophilus, reviewing his trembling
squadrons, forgave the common flight both of the prince and people.
After this discovery of his weakness, he vainly hoped to deprecate
the fate of Amorium: the inexorable caliph rejected with contempt his
prayers and promises; and detained the Roman ambassadors to be the
witnesses of his great revenge. They had nearly been the witnesses of
his shame. The vigorous assaults of fifty-five days were encountered by
a faithful governor, a veteran garrison, and a desperate people; and
the Saracens must have raised the siege, if a domestic traitor had not
pointed to the weakest part of the wall, a place which was decorated
with the statues of a lion and a bull. The vow of Motassem was
accomplished with unrelenting rigor: tired, rather than satiated,
with destruction, he returned to his new palace of Samara, in the
neighborhood of Bagdad, while the unfortunate [93] Theophilus implored
the tardy and doubtful aid of his Western rival the emperor of the
Franks. Yet in the siege of Amorium about seventy thousand Moslems
had perished: their loss had been revenged by the slaughter of thirty
thousand Christians, and the sufferings of an equal number of captives,
who were treated as the most atrocious criminals. Mutual necessity could
sometimes extort the exchange or ransom of prisoners: [94] but in the
national and religious conflict of the two empires, peace was without
confidence, and war without mercy. Quarter was seldom given in the
field; those who escaped the edge of the sword were condemned to
hopeless servitude, or exquisite torture; and a Catholic emperor
relates, with visible satisfaction, the execution of the Saracens of
Crete, who were flayed alive, or plunged into caldrons of boiling oil.
[95] To a point of honor Motassem had sacrificed a flourishing city, two
hundred thousand lives, and the property of millions. The same caliph
descended from his horse, and dirtied his robe, to relieve the distress
of a decrepit old man, who, with his laden ass, had tumbled into a
ditch. On which of these actions did he reflect with the most pleasure,
when he was summoned by the angel of death? [96]

[Footnote 91: The same number was applied to the following circumstance
in the life of Motassem: he was the eight of the Abbassides; he reigned
eight years, eight months, and eight days; left eight sons, eight
daughters, eight thousand slaves, eight millions of gold.]

[Footnote 92: Amorium is seldom mentioned by the old geographers, and
to tally forgotten in the Roman Itineraries. After the vith century,
it became an episcopal see, and at length the metropolis of the new
Galatia, (Carol. Scto. Paulo, Geograph. Sacra, p. 234.) The city rose
again from its ruins, if we should read Ammeria, not Anguria, in the
text of the Nubian geographer. (p. 236.)]

[Footnote 93: In the East he was styled, (Continuator Theophan. l. iii.
p. 84;) but such was the ignorance of the West, that his ambassadors,
in public discourse, might boldly narrate, de victoriis, quas adversus
exteras bellando gentes coelitus fuerat assecutus, (Annalist. Bertinian.
apud Pagi, tom. iii. p. 720.)]

[Footnote 94: Abulpharagius (Dynast. p. 167, 168) relates one of these
singular transactions on the bridge of the River Lamus in Cilicia, the
limit of the two empires, and one day's journey westward of Tarsus,
(D'Anville, Geographie Ancienne, tom. ii. p. 91.) Four thousand four
hundred and sixty Moslems, eight hundred women and children, one hundred
confederates, were exchanged for an equal number of Greeks. They passed
each other in the middle of the bridge, and when they reached their
respective friends, they shouted Allah Acbar, and Kyrie Eleison. Many of
the prisoners of Amorium were probably among them, but in the same year,
(A. H. 231,) the most illustrious of them, the forty two martyrs, were
beheaded by the caliph's order.]

[Footnote 95: Constantin. Porphyrogenitus, in Vit. Basil. c. 61, p. 186.
These Saracens were indeed treated with peculiar severity as pirates and
renegadoes.]

With Motassem, the eighth of the Abbassides, the glory of his family and
nation expired. When the Arabian conquerors had spread themselves over
the East, and were mingled with the servile crowds of Persia, Syria,
and Egypt, they insensibly lost the freeborn and martial virtues of the
desert. The courage of the South is the artificial fruit of discipline
and prejudice; the active power of enthusiasm had decayed, and the
mercenary forces of the caliphs were recruited in those climates of the
North, of which valor is the hardy and spontaneous production. Of the
Turks [97] who dwelt beyond the Oxus and Jaxartes, the robust youths,
either taken in war or purchased in trade, were educated in the
exercises of the field, and the profession of the Mahometan faith. The
Turkish guards stood in arms round the throne of their benefactor,
and their chiefs usurped the dominion of the palace and the provinces.
Motassem, the first author of this dangerous example, introduced
into the capital above fifty thousand Turks: their licentious conduct
provoked the public indignation, and the quarrels of the soldiers and
people induced the caliph to retire from Bagdad, and establish his
own residence and the camp of his Barbarian favorites at Samara on
the Tigris, about twelve leagues above the city of Peace. [98] His son
Motawakkel was a jealous and cruel tyrant: odious to his subjects, he
cast himself on the fidelity of the strangers, and these strangers,
ambitious and apprehensive, were tempted by the rich promise of a
revolution. At the instigation, or at least in the cause of his son,
they burst into his apartment at the hour of supper, and the caliph
was cut into seven pieces by the same swords which he had recently
distributed among the guards of his life and throne. To this throne, yet
streaming with a father's blood, Montasser was triumphantly led; but in
a reign of six months, he found only the pangs of a guilty conscience.
If he wept at the sight of an old tapestry which represented the crime
and punishment of the son of Chosroes, if his days were abridged by
grief and remorse, we may allow some pity to a parricide, who exclaimed,
in the bitterness of death, that he had lost both this world and the
world to come. After this act of treason, the ensigns of royalty, the
garment and walking-staff of Mahomet, were given and torn away by the
foreign mercenaries, who in four years created, deposed, and murdered,
three commanders of the faithful. As often as the Turks were inflamed
by fear, or rage, or avarice, these caliphs were dragged by the
feet, exposed naked to the scorching sun, beaten with iron clubs, and
compelled to purchase, by the abdication of their dignity, a short
reprieve of inevitable fate. [99] At length, however, the fury of the
tempest was spent or diverted: the Abbassides returned to the less
turbulent residence of Bagdad; the insolence of the Turks was curbed
with a firmer and more skilful hand, and their numbers were divided
and destroyed in foreign warfare. But the nations of the East had been
taught to trample on the successors of the prophet; and the blessings
of domestic peace were obtained by the relaxation of strength and
discipline. So uniform are the mischiefs of military despotism, that I
seem to repeat the story of the praetorians of Rome. [100]

[Footnote 97: M. de Guignes, who sometimes leaps, and sometimes
stumbles, in the gulf between Chinese and Mahometan story, thinks he
can see, that these Turks are the Hoei-ke, alias the Kao-tche, or
high-wagons; that they were divided into fifteen hordes, from China and
Siberia to the dominions of the caliphs and Samanides, &c., (Hist. des
Huns, tom. iii. p. 1-33, 124-131.)]

[Footnote 98: He changed the old name of Sumera, or Samara, into the
fanciful title of Sermen-rai, that which gives pleasure at first sight,
(D'Herbelot, Bibliotheque Orientale, p. 808. D'Anville, l'Euphrate et le
Tigre p. 97, 98.)]

[Footnote 99: Take a specimen, the death of the caliph Motaz: Correptum
pedibus pertrahunt, et sudibus probe permulcant, et spoliatum laceris
vestibus in sole collocant, prae cujus acerrimo aestu pedes alternos
attollebat et demittebat. Adstantium aliquis misero colaphos continuo
ingerebat, quos ille objectis manibus avertere studebat..... Quo facto
traditus tortori fuit, totoque triduo cibo potuque prohibitus.....
Suffocatus, &c. (Abulfeda, p. 206.) Of the caliph Mohtadi, he says,
services ipsi perpetuis ictibus contundebant, testiculosque pedibus
conculcabant, (p. 208.)]

[Footnote 100: See under the reigns of Motassem, Motawakkel, Montasser,
Mostain, Motaz, Mohtadi, and Motamed, in the Bibliotheque of D'Herbelot,
and the now familiar Annals of Elmacin, Abulpharagius, and Abulfeda.]

While the flame of enthusiasm was damped by the business, the pleasure,
and the knowledge, of the age, it burnt with concentrated heat in the
breasts of the chosen few, the congenial spirits, who were ambitious of
reigning either in this world or in the next. How carefully soever the
book of prophecy had been sealed by the apostle of Mecca, the wishes,
and (if we may profane the word) even the reason, of fanaticism might
believe that, after the successive missions of Adam, Noah, Abraham,
Moses, Jesus, and Mahomet, the same God, in the fulness of time, would
reveal a still more perfect and permanent law. In the two hundred and
seventy-seventh year of the Hegira, and in the neighborhood of Cufa,
an Arabian preacher, of the name of Carmath, assumed the lofty and
incomprehensible style of the Guide, the Director, the Demonstration,
the Word, the Holy Ghost, the Camel, the Herald of the Messiah, who had
conversed with him in a human shape, and the representative of Mohammed
the son of Ali, of St. John the Baptist, and of the angel Gabriel. In
his mystic volume, the precepts of the Koran were refined to a more
spiritual sense: he relaxed the duties of ablution, fasting, and
pilgrimage; allowed the indiscriminate use of wine and forbidden food;
and nourished the fervor of his disciples by the daily repetition of
fifty prayers. The idleness and ferment of the rustic crowd awakened the
attention of the magistrates of Cufa; a timid persecution assisted
the progress of the new sect; and the name of the prophet became more
revered after his person had been withdrawn from the world. His twelve
apostles dispersed themselves among the Bedoweens, "a race of men," says
Abulfeda, "equally devoid of reason and of religion;" and the success
of their preaching seemed to threaten Arabia with a new revolution. The
Carmathians were ripe for rebellion, since they disclaimed the title
of the house of Abbas, and abhorred the worldly pomp of the caliphs of
Bagdad. They were susceptible of discipline, since they vowed a blind
and absolute submission to their Imam, who was called to the prophetic
office by the voice of God and the people. Instead of the legal tithes,
he claimed the fifth of their substance and spoil; the most flagitious
sins were no more than the type of disobedience; and the brethren were
united and concealed by an oath of secrecy. After a bloody conflict,
they prevailed in the province of Bahrein, along the Persian Gulf:
far and wide, the tribes of the desert were subject to the sceptre,
or rather to the sword of Abu Said and his son Abu Taher; and these
rebellious imams could muster in the field a hundred and seven thousand
fanatics. The mercenaries of the caliph were dismayed at the approach
of an enemy who neither asked nor accepted quarter; and the difference
between, them in fortitude and patience, is expressive of the change
which three centuries of prosperity had effected in the character of the
Arabians. Such troops were discomfited in every action; the cities of
Racca and Baalbec, of Cufa and Bassora, were taken and pillaged; Bagdad
was filled with consternation; and the caliph trembled behind the veils
of his palace. In a daring inroad beyond the Tigris, Abu Taher advanced
to the gates of the capital with no more than five hundred horse. By
the special order of Moctader, the bridges had been broken down, and the
person or head of the rebel was expected every hour by the commander of
the faithful. His lieutenant, from a motive of fear or pity, apprised
Abu Taher of his danger, and recommended a speedy escape. "Your master,"
said the intrepid Carmathian to the messenger, "is at the head of thirty
thousand soldiers: three such men as these are wanting in his host:" at
the same instant, turning to three of his companions, he commanded the
first to plunge a dagger into his breast, the second to leap into the
Tigris, and the third to cast himself headlong down a precipice. They
obeyed without a murmur.

"Relate," continued the imam, "what you have seen: before the evening
your general shall be chained among my dogs." Before the evening, the
camp was surprised, and the menace was executed. The rapine of the
Carmathians was sanctified by their aversion to the worship of Mecca:
they robbed a caravan of pilgrims, and twenty thousand devout Moslems
were abandoned on the burning sands to a death of hunger and thirst.
Another year they suffered the pilgrims to proceed without interruption;
but, in the festival of devotion, Abu Taher stormed the holy city, and
trampled on the most venerable relics of the Mahometan faith. Thirty
thousand citizens and strangers were put to the sword; the sacred
precincts were polluted by the burial of three thousand dead bodies; the
well of Zemzem overflowed with blood; the golden spout was forced
from its place; the veil of the Caaba was divided among these impious
sectaries; and the black stone, the first monument of the nation, was
borne away in triumph to their capital. After this deed of sacrilege
and cruelty, they continued to infest the confines of Irak, Syria, and
Egypt: but the vital principle of enthusiasm had withered at the root.
Their scruples, or their avarice, again opened the pilgrimage of Mecca,
and restored the black stone of the Caaba; and it is needless to inquire
into what factions they were broken, or by whose swords they were
finally extirpated. The sect of the Carmathians may be considered as
the second visible cause of the decline and fall of the empire of the
caliphs. [101]

some inconsistencies of theology and chronology, which it would not be
easy nor of much importance to reconcile. * Note: Compare Von Hammer,
