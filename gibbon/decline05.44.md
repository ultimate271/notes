About twenty years after the conquest of Jerusalem by the Turks, the
holy sepulchre was visited by a hermit of the name of Peter, a native
of Amiens, in the province of Picardy [1] in France. His resentment
and sympathy were excited by his own injuries and the oppression of the
Christian name; he mingled his tears with those of the patriarch, and
earnestly inquired, if no hopes of relief could be entertained from the
Greek emperors of the East. The patriarch exposed the vices and weakness
of the successors of Constantine. "I will rouse," exclaimed the hermit,
"the martial nations of Europe in your cause;" and Europe was obedient
to the call of the hermit. The astonished patriarch dismissed him with
epistles of credit and complaint; and no sooner did he land at Bari,
than Peter hastened to kiss the feet of the Roman pontiff. His stature
was small, his appearance contemptible; but his eye was keen and lively;
and he possessed that vehemence of speech, which seldom fails to impart
the persuasion of the soul. [2] He was born of a gentleman's family,
(for we must now adopt a modern idiom,) and his military service was
under the neighboring counts of Boulogne, the heroes of the first
crusade. But he soon relinquished the sword and the world; and if it
be true, that his wife, however noble, was aged and ugly, he might
withdraw, with the less reluctance, from her bed to a convent, and at
length to a hermitage. [211] In this austere solitude, his body was
emaciated, his fancy was inflamed; whatever he wished, he believed;
whatever he believed, he saw in dreams and revelations. From Jerusalem
the pilgrim returned an accomplished fanatic; but as he excelled in the
popular madness of the times, Pope Urban the Second received him as
a prophet, applauded his glorious design, promised to support it in a
general council, and encouraged him to proclaim the deliverance of the
Holy Land. Invigorated by the approbation of the pontiff, his zealous
missionary traversed. with speed and success, the provinces of Italy and
France. His diet was abstemious, his prayers long and fervent, and the
alms which he received with one hand, he distributed with the other: his
head was bare, his feet naked, his meagre body was wrapped in a coarse
garment; he bore and displayed a weighty crucifix; and the ass on which
he rode was sanctified, in the public eye, by the service of the man of
God. He preached to innumerable crowds in the churches, the streets, and
the highways: the hermit entered with equal confidence the palace and
the cottage; and the people (for all was people) was impetuously moved
by his call to repentance and arms. When he painted the sufferings
of the natives and pilgrims of Palestine, every heart was melted to
compassion; every breast glowed with indignation, when he challenged the
warriors of the age to defend their brethren, and rescue their Savior:
his ignorance of art and language was compensated by sighs, and tears,
and ejaculations; and Peter supplied the deficiency of reason by loud
and frequent appeals to Christ and his mother, to the saints and angels
of paradise, with whom he had personally conversed. [212] The most
perfect orator of Athens might have envied the success of his eloquence;
the rustic enthusiast inspired the passions which he felt, and
Christendom expected with impatience the counsels and decrees of the
supreme pontiff.

[Footnote 1: Whimsical enough is the origin of the name of Picards, and
from thence of Picardie, which does not date later than A.D. 1200. It
was an academical joke, an epithet first applied to the quarrelsome
humor of those students, in the University of Paris, who came from the
frontier of France and Flanders, (Valesii Notitia Galliarum, p. 447,
Longuerue. Description de la France, p. 54.)]

[Footnote 2: William of Tyre (l. i. c. 11, p. 637, 638) thus describes
the hermit: Pusillus, persona contemptibilis, vivacis ingenii, et oculum
habeas perspicacem gratumque, et sponte fluens ei non deerat eloquium.

The magnanimous spirit of Gregory the Seventh had already embraced the
design of arming Europe against Asia; the ardor of his zeal and ambition
still breathes in his epistles: from either side of the Alps, fifty
thousand Catholics had enlisted under the banner of St. Peter; [3] and
his successor reveals his intention of marching at their head against
the impious sectaries of Mahomet. But the glory or reproach of
executing, though not in person, this holy enterprise, was reserved for
Urban the Second, [4] the most faithful of his disciples. He undertook
the conquest of the East, whilst the larger portion of Rome was
possessed and fortified by his rival Guibert of Ravenna, who contended
with Urban for the name and honors of the pontificate. He attempted to
unite the powers of the West, at a time when the princes were
separated from the church, and the people from their princes, by the
excommunication which himself and his predecessors had thundered
against the emperor and the king of France. Philip the First, of France,
supported with patience the censures which he had provoked by his
scandalous life and adulterous marriage. Henry the Fourth, of Germany,
asserted the right of investitures, the prerogative of confirming his
bishops by the delivery of the ring and crosier. But the emperor's
party was crushed in Italy by the arms of the Normans and the Countess
Mathilda; and the long quarrel had been recently envenomed by the revolt
of his son Conrad and the shame of his wife, [5] who, in the synods of
Constance and Placentia, confessed the manifold prostitutions to which
she had been exposed by a husband regardless of her honor and his own.
[6] So popular was the cause of Urban, so weighty was his influence,
that the council which he summoned at Placentia [7] was composed of two
hundred bishops of Italy, France, Burgandy, Swabia, and Bavaria. Four
thousand of the clergy, and thirty thousand of the laity, attended this
important meeting; and, as the most spacious cathedral would have been
inadequate to the multitude, the session of seven days was held in
a plain adjacent to the city. The ambassadors of the Greek emperor,
Alexius Comnenus, were introduced to plead the distress of their
sovereign, and the danger of Constantinople, which was divided only by
a narrow sea from the victorious Turks, the common enemies of the
Christian name. In their suppliant address they flattered the pride of
the Latin princes; and, appealing at once to their policy and religion,
exhorted them to repel the Barbarians on the confines of Asia, rather
than to expect them in the heart of Europe. At the sad tale of the
misery and perils of their Eastern brethren, the assembly burst into
tears; the most eager champions declared their readiness to march; and
the Greek ambassadors were dismissed with the assurance of a speedy and
powerful succor. The relief of Constantinople was included in the
larger and most distant project of the deliverance of Jerusalem; but the
prudent Urban adjourned the final decision to a second synod, which he
proposed to celebrate in some city of France in the autumn of the same
year. The short delay would propagate the flame of enthusiasm; and
his firmest hope was in a nation of soldiers [8] still proud of
the preeminence of their name, and ambitious to emulate their hero
Charlemagne, [9] who, in the popular romance of Turpin, [10] had
achieved the conquest of the Holy Land. A latent motive of affection or
vanity might influence the choice of Urban: he was himself a native of
France, a monk of Clugny, and the first of his countrymen who ascended
the throne of St. Peter. The pope had illustrated his family and
province; nor is there perhaps a more exquisite gratification than to
revisit, in a conspicuous dignity, the humble and laborious scenes of
our youth.

No. 4.) In the synod of Constance, she is described by Bertholdus, rerum
inspector: quae se tantas et tam inauditas fornicationum spur citias, et
a tantis passam fuisse conquesta est, &c.; and again at Placentia: satis
misericorditer suscepit, eo quod ipsam tantas spurcitias pertulisse pro
certo cognoverit papa cum sancta synodo. Apud Baron. A.D. 1093, No. 4,
1094, No. 3. A rare subject for the infallible decision of a pope and
council. These abominations are repugnant to every principle of human
nature, which is not altered by a dispute about rings and crosiers. Yet
it should seem, that the wretched woman was tempted by the priests to
relate or subscribe some infamous stories of herself and her husband.]

[Footnote 8: Guibert, himself a Frenchman, praises the piety and valor
of the French nation, the author and example of the crusades: Gens

Anglos, Ligures, si bonis eos moribus videamus, non illico Francos
homines appellemus? (p. 478.) He owns, however, that the vivacity of the
French degenerates into petulance among foreigners, (p. 488.) and vain
loquaciousness, (p. 502.)]

[Footnote 10: John Tilpinus, or Turpinus, was archbishop of Rheims, A.D.
773. After the year 1000, this romance was composed in his name, by
a monk of the borders of France and Spain; and such was the idea of
ecclesiastical merit, that he describes himself as a fighting and
drinking priest! Yet the book of lies was pronounced authentic by Pope
Calixtus II., (A.D. 1122,) and is respectfully quoted by the abbot
Suger, in the great Chronicles of St. Denys, (Fabric Bibliot. Latin
Medii Aevi, edit. Mansi, tom. iv. p. 161.)]

It may occasion some surprise that the Roman pontiff should erect, in
the heart of France, the tribunal from whence he hurled his anathemas
against the king; but our surprise will vanish so soon as we form a just
estimate of a king of France of the eleventh century. [11] Philip the
First was the great-grandson of Hugh Capet, the founder of the present
race, who, in the decline of Charlemagne's posterity, added the regal
title to his patrimonial estates of Paris and Orleans. In this narrow
compass, he was possessed of wealth and jurisdiction; but in the rest
of France, Hugh and his first descendants were no more than the feudal
lords of about sixty dukes and counts, of independent and hereditary
power, [12] who disdained the control of laws and legal assemblies, and
whose disregard of their sovereign was revenged by the disobedience of
their inferior vassals. At Clermont, in the territories of the count
of Auvergne, [13] the pope might brave with impunity the resentment
of Philip; and the council which he convened in that city was not less
numerous or respectable than the synod of Placentia. [14] Besides his
court and council of Roman cardinals, he was supported by thirteen
archbishops and two hundred and twenty-five bishops: the number of
mitred prelates was computed at four hundred; and the fathers of the
church were blessed by the saints and enlightened by the doctors of the
age. From the adjacent kingdoms, a martial train of lords and knights of
power and renown attended the council, [15] in high expectation of its
resolves; and such was the ardor of zeal and curiosity, that the city
was filled, and many thousands, in the month of November, erected their
tents or huts in the open field. A session of eight days produced some
useful or edifying canons for the reformation of manners; a severe
censure was pronounced against the license of private war; the Truce of
God [16] was confirmed, a suspension of hostilities during four days
of the week; women and priests were placed under the safeguard of the
church; and a protection of three years was extended to husbandmen
and merchants, the defenceless victims of military rapine. But a law,
however venerable be the sanction, cannot suddenly transform the temper
of the times; and the benevolent efforts of Urban deserve the less
praise, since he labored to appease some domestic quarrels that he might
spread the flames of war from the Atlantic to the Euphrates. From the
synod of Placentia, the rumor of his great design had gone forth among
the nations: the clergy on their return had preached in every diocese
the merit and glory of the deliverance of the Holy Land; and when the
pope ascended a lofty scaffold in the market-place of Clermont, his
eloquence was addressed to a well-prepared and impatient audience.
His topics were obvious, his exhortation was vehement, his success
inevitable. The orator was interrupted by the shout of thousands, who
with one voice, and in their rustic idiom, exclaimed aloud, "God wills
it, God wills it." [17] "It is indeed the will of God," replied the
pope; "and let this memorable word, the inspiration surely of the
Holy Spirit, be forever adopted as your cry of battle, to animate the
devotion and courage of the champions of Christ. His cross is the symbol
of your salvation; wear it, a red, a bloody cross, as an external mark,
on your breasts or shoulders, as a pledge of your sacred and irrevocable
engagement." The proposal was joyfully accepted; great numbers, both of
the clergy and laity, impressed on their garments the sign of the cross,
[18] and solicited the pope to march at their head. This dangerous honor
was declined by the more prudent successor of Gregory, who alleged
the schism of the church, and the duties of his pastoral office,
recommending to the faithful, who were disqualified by sex or
profession, by age or infirmity, to aid, with their prayers and alms,
the personal service of their robust brethren. The name and powers
of his legate he devolved on Adhemar bishop of Puy, the first who had
received the cross at his hands. The foremost of the temporal chiefs was
Raymond count of Thoulouse, whose ambassadors in the council excused the
absence, and pledged the honor, of their master. After the confession
and absolution of their sins, the champions of the cross were dismissed
with a superfluous admonition to invite their countrymen and friends;
and their departure for the Holy Land was fixed to the festival of the
Assumption, the fifteenth of August, of the ensuing year. [19]

ii. p. 651.) Yet in England, the red ever appears the favorite, and as
if were, the national, color of our military ensigns and uniforms.]

[Footnote 19: Bongarsius, who has published the original writers of the
crusades, adopts, with much complacency, the fanatic title of Guibertus,
Gesta Dei per Francos; though some critics propose to read Gesta Diaboli
per Francos, (Hanoviae, 1611, two vols. in folio.) I shall briefly
enumerate, as they stand in this collection, the authors whom I have
used for the first crusade.

     I.    Gesta Francorum.

     II.   Robertus Monachus.

     III.  Baldricus.

     IV.   Raimundus de Agiles.

     V.    Albertus Aquensis VI. Fulcherius Carnotensis.

     VII.  Guibertus.

     VIII. Willielmus Tyriensis. Muratori has given us,

     IX.   Radulphus Cadomensis de Gestis Tancredi,

     (Script. Rer. Ital. tom. v. p. 285-333,)

     X.    Bernardus Thesaurarius de Acquisitione Terrae Sanctae,

         (tom. vii. p. 664-848.)

The last of these was unknown to a late French historian, who has given
a large and critical list of the writers of the crusades, (Esprit des
Croisades, tom. i. p. 13-141,) and most of whose judgments my own
experience will allow me to ratify. It was late before I could obtain a
sight of the French historians collected by Duchesne. I. Petri Tudebodi
Sacerdotis Sivracensis Historia de Hierosolymitano Itinere, (tom. iv.
p. 773-815,) has been transfused into the first anonymous writer of
Bongarsius. II. The Metrical History of the first Crusade, in vii.
books, (p. 890-912,) is of small value or account. * Note: Several
new documents, particularly from the East, have been collected by
the industry of the modern historians of the crusades, M. Michaud and
Wilken.--M.]

So familiar, and as it were so natural to man, is the practice of
violence, that our indulgence allows the slightest provocation, the most
disputable right, as a sufficient ground of national hostility. But the
name and nature of a holy war demands a more rigorous scrutiny; nor
can we hastily believe, that the servants of the Prince of Peace would
unsheathe the sword of destruction, unless the motive were pure, the
quarrel legitimate, and the necessity inevitable. The policy of an
action may be determined from the tardy lessons of experience; but,
before we act, our conscience should be satisfied of the justice and
propriety of our enterprise. In the age of the crusades, the Christians,
both of the East and West, were persuaded of their lawfulness and merit;
their arguments are clouded by the perpetual abuse of Scripture and
rhetoric; but they seem to insist on the right of natural and religious
defence, their peculiar title to the Holy Land, and the impiety of their
Pagan and Mahometan foes. [20]

I. The right of a just defence may fairly include our civil and
spiritual allies: it depends on the existence of danger; and that danger
must be estimated by the twofold consideration of the malice, and
the power, of our enemies. A pernicious tenet has been imputed to the
Mahometans, the duty of extirpating all other religions by the sword.
This charge of ignorance and bigotry is refuted by the Koran, by the
history of the Mussulman conquerors, and by their public and legal
toleration of the Christian worship. But it cannot be denied, that the
Oriental churches are depressed under their iron yoke; that, in peace
and war, they assert a divine and indefeasible claim of universal
empire; and that, in their orthodox creed, the unbelieving nations are
continually threatened with the loss of religion or liberty. In the
eleventh century, the victorious arms of the Turks presented a real
and urgent apprehension of these losses. They had subdued, in less
than thirty years, the kingdoms of Asia, as far as Jerusalem and the
Hellespont; and the Greek empire tottered on the verge of destruction.
Besides an honest sympathy for their brethren, the Latins had a right
and interest in the support of Constantinople, the most important
barrier of the West; and the privilege of defence must reach to prevent,
as well as to repel, an impending assault. But this salutary purpose
might have been accomplished by a moderate succor; and our calmer
reason must disclaim the innumerable hosts, and remote operations, which
overwhelmed Asia and depopulated Europe. [2011]

[Footnote 20: If the reader will turn to the first scene of the First
Part of Henry the Fourth, he will see in the text of Shakespeare the
natural feelings of enthusiasm; and in the notes of Dr. Johnson the
workings of a bigoted, though vigorous mind, greedy of every pretence to
hate and persecute those who dissent from his creed.]

[Footnote 2011: The manner in which the war was conducted surely has
little relation to the abstract question of the justice or injustice of
the war. The most just and necessary war may be conducted with the
most prodigal waste of human life, and the wildest fanaticism; the
most unjust with the coolest moderation and consummate generalship. The
question is, whether the liberties and religion of Europe were in danger
from the aggressions of Mahometanism? If so, it is difficult to
limit the right, though it may be proper to question the wisdom, of
overwhelming the enemy with the armed population of a whole continent,
and repelling, if possible, the invading conqueror into his native
deserts. The crusades are monuments of human folly! but to which of
the more regular wars civilized. Europe, waged for personal ambition or
national jealousy, will our calmer reason appeal as monuments either of
human justice or human wisdom?--M.]

II. Palestine could add nothing to the strength or safety of the Latins;
and fanaticism alone could pretend to justify the conquest of that
distant and narrow province. The Christians affirmed that their
inalienable title to the promised land had been sealed by the blood
of their divine Savior; it was their right and duty to rescue their
inheritance from the unjust possessors, who profaned his sepulchre, and
oppressed the pilgrimage of his disciples. Vainly would it be alleged
that the preeminence of Jerusalem, and the sanctity of Palestine, have
been abolished with the Mosaic law; that the God of the Christians is
not a local deity, and that the recovery of Bethlem or Calvary, his
cradle or his tomb, will not atone for the violation of the moral
precepts of the gospel. Such arguments glance aside from the leaden
shield of superstition; and the religious mind will not easily
relinquish its hold on the sacred ground of mystery and miracle.

III. But the holy wars which have been waged in every climate of the
globe, from Egypt to Livonia, and from Peru to Hindostan, require the
support of some more general and flexible tenet. It has been often
supposed, and sometimes affirmed, that a difference of religion is a
worthy cause of hostility; that obstinate unbelievers may be slain
or subdued by the champions of the cross; and that grace is the sole
fountain of dominion as well as of mercy. [2012] Above four hundred
years before the first crusade, the eastern and western provinces of
the Roman empire had been acquired about the same time, and in the same
manner, by the Barbarians of Germany and Arabia. Time and treaties had
legitimated the conquest of the Christian Franks; but in the eyes of
their subjects and neighbors, the Mahometan princes were still tyrants
and usurpers, who, by the arms of war or rebellion, might be lawfully
driven from their unlawful possession. [21]

[Footnote 2012: "God," says the abbot Guibert, "invented the crusades as
a new way for the laity to atone for their sins and to merit salvation."
This extraordinary and characteristic passage must be given entire.
"Deus nostro tempore praelia sancta instituit, ut ordo equestris et
vulgus oberrans qui vetustae Paganitatis exemplo in mutuas versabatur
caedes, novum reperirent salutis promerendae genus, ut nec funditus
electa, ut fieri assolet, monastica conversatione, seu religiosa
qualibet professione saeculum relinquere congerentur; sed sub consueta
licentia et habitu ex suo ipsorum officio Dei aliquantenus gratiam
consequerentur." Guib. Abbas, p. 371. See Wilken, vol. i. p. 63.--M.]

[Footnote 21: The vith Discourse of Fleury on Ecclesiastical History
(p. 223-261) contains an accurate and rational view of the causes and
effects of the crusades.]

As the manners of the Christians were relaxed, their discipline of
penance [22] was enforced; and with the multiplication of sins, the
remedies were multiplied. In the primitive church, a voluntary and
open confession prepared the work of atonement. In the middle ages, the
bishops and priests interrogated the criminal; compelled him to account
for his thoughts, words, and actions; and prescribed the terms of
his reconciliation with God. But as this discretionary power might
alternately be abused by indulgence and tyranny, a rule of discipline
was framed, to inform and regulate the spiritual judges. This mode of
legislation was invented by the Greeks; their penitentials [23] were
translated, or imitated, in the Latin church; and, in the time of
Charlemagne, the clergy of every diocese were provided with a code,
which they prudently concealed from the knowledge of the vulgar. In this
dangerous estimate of crimes and punishments, each case was supposed,
each difference was remarked, by the experience or penetration of
the monks; some sins are enumerated which innocence could not have
suspected, and others which reason cannot believe; and the more ordinary
offences of fornication and adultery, of perjury and sacrilege, of
rapine and murder, were expiated by a penance, which, according to the
various circumstances, was prolonged from forty days to seven years.
During this term of mortification, the patient was healed, the criminal
was absolved, by a salutary regimen of fasts and prayers: the disorder
of his dress was expressive of grief and remorse; and he humbly
abstained from all the business and pleasure of social life. But the
rigid execution of these laws would have depopulated the palace, the
camp, and the city; the Barbarians of the West believed and trembled;
but nature often rebelled against principle; and the magistrate labored
without effect to enforce the jurisdiction of the priest. A literal
accomplishment of penance was indeed impracticable: the guilt of
adultery was multiplied by daily repetition; that of homicide might
involve the massacre of a whole people; each act was separately
numbered; and, in those times of anarchy and vice, a modest sinner might
easily incur a debt of three hundred years. His insolvency was relieved
by a commutation, or indulgence: a year of penance was appreciated at
twenty-six solidi [24] of silver, about four pounds sterling, for the
rich; at three solidi, or nine shillings, for the indigent: and these
alms were soon appropriated to the use of the church, which derived,
from the redemption of sins, an inexhaustible source of opulence and
dominion. A debt of three hundred years, or twelve hundred pounds,
was enough to impoverish a plentiful fortune; the scarcity of gold
and silver was supplied by the alienation of land; and the princely
donations of Pepin and Charlemagne are expressly given for the remedy
of their soul. It is a maxim of the civil law, that whosoever cannot pay
with his purse, must pay with his body; and the practice of flagellation
was adopted by the monks, a cheap, though painful equivalent. By a
fantastic arithmetic, a year of penance was taxed at three thousand
lashes; [25] and such was the skill and patience of a famous hermit, St.
Dominic of the iron Cuirass, [26] that in six days he could discharge
an entire century, by a whipping of three hundred thousand stripes.
His example was followed by many penitents of both sexes; and, as a
vicarious sacrifice was accepted, a sturdy disciplinarian might expiate
on his own back the sins of his benefactors. [27] These compensations
of the purse and the person introduced, in the eleventh century, a more
honorable mode of satisfaction. The merit of military service against
the Saracens of Africa and Spain had been allowed by the predecessors
of Urban the Second. In the council of Clermont, that pope proclaimed
a plenary indulgence to those who should enlist under the banner of the
cross; the absolution of all their sins, and a full receipt for all that
might be due of canonical penance. [28] The cold philosophy of modern
times is incapable of feeling the impression that was made on a sinful
and fanatic world. At the voice of their pastor, the robber, the
incendiary, the homicide, arose by thousands to redeem their souls,
by repeating on the infidels the same deeds which they had exercised
against their Christian brethren; and the terms of atonement were
eagerly embraced by offenders of every rank and denomination. None were
pure; none were exempt from the guilt and penalty of sin; and those who
were the least amenable to the justice of God and the church were the
best entitled to the temporal and eternal recompense of their pious
courage. If they fell, the spirit of the Latin clergy did not hesitate
to adorn their tomb with the crown of martyrdom; [29] and should they
survive, they could expect without impatience the delay and increase of
their heavenly reward. They offered their blood to the Son of God, who
had laid down his life for their salvation: they took up the cross, and
entered with confidence into the way of the Lord. His providence would
watch over their safety; perhaps his visible and miraculous power would
smooth the difficulties of their holy enterprise. The cloud and pillar
of Jehovah had marched before the Israelites into the promised land.
Might not the Christians more reasonably hope that the rivers would open
for their passage; that the walls of their strongest cities would fall
at the sound of their trumpets; and that the sun would be arrested in
his mid career, to allow them time for the destruction of the infidels?

[Footnote 22: The penance, indulgences, &c., of the middle ages are
amply discussed by Muratori, (Antiquitat. Italiae Medii Aevi, tom. v.
dissert. lxviii. p. 709-768,) and by M. Chais, (Lettres sur les Jubiles
et les Indulgences, tom. ii. lettres 21 & 22, p. 478-556,) with this
difference, that the abuses of superstition are mildly, perhaps faintly,
exposed by the learned Italian, and peevishly magnified by the Dutch
minister.]

[Footnote 23: Schmidt (Histoire des Allemands, tom. ii. p. 211-220,
452-462) gives an abstract of the Penitential of Rhegino in the ninth,
and of Burchard in the tenth, century. In one year, five-and-thirty
murders were perpetrated at Worms.]

[Footnote 24: Till the xiith century, we may support the clear account
of xii. denarii, or pence, to the solidus, or shilling; and xx. solidi
to the pound weight of silver, about the pound sterling. Our money is
diminished to a third, and the French to a fiftieth, of this primitive
standard.]

[Footnote 25: Each century of lashes was sanctified with a recital of a
psalm, and the whole Psalter, with the accompaniment of 15,000 stripes,
was equivalent to five years.]

[Footnote 26: The Life and Achievements of St. Dominic Loricatus was
composed by his friend and admirer, Peter Damianus. See Fleury, Hist.
Eccles. tom. xiii. p. 96-104. Baronius, A.D. 1056, No. 7, who observes,
from Damianus, how fashionable, even among ladies of quality, (sublimis
generis,) this expiation (purgatorii genus) was grown.]

[Footnote 27: At a quarter, or even half a rial a lash, Sancho Panza
was a cheaper, and possibly not a more dishonest, workman. I remember in
Pere Labat (Voyages en Italie, tom. vii. p. 16-29) a very lively picture
of the dexterity of one of these artists.]

[Footnote 28: Quicunque pro sola devotione, non pro honoris vel pecuniae
adoptione, ad liberandam ecclesiam Dei Jerusalem profectus fuerit, iter
illud pro omni poenitentia reputetur. Canon. Concil. Claromont. ii.
p. 829. Guibert styles it novum salutis genus, (p. 471,) and is almost
philosophical on the subject. * Note: See note, page 546.--M.]

[Footnote 29: Such at least was the belief of the crusaders, and such is
the uniform style of the historians, (Esprit des Croisades, tom. iii.
p. 477;) but the prayer for the repose of their souls is inconsistent in
orthodox theology with the merits of martyrdom.]
