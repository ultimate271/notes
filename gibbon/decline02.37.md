## Chapter XXII: Julian Declared Emperor.--Part IV.

The numerous army of spies, of agents, and informers enlisted by
Constantius to secure the repose of one man, and to interrupt that of
millions, was immediately disbanded by his generous successor. Julian
was slow in his suspicions, and gentle in his punishments; and his
contempt of treason was the result of judgment, of vanity, and of
courage. Conscious of superior merit, he was persuaded that few among
his subjects would dare to meet him in the field, to attempt his life,
or even to seat themselves on his vacant throne. The philosopher could
excuse the hasty sallies of discontent; and the hero could despise the
ambitious projects which surpassed the fortune or the abilities of the
rash conspirators. A citizen of Ancyra had prepared for his own use a
purple garment; and this indiscreet action, which, under the reign of
Constantius, would have been considered as a capital offence, [68] was
reported to Julian by the officious importunity of a private enemy. The
monarch, after making some inquiry into the rank and character of
his rival, despatched the informer with a present of a pair of purple
slippers, to complete the magnificence of his Imperial habit. A more
dangerous conspiracy was formed by ten of the domestic guards, who had
resolved to assassinate Julian in the field of exercise near Antioch.
Their intemperance revealed their guilt; and they were conducted in
chains to the presence of their injured sovereign, who, after a lively
representation of the wickedness and folly of their enterprise, instead
of a death of torture, which they deserved and expected, pronounced a
sentence of exile against the two principal offenders. The only instance
in which Julian seemed to depart from his accustomed clemency, was the
execution of a rash youth, who, with a feeble hand, had aspired to
seize the reins of empire. But that youth was the son of Marcellus, the
general of cavalry, who, in the first campaign of the Gallic war, had
deserted the standard of the Caesar and the republic. Without appearing
to indulge his personal resentment, Julian might easily confound
the crime of the son and of the father; but he was reconciled by the
distress of Marcellus, and the liberality of the emperor endeavored to
heal the wound which had been inflicted by the hand of justice. [69]

[Footnote 68: The president Montesquieu (Considerations sur la Grandeur,
&c., des Romains, c. xiv. in his works, tom. iii. p. 448, 449,) excuses
this minute and absurd tyranny, by supposing that actions the most
indifferent in our eyes might excite, in a Roman mind, the idea of
guilt and danger. This strange apology is supported by a strange
misapprehension of the English laws, "chez une nation.... ou il est
defendu da boire a la sante d'une certaine personne."]

[Footnote 69: The clemency of Julian, and the conspiracy which was
formed against his life at Antioch, are described by Ammianus (xxii. 9,
10, and Vales, ad loc.) and Libanius, (Orat. Parent. c. 99, p. 323.)]

Julian was not insensible of the advantages of freedom. [70] From his
studies he had imbibed the spirit of ancient sages and heroes; his
life and fortunes had depended on the caprice of a tyrant; and when
he ascended the throne, his pride was sometimes mortified by the
reflection, that the slaves who would not dare to censure his defects
were not worthy to applaud his virtues. [71] He sincerely abhorred the
system of Oriental despotism, which Diocletian, Constantine, and the
patient habits of fourscore years, had established in the empire. A
motive of superstition prevented the execution of the design, which
Julian had frequently meditated, of relieving his head from the weight
of a costly diadem; [72] but he absolutely refused the title of Dominus,
or Lord, [73] a word which was grown so familiar to the ears of the
Romans, that they no longer remembered its servile and humiliating
origin. The office, or rather the name, of consul, was cherished by a
prince who contemplated with reverence the ruins of the republic; and
the same behavior which had been assumed by the prudence of Augustus
was adopted by Julian from choice and inclination. On the calends of
January, at break of day, the new consuls, Mamertinus and Nevitta,
hastened to the palace to salute the emperor. As soon as he was informed
of their approach, he leaped from his throne, eagerly advanced to
meet them, and compelled the blushing magistrates to receive the
demonstrations of his affected humility. From the palace they proceeded
to the senate. The emperor, on foot, marched before their litters; and
the gazing multitude admired the image of ancient times, or secretly
blamed a conduct, which, in their eyes, degraded the majesty of the
purple. [74] But the behavior of Julian was uniformly supported. During
the games of the Circus, he had, imprudently or designedly, performed
the manumission of a slave in the presence of the consul. The moment
he was reminded that he had trespassed on the jurisdiction of another
magistrate, he condemned himself to pay a fine of ten pounds of gold;
and embraced this public occasion of declaring to the world, that he
was subject, like the rest of his fellow-citizens, to the laws, [75] and
even to the forms, of the republic. The spirit of his administration,
and his regard for the place of his nativity, induced Julian to confer
on the senate of Constantinople the same honors, privileges, and
authority, which were still enjoyed by the senate of ancient Rome. [76]
A legal fiction was introduced, and gradually established, that one half
of the national council had migrated into the East; and the despotic
successors of Julian, accepting the title of Senators, acknowledged
themselves the members of a respectable body, which was permitted
to represent the majesty of the Roman name. From Constantinople, the
attention of the monarch was extended to the municipal senates of the
provinces. He abolished, by repeated edicts, the unjust and pernicious
exemptions which had withdrawn so many idle citizens from the services
of their country; and by imposing an equal distribution of public
duties, he restored the strength, the splendor, or, according to the
glowing expression of Libanius, [77] the soul of the expiring cities
of his empire. The venerable age of Greece excited the most tender
compassion in the mind of Julian, which kindled into rapture when he
recollected the gods, the heroes, and the men superior to heroes and to
gods, who have bequeathed to the latest posterity the monuments of their
genius, or the example of their virtues. He relieved the distress, and
restored the beauty, of the cities of Epirus and Peloponnesus. [78]
Athens acknowledged him for her benefactor; Argos, for her deliverer.
The pride of Corinth, again rising from her ruins with the honors of
a Roman colony, exacted a tribute from the adjacent republics, for the
purpose of defraying the games of the Isthmus, which were celebrated
in the amphitheatre with the hunting of bears and panthers. From this
tribute the cities of Elis, of Delphi, and of Argos, which had inherited
from their remote ancestors the sacred office of perpetuating the
Olympic, the Pythian, and the Nemean games, claimed a just exemption.
The immunity of Elis and Delphi was respected by the Corinthians; but
the poverty of Argos tempted the insolence of oppression; and the feeble
complaints of its deputies were silenced by the decree of a provincial
magistrate, who seems to have consulted only the interest of the capital
in which he resided. Seven years after this sentence, Julian [79]
allowed the cause to be referred to a superior tribunal; and his
eloquence was interposed, most probably with success, in the defence of
a city, which had been the royal seat of Agamemnon, [80] and had given
to Macedonia a race of kings and conquerors. [81]

[Footnote 70: According to some, says Aristotle, (as he is quoted by
Julian ad Themist. p. 261,) the form of absolute government is contrary
to nature. Both the prince and the philosopher choose, how ever to
involve this eternal truth in artful and labored obscurity.]

[Footnote 71: That sentiment is expressed almost in the words of Julian
himself. Ammian. xxii. 10.]

[Footnote 72: Libanius, (Orat. Parent. c. 95, p. 320,) who mentions the
wish and design of Julian, insinuates, in mysterious language that the
emperor was restrained by some particular revelation.]

[Footnote 73: Julian in Misopogon, p. 343. As he never abolished, by any
public law, the proud appellations of Despot, or Dominus, they are
still extant on his medals, (Ducange, Fam. Byzantin. p. 38, 39;) and the
private displeasure which he affected to express, only gave a different
tone to the servility of the court. The Abbe de la Bleterie (Hist. de
Jovien, tom. ii. p. 99-102) has curiously traced the origin and progress
of the word Dominus under the Imperial government.]

[Footnote 74: Ammian. xxii. 7. The consul Mamertinus (in Panegyr. Vet.
xi. 28, 29, 30) celebrates the auspicious day, like an elegant slave,
astonished and intoxicated by the condescension of his master.]

[Footnote 75: Personal satire was condemned by the laws of the
twelve tables: Si male condiderit in quem quis carmina, jus est
Judiciumque--Horat. Sat. ii. 1. 82. -----Julian (in Misopogon, p. 337)
owns himself subject to the law; and the Abbe de la Bleterie (Hist. de
Jovien, tom. ii. p. 92) has eagerly embraced a declaration so agreeable
to his own system, and, indeed, to the true spirit of the Imperial
constitution.]

[Footnote 76: Zosimus, l. iii. p. 158.]

[Footnote 77: See Libanius, (Orat. Parent. c. 71, p. 296,) Ammianus,
(xxii. 9,) and the Theodosian Code (l. xii. tit. i. leg. 50-55.) with
Godefroy's Commentary, (tom. iv. p. 390-402.) Yet the whole subject of
the Curia, notwithstanding very ample materials, still remains the most
obscure in the legal history of the empire.]

[Footnote 78: Quae paulo ante arida et siti anhelantia visebantur, ea
nunc perlui, mundari, madere; Fora, Deambulacra, Gymnasia, laetis et
gaudentibus populis frequentari; dies festos, et celebrari veteres,
et novos in honorem principis consecrari, (Mamertin. xi. 9.) He
particularly restored the city of Nicopolis and the Actiac games, which
had been instituted by Augustus.]

[Footnote 79: Julian. Epist. xxxv. p. 407-411. This epistle, which
illustrates the declining age of Greece, is omitted by the Abbe de la
Bleterie, and strangely disfigured by the Latin translator, who, by
rendering tributum, and populus, directly contradicts the sense of the
original.]

[Footnote 80: He reigned in Mycenae at the distance of fifty stadia, or
six miles from Argos: but these cities, which alternately flourished,
are confounded by the Greek poets. Strabo, l. viii. p. 579, edit.
Amstel. 1707.]

[Footnote 81: Marsham, Canon. Chron. p. 421. This pedigree from Temenus
and Hercules may be suspicious; yet it was allowed, after a strict
inquiry, by the judges of the Olympic games, (Herodot. l. v. c. 22,) at
a time when the Macedonian kings were obscure and unpopular in Greece.
When the Achaean league declared against Philip, it was thought decent
that the deputies of Argos should retire, (T. Liv. xxxii. 22.)]

The laborious administration of military and civil affairs, which were
multiplied in proportion to the extent of the empire, exercised the
abilities of Julian; but he frequently assumed the two characters of
Orator [82] and of Judge, [83] which are almost unknown to the modern
sovereigns of Europe. The arts of persuasion, so diligently cultivated
by the first Caesars, were neglected by the military ignorance and
Asiatic pride of their successors; and if they condescended to harangue
the soldiers, whom they feared, they treated with silent disdain the
senators, whom they despised. The assemblies of the senate, which
Constantius had avoided, were considered by Julian as the place where he
could exhibit, with the most propriety, the maxims of a republican, and
the talents of a rhetorician. He alternately practised, as in a school
of declamation, the several modes of praise, of censure, of exhortation;
and his friend Libanius has remarked, that the study of Homer taught
him to imitate the simple, concise style of Menelaus, the copiousness of
Nestor, whose words descended like the flakes of a winter's snow, or the
pathetic and forcible eloquence of Ulysses. The functions of a judge,
which are sometimes incompatible with those of a prince, were exercised
by Julian, not only as a duty, but as an amusement; and although he
might have trusted the integrity and discernment of his Praetorian
praefects, he often placed himself by their side on the seat of
judgment. The acute penetration of his mind was agreeably occupied in
detecting and defeating the chicanery of the advocates, who labored to
disguise the truths of facts, and to pervert the sense of the laws.
He sometimes forgot the gravity of his station, asked indiscreet or
unseasonable questions, and betrayed, by the loudness of his voice,
and the agitation of his body, the earnest vehemence with which he
maintained his opinion against the judges, the advocates, and their
clients. But his knowledge of his own temper prompted him to encourage,
and even to solicit, the reproof of his friends and ministers; and
whenever they ventured to oppose the irregular sallies of his passions,
the spectators could observe the shame, as well as the gratitude, of
their monarch. The decrees of Julian were almost always founded on the
principles of justice; and he had the firmness to resist the two most
dangerous temptations, which assault the tribunal of a sovereign, under
the specious forms of compassion and equity. He decided the merits of
the cause without weighing the circumstances of the parties; and the
poor, whom he wished to relieve, were condemned to satisfy the just
demands of a wealthy and noble adversary. He carefully distinguished
the judge from the legislator; [84] and though he meditated a necessary
reformation of the Roman jurisprudence, he pronounced sentence according
to the strict and literal interpretation of those laws, which the
magistrates were bound to execute, and the subjects to obey.

[Footnote 82: His eloquence is celebrated by Libanius, (Orat. Parent.
c. 75, 76, p. 300, 301,) who distinctly mentions the orators of Homer.
Socrates (l. iii. c. 1) has rashly asserted that Julian was the
only prince, since Julius Caesar, who harangued the senate. All
the predecessors of Nero, (Tacit. Annal. xiii. 3,) and many of his
successors, possessed the faculty of speaking in public; and it might
be proved by various examples, that they frequently exercised it in the
senate.]

[Footnote 83: Ammianus (xxi. 10) has impartially stated the merits and
defects of his judicial proceedings. Libanius (Orat. Parent. c. 90,
91, p. 315, &c.) has seen only the fair side, and his picture, if
it flatters the person, expresses at least the duties, of the judge.
Gregory Nazianzen, (Orat. iv. p. 120,) who suppresses the virtues, and
exaggerates even the venial faults of the Apostate, triumphantly
asks, whether such a judge was fit to be seated between Minos and
Rhadamanthus, in the Elysian Fields.]

[Footnote 84: Of the laws which Julian enacted in a reign of sixteen
months, fifty-four have been admitted into the codes of Theodosius and
Justinian. (Gothofred. Chron. Legum, p. 64-67.) The Abbe de la Bleterie
(tom. ii. p. 329-336) has chosen one of these laws to give an idea of
Julian's Latin style, which is forcible and elaborate, but less pure
than his Greek.]

The generality of princes, if they were stripped of their purple, and
cast naked into the world, would immediately sink to the lowest rank
of society, without a hope of emerging from their obscurity. But the
personal merit of Julian was, in some measure, independent of his
fortune. Whatever had been his choice of life, by the force of intrepid
courage, lively wit, and intense application, he would have obtained, or
at least he would have deserved, the highest honors of his profession;
and Julian might have raised himself to the rank of minister, or
general, of the state in which he was born a private citizen. If the
jealous caprice of power had disappointed his expectations, if he had
prudently declined the paths of greatness, the employment of the same
talents in studious solitude would have placed beyond the reach of
kings his present happiness and his immortal fame. When we inspect,
with minute, or perhaps malevolent attention, the portrait of Julian,
something seems wanting to the grace and perfection of the whole figure.
His genius was less powerful and sublime than that of Caesar; nor did
he possess the consummate prudence of Augustus. The virtues of Trajan
appear more steady and natural, and the philosophy of Marcus is more
simple and consistent. Yet Julian sustained adversity with firmness, and
prosperity with moderation. After an interval of one hundred and twenty
years from the death of Alexander Severus, the Romans beheld an emperor
who made no distinction between his duties and his pleasures; who
labored to relieve the distress, and to revive the spirit, of his
subjects; and who endeavored always to connect authority with merit,
and happiness with virtue. Even faction, and religious faction, was
constrained to acknowledge the superiority of his genius, in peace as
well as in war, and to confess, with a sigh, that the apostate Julian
was a lover of his country, and that he deserved the empire of the
world. [85]

The consciousness of a generous sentiment seems to have raised the
Christian post above his usual mediocrity.]
