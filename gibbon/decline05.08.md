## Chapter L: Description Of Arabia And Its Inhabitants.--Part II.

The slaves of domestic tyranny may vainly exult in their national
independence: but the Arab is personally free; and he enjoys, in some
degree, the benefits of society, without forfeiting the prerogatives
of nature. In every tribe, superstition, or gratitude, or fortune,
has exalted a particular family above the heads of their equals. The
dignities of sheick and emir invariably descend in this chosen race; but
the order of succession is loose and precarious; and the most worthy or
aged of the noble kinsmen are preferred to the simple, though important,
office of composing disputes by their advice, and guiding valor by their
example. Even a female of sense and spirit has been permitted to command
the countrymen of Zenobia. [31] The momentary junction of several tribes
produces an army: their more lasting union constitutes a nation; and
the supreme chief, the emir of emirs, whose banner is displayed at their
head, may deserve, in the eyes of strangers, the honors of the kingly
name.

If the Arabian princes abuse their power, they are quickly punished by
the desertion of their subjects, who had been accustomed to a mild and
parental jurisdiction. Their spirit is free, their steps are unconfined,
the desert is open, and the tribes and families are held together by a
mutual and voluntary compact. The softer natives of Yemen supported
the pomp and majesty of a monarch; but if he could not leave his palace
without endangering his life, [32] the active powers of government must
have been devolved on his nobles and magistrates. The cities of Mecca
and Medina present, in the heart of Asia, the form, or rather the
substance, of a commonwealth. The grandfather of Mahomet, and his lineal
ancestors, appear in foreign and domestic transactions as the princes of
their country; but they reigned, like Pericles at Athens, or the
Medici at Florence, by the opinion of their wisdom and integrity;
their influence was divided with their patrimony; and the sceptre was
transferred from the uncles of the prophet to a younger branch of the
tribe of Koreish. On solemn occasions they convened the assembly of
the people; and, since mankind must be either compelled or persuaded to
obey, the use and reputation of oratory among the ancient Arabs is the
clearest evidence of public freedom. [33] But their simple freedom was
of a very different cast from the nice and artificial machinery of the
Greek and Roman republics, in which each member possessed an undivided
share of the civil and political rights of the community. In the more
simple state of the Arabs, the nation is free, because each of her
sons disdains a base submission to the will of a master. His breast is
fortified by the austere virtues of courage, patience, and sobriety; the
love of independence prompts him to exercise the habits of self-command;
and the fear of dishonor guards him from the meaner apprehension of
pain, of danger, and of death. The gravity and firmness of the mind is
conspicuous in his outward demeanor; his speech is low, weighty, and
concise; he is seldom provoked to laughter; his only gesture is that of
stroking his beard, the venerable symbol of manhood; and the sense of
his own importance teaches him to accost his equals without levity, and
his superiors without awe. [34] The liberty of the Saracens survived
their conquests: the first caliphs indulged the bold and familiar
language of their subjects; they ascended the pulpit to persuade and
edify the congregation; nor was it before the seat of empire was
removed to the Tigris, that the Abbasides adopted the proud and pompous
ceremonial of the Persian and Byzantine courts.

[Footnote 31: Saraceni... mulieres aiunt in eos regnare, (Expositio
totius Mundi, p. 3, in Hudson, tom. iii.) The reign of Mavia is famous
in ecclesiastical story Pocock, Specimen, p. 69, 83.]

[Footnote 32: The report of Agatharcides, (de Mari Rubro, p. 63, 64, in
Hudson, tom. i.) Diodorus Siculus, (tom. i. l. iii. c. 47, p. 215,) and
Strabo, (l. xvi. p. 1124.) But I much suspect that this is one of
the popular tales, or extraordinary accidents, which the credulity of
travellers so often transforms into a fact, a custom, and a law.]

[Footnote 33: Non gloriabantur antiquitus Arabes, nisi gladio, hospite,
et eloquentia (Sephadius apud Pocock, Specimen, p. 161, 162.) This gift
of speech they shared only with the Persians; and the sententious
Arabs would probably have disdained the simple and sublime logic of
Demosthenes.]

[Footnote 34: I must remind the reader that D'Arvieux, D'Herbelot,
and Niebuhr, represent, in the most lively colors, the manners and
government of the Arabs, which are illustrated by many incidental
passages in the Life of Mahomet. * Note: See, likewise the curious
romance of Antar, the most vivid and authentic picture of Arabian
manners.--M.]

In the study of nations and men, we may observe the causes that render
them hostile or friendly to each other, that tend to narrow or enlarge,
to mollify or exasperate, the social character. The separation of the
Arabs from the rest of mankind has accustomed them to confound the ideas
of stranger and enemy; and the poverty of the land has introduced a
maxim of jurisprudence, which they believe and practise to the present
hour. They pretend, that, in the division of the earth, the rich and
fertile climates were assigned to the other branches of the human
family; and that the posterity of the outlaw Ismael might recover, by
fraud or force, the portion of inheritance of which he had been unjustly
deprived. According to the remark of Pliny, the Arabian tribes are
equally addicted to theft and merchandise; the caravans that traverse
the desert are ransomed or pillaged; and their neighbors, since the
remote times of Job and Sesostris, [35] have been the victims of
their rapacious spirit. If a Bedoween discovers from afar a solitary
traveller, he rides furiously against him, crying, with a loud voice,
"Undress thyself, thy aunt (my wife) is without a garment." A ready
submission entitles him to mercy; resistance will provoke the aggressor,
and his own blood must expiate the blood which he presumes to shed in
legitimate defence. A single robber, or a few associates, are branded
with their genuine name; but the exploits of a numerous band assume the
character of lawful and honorable war. The temper of a people thus armed
against mankind was doubly inflamed by the domestic license of rapine,
murder, and revenge. In the constitution of Europe, the right of peace
and war is now confined to a small, and the actual exercise to a much
smaller, list of respectable potentates; but each Arab, with impunity
and renown, might point his javelin against the life of his countrymen.
The union of the nation consisted only in a vague resemblance of
language and manners; and in each community, the jurisdiction of
the magistrate was mute and impotent. Of the time of ignorance which
preceded Mahomet, seventeen hundred battles [36] are recorded by
tradition: hostility was imbittered with the rancor of civil faction;
and the recital, in prose or verse, of an obsolete feud, was sufficient
to rekindle the same passions among the descendants of the hostile
tribes. In private life every man, at least every family, was the judge
and avenger of his own cause. The nice sensibility of honor, which
weighs the insult rather than the injury, sheds its deadly venom on the
quarrels of the Arabs: the honor of their women, and of their beards,
is most easily wounded; an indecent action, a contemptuous word, can be
expiated only by the blood of the offender; and such is their patient
inveteracy, that they expect whole months and years the opportunity of
revenge. A fine or compensation for murder is familiar to the Barbarians
of every age: but in Arabia the kinsmen of the dead are at liberty to
accept the atonement, or to exercise with their own hands the law of
retaliation. The refined malice of the Arabs refuses even the head
of the murderer, substitutes an innocent for the guilty person, and
transfers the penalty to the best and most considerable of the race
by whom they have been injured. If he falls by their hands, they are
exposed, in their turn, to the danger of reprisals, the interest and
principal of the bloody debt are accumulated: the individuals of
either family lead a life of malice and suspicion, and fifty years may
sometimes elapse before the account of vengeance be finally settled.
[37] This sanguinary spirit, ignorant of pity or forgiveness, has been
moderated, however, by the maxims of honor, which require in every
private encounter some decent equality of age and strength, of numbers
and weapons. An annual festival of two, perhaps of four, months, was
observed by the Arabs before the time of Mahomet, during which their
swords were religiously sheathed both in foreign and domestic hostility;
and this partial truce is more strongly expressive of the habits of
anarchy and warfare. [38]

[Footnote 35: Observe the first chapter of Job, and the long wall of
1500 stadia which Sesostris built from Pelusium to Heliopolis, (Diodor.
Sicul. tom. i. l. i. p. 67.) Under the name of Hycsos, the shepherd
kings, they had formerly subdued Egypt, (Marsham, Canon. Chron. p.
98-163) &c.) * Note: This origin of the Hycsos, though probable, is
by no means so certain here is some reason for supposing them
Scythians.--M]

[Footnote 36: Or, according to another account, 1200, (D'Herbelot,
Bibliotheque Orientale, p. 75: ) the two historians who wrote of the
Ayam al Arab, the battles of the Arabs, lived in the 9th and 10th
century. The famous war of Dahes and Gabrah was occasioned by two
horses, lasted forty years, and ended in a proverb, (Pocock, Specimen,
p. 48.)]

[Footnote 37: The modern theory and practice of the Arabs in the revenge
of murder are described by Niebuhr, (Description, p. 26-31.) The harsher
features of antiquity may be traced in the Koran, c. 2, p. 20, c. 17, p.
230, with Sale's Observations.]

[Footnote 38: Procopius (de Bell. Persic. l. i. c. 16) places the two
holy months about the summer solstice. The Arabians consecrate four
months of the year--the first, seventh, eleventh, and twelfth; and
pretend, that in a long series of ages the truce was infringed only four
or six times, (Sale's Preliminary Discourse, p. 147-150, and Notes
on the ixth chapter of the Koran, p. 154, &c. Casiri, Bibliot.
Hispano-Arabica, tom. ii. p. 20, 21.)]

But the spirit of rapine and revenge was attempered by the milder
influence of trade and literature. The solitary peninsula is encompassed
by the most civilized nations of the ancient world; the merchant is the
friend of mankind; and the annual caravans imported the first seeds
of knowledge and politeness into the cities, and even the camps of the
desert. Whatever may be the pedigree of the Arabs, their language is
derived from the same original stock with the Hebrew, the Syriac, and
the Chaldaean tongues; the independence of the tribes was marked by
their peculiar dialects; [39] but each, after their own, allowed a just
preference to the pure and perspicuous idiom of Mecca. In Arabia, as
well as in Greece, the perfection of language outstripped the refinement
of manners; and her speech could diversify the fourscore names of honey,
the two hundred of a serpent, the five hundred of a lion, the thousand
of a sword, at a time when this copious dictionary was intrusted to
the memory of an illiterate people. The monuments of the Homerites
were inscribed with an obsolete and mysterious character; but the Cufic
letters, the groundwork of the present alphabet, were invented on the
banks of the Euphrates; and the recent invention was taught at Mecca by
a stranger who settled in that city after the birth of Mahomet. The
arts of grammar, of metre, and of rhetoric, were unknown to the freeborn
eloquence of the Arabians; but their penetration was sharp, their
fancy luxuriant, their wit strong and sententious, [40] and their more
elaborate compositions were addressed with energy and effect to the
minds of their hearers. The genius and merit of a rising poet was
celebrated by the applause of his own and the kindred tribes. A solemn
banquet was prepared, and a chorus of women, striking their tymbals,
and displaying the pomp of their nuptials, sung in the presence of their
sons and husbands the felicity of their native tribe; that a champion
had now appeared to vindicate their rights; that a herald had raised
his voice to immortalize their renown. The distant or hostile tribes
resorted to an annual fair, which was abolished by the fanaticism of the
first Moslems; a national assembly that must have contributed to refine
and harmonize the Barbarians. Thirty days were employed in the exchange,
not only of corn and wine, but of eloquence and poetry. The prize
was disputed by the generous emulation of the bards; the victorious
performance was deposited in the archives of princes and emirs; and
we may read in our own language, the seven original poems which were
inscribed in letters of gold, and suspended in the temple of Mecca. [41]
The Arabian poets were the historians and moralists of the age; and
if they sympathized with the prejudices, they inspired and crowned the
virtues, of their countrymen. The indissoluble union of generosity and
valor was the darling theme of their song; and when they pointed
their keenest satire against a despicable race, they affirmed, in the
bitterness of reproach, that the men knew not how to give, nor the women
to deny. [42] The same hospitality, which was practised by Abraham, and
celebrated by Homer, is still renewed in the camps of the Arabs. The
ferocious Bedoweens, the terror of the desert, embrace, without inquiry
or hesitation, the stranger who dares to confide in their honor and to
enter their tent. His treatment is kind and respectful: he shares the
wealth, or the poverty, of his host; and, after a needful repose, he
is dismissed on his way, with thanks, with blessings, and perhaps with
gifts. The heart and hand are more largely expanded by the wants of a
brother or a friend; but the heroic acts that could deserve the public
applause, must have surpassed the narrow measure of discretion and
experience. A dispute had arisen, who, among the citizens of Mecca, was
entitled to the prize of generosity; and a successive application was
made to the three who were deemed most worthy of the trial. Abdallah,
the son of Abbas, had undertaken a distant journey, and his foot was in
the stirrup when he heard the voice of a suppliant, "O son of the uncle
of the apostle of God, I am a traveller, and in distress!" He instantly
dismounted to present the pilgrim with his camel, her rich caparison,
and a purse of four thousand pieces of gold, excepting only the sword,
either for its intrinsic value, or as the gift of an honored kinsman.
The servant of Kais informed the second suppliant that his master was
asleep: but he immediately added, "Here is a purse of seven thousand
pieces of gold, (it is all we have in the house,) and here is an order,
that will entitle you to a camel and a slave;" the master, as soon as
he awoke, praised and enfranchised his faithful steward, with a gentle
reproof, that by respecting his slumbers he had stinted his bounty.
The third of these heroes, the blind Arabah, at the hour of prayer, was
supporting his steps on the shoulders of two slaves. "Alas!" he replied,
"my coffers are empty! but these you may sell; if you refuse, I renounce
them." At these words, pushing away the youths, he groped along the wall
with his staff.

The character of Hatem is the perfect model of Arabian virtue: [43] he
was brave and liberal, an eloquent poet, and a successful robber; forty
camels were roasted at his hospitable feast; and at the prayer of a
suppliant enemy he restored both the captives and the spoil. The freedom
of his countrymen disdained the laws of justice; they proudly indulged
the spontaneous impulse of pity and benevolence.

[Footnote 39: Arrian, in the second century, remarks (in Periplo Maris
Erythraei, p. 12) the partial or total difference of the dialects of
the Arabs. Their language and letters are copiously treated by Pocock,
(Specimen, p. 150-154,) Casiri, (Bibliot. Hispano-Arabica, tom. i. p.
1, 83, 292, tom. ii. p. 25, &c.,) and Niebuhr, (Description de l'Arabie,
p. 72-36) I pass slightly; I am not fond of repeating words like a
parrot.]

[Footnote 40: A familiar tale in Voltaire's Zadig (le Chien et le
Cheval) is related, to prove the natural sagacity of the Arabs,
(D'Herbelot, Bibliot. Orient. p. 120, 121. Gagnier, Vie de Mahomet, tom.
i. p. 37-46: ) but D'Arvieux, or rather La Roque, (Voyage de Palestine,
p. 92,) denies the boasted superiority of the Bedoweens. The one hundred
and sixty-nine sentences of Ali (translated by Ockley, London, 1718)
afford a just and favorable specimen of Arabian wit. * Note: Compare the
Arabic proverbs translated by Burckhardt. London. 1830--M.]

[Footnote 41: Pocock (Specimen, p. 158-161) and Casiri (Bibliot.
Hispano-Arabica, tom. i. p. 48, 84, &c., 119, tom. ii. p. 17, &c.) speak
of the Arabian poets before Mahomet; the seven poems of the Caaba
have been published in English by Sir William Jones; but his honorable
mission to India has deprived us of his own notes, far more interesting
than the obscure and obsolete text.]

[Footnote 42: Sale's Preliminary Discourse, p. 29, 30]

[Footnote 43: D'Herbelot, Bibliot. Orient. p. 458. Gagnier, Vie de
Mahomet, tom. iii. p. 118. Caab and Hesnus (Pocock, Specimen, p. 43, 46,
48) were likewise conspicuous for their liberality; and the latter
is elegantly praised by an Arabian poet: "Videbis eum cum accesseris
exultantem, ac si dares illi quod ab illo petis." * Note: See the
translation of the amusing Persian romance of Hatim Tai, by Duncan
Forbes, Esq., among the works published by the Oriental Translation
Fund.--M.]

The religion of the Arabs, [44] as well as of the Indians, consisted in
the worship of the sun, the moon, and the fixed stars; a primitive and
specious mode of superstition. The bright luminaries of the sky display
the visible image of a Deity: their number and distance convey to a
philosophic, or even a vulgar, eye, the idea of boundless space:
the character of eternity is marked on these solid globes, that seem
incapable of corruption or decay: the regularity of their motions may
be ascribed to a principle of reason or instinct; and their real, or
imaginary, influence encourages the vain belief that the earth and
its inhabitants are the object of their peculiar care. The science of
astronomy was cultivated at Babylon; but the school of the Arabs was
a clear firmament and a naked plain. In their nocturnal marches, they
steered by the guidance of the stars: their names, and order, and daily
station, were familiar to the curiosity and devotion of the Bedoween;
and he was taught by experience to divide, in twenty-eight parts, the
zodiac of the moon, and to bless the constellations who refreshed, with
salutary rains, the thirst of the desert. The reign of the heavenly orbs
could not be extended beyond the visible sphere; and some metaphysical
powers were necessary to sustain the transmigration of souls and the
resurrection of bodies: a camel was left to perish on the grave, that he
might serve his master in another life; and the invocation of departed
spirits implies that they were still endowed with consciousness and
power. I am ignorant, and I am careless, of the blind mythology of the
Barbarians; of the local deities, of the stars, the air, and the earth,
of their sex or titles, their attributes or subordination. Each tribe,
each family, each independent warrior, created and changed the rites and
the object of his fantastic worship; but the nation, in every age, has
bowed to the religion, as well as to the language, of Mecca. The genuine
antiquity of the Caaba ascends beyond the Christian aera; in describing
the coast of the Red Sea, the Greek historian Diodorus [45] has
remarked, between the Thamudites and the Sabaeans, a famous temple,
whose superior sanctity was revered by all the Arabians; the linen or
silken veil, which is annually renewed by the Turkish emperor, was first
offered by a pious king of the Homerites, who reigned seven hundred
years before the time of Mahomet. [46] A tent, or a cavern, might
suffice for the worship of the savages, but an edifice of stone and clay
has been erected in its place; and the art and power of the monarchs
of the East have been confined to the simplicity of the original model.
[47] A spacious portico encloses the quadrangle of the Caaba; a square
chapel, twenty-four cubits long, twenty-three broad, and twenty-seven
high: a door and a window admit the light; the double roof is supported
by three pillars of wood; a spout (now of gold) discharges the
rain-water, and the well Zemzen is protected by a dome from accidental
pollution. The tribe of Koreish, by fraud and force, had acquired the
custody of the Caaba: the sacerdotal office devolved through four
lineal descents to the grandfather of Mahomet; and the family of the
Hashemites, from whence he sprung, was the most respectable and sacred
in the eyes of their country. [48] The precincts of Mecca enjoyed the
rights of sanctuary; and, in the last month of each year, the city and
the temple were crowded with a long train of pilgrims, who presented
their vows and offerings in the house of God. The same rites which are
now accomplished by the faithful Mussulman, were invented and practised
by the superstition of the idolaters. At an awful distance they cast
away their garments: seven times, with hasty steps, they encircled the
Caaba, and kissed the black stone: seven times they visited and adored
the adjacent mountains; seven times they threw stones into the valley
of Mina; and the pilgrimage was achieved, as at the present hour, by a
sacrifice of sheep and camels, and the burial of their hair and nails
in the consecrated ground. Each tribe either found or introduced in the
Caaba their domestic worship: the temple was adorned, or defiled, with
three hundred and sixty idols of men, eagles, lions, and antelopes; and
most conspicuous was the statue of Hebal, of red agate, holding in
his hand seven arrows, without heads or feathers, the instruments and
symbols of profane divination. But this statue was a monument of Syrian
arts: the devotion of the ruder ages was content with a pillar or a
tablet; and the rocks of the desert were hewn into gods or altars, in
imitation of the black stone [49] of Mecca, which is deeply tainted with
the reproach of an idolatrous origin. From Japan to Peru, the use of
sacrifice has universally prevailed; and the votary has expressed his
gratitude, or fear, by destroying or consuming, in honor of the gods,
the dearest and most precious of their gifts. The life of a man [50] is
the most precious oblation to deprecate a public calamity: the altars of
Phoenicia and Egypt, of Rome and Carthage, have been polluted with human
gore: the cruel practice was long preserved among the Arabs; in the
third century, a boy was annually sacrificed by the tribe of the
Dumatians; [51] and a royal captive was piously slaughtered by the
prince of the Saracens, the ally and soldier of the emperor Justinian.
[52] A parent who drags his son to the altar, exhibits the most painful
and sublime effort of fanaticism: the deed, or the intention, was
sanctified by the example of saints and heroes; and the father of
Mahomet himself was devoted by a rash vow, and hardly ransomed for the
equivalent of a hundred camels. In the time of ignorance, the Arabs,
like the Jews and Egyptians, abstained from the taste of swine's flesh;
[53] they circumcised [54] their children at the age of puberty: the
same customs, without the censure or the precept of the Koran, have
been silently transmitted to their posterity and proselytes. It has
been sagaciously conjectured, that the artful legislator indulged the
stubborn prejudices of his countrymen. It is more simple to believe that
he adhered to the habits and opinions of his youth, without foreseeing
that a practice congenial to the climate of Mecca might become useless
or inconvenient on the banks of the Danube or the Volga.

[Footnote 44: Whatever can now be known of the idolatry of the ancient
Arabians may be found in Pocock, (Specimen, p. 89-136, 163, 164.) His
profound erudition is more clearly and concisely interpreted by Sale,
(Preliminary Discourse, p. 14-24;) and Assemanni (Bibliot. Orient tom.
iv. p. 580-590) has added some valuable remarks.]

[Footnote 45: (Diodor. Sicul. tom. i. l. iii. p. 211.) The character and
position are so correctly apposite, that I am surprised how this curious
passage should have been read without notice or application. Yet this
famous temple had been overlooked by Agatharcides, (de Mari Rubro,
p. 58, in Hudson, tom. i.,) whom Diodorus copies in the rest of the
description. Was the Sicilian more knowing than the Egyptian? Or was the
Caaba built between the years of Rome 650 and 746, the dates of their
respective histories? (Dodwell, in Dissert. ad tom. i. Hudson, p.
72. Fabricius, Bibliot. Graec. tom. ii. p. 770.) * Note: Mr. Forster
(Geography of Arabia, vol. ii. p. 118, et seq.) has raised an objection,
as I think, fatal to this hypothesis of Gibbon. The temple, situated in
the country of the Banizomeneis, was not between the Thamudites and
the Sabaeans, but higher up than the coast inhabited by the former. Mr.
Forster would place it as far north as Moiiah. I am not quite satisfied
that this will agree with the whole description of Diodorus--M. 1845.]

[Footnote 46: Pocock, Specimen, p. 60, 61. From the death of Mahomet we
ascend to 68, from his birth to 129, years before the Christian aera.
The veil or curtain, which is now of silk and gold, was no more than a
piece of Egyptian linen, (Abulfeda, in Vit. Mohammed. c. 6, p. 14.)]

[Footnote 47: The original plan of the Caaba (which is servilely copied
in Sale, the Universal History, &c.) was a Turkish draught, which Reland
(de Religione Mohammedica, p. 113-123) has corrected and explained
from the best authorities. For the description and legend of the Caaba,
consult Pocock, (Specimen, p. 115-122,) the Bibliotheque Orientale
of D'Herbelot, (Caaba, Hagir, Zemzem, &c.,) and Sale (Preliminary
Discourse, p. 114-122.)]

[Footnote 48: Cosa, the fifth ancestor of Mahomet, must have usurped the
Caaba A.D. 440; but the story is differently told by Jannabi, (Gagnier,
Vie de Mahomet, tom. i. p. 65-69,) and by Abulfeda, (in Vit. Moham. c.
6, p. 13.)]

[Footnote 49: In the second century, Maximus of Tyre attributes to the
Arabs the worship of a stone, (Dissert. viii. tom. i. p. 142, edit.
Reiske;) and the reproach is furiously reechoed by the Christians,
(Clemens Alex. in Protreptico, p. 40. Arnobius contra Gentes, l. vi.
p. 246.) Yet these stones were no other than of Syria and Greece, so
renowned in sacred and profane antiquity, (Euseb. Praep. Evangel. l. i.
p. 37. Marsham, Canon. Chron. p. 54-56.)]

the learned Sir John Marsham, (Canon. Chron. p. 76-78, 301-304.)
Sanchoniatho derives the Phoenician sacrifices from the example of
Chronus; but we are ignorant whether Chronus lived before, or after,
Abraham, or indeed whether he lived at all.]

[Footnote 51: The reproach of Porphyry; but he likewise imputes to the
Roman the same barbarous custom, which, A. U. C. 657, had been finally
abolished. Dumaetha, Daumat al Gendai, is noticed by Ptolemy (Tabul.
p. 37, Arabia, p. 9-29) and Abulfeda, (p. 57,) and may be found in
D'Anville's maps, in the mid-desert between Chaibar and Tadmor.]

[Footnote 52: Prcoopius, (de Bell. Persico, l. i. c. 28,) Evagrius,
(l. vi. c. 21,) and Pocock, (Specimen, p. 72, 86,) attest the human
sacrifices of the Arabs in the vith century. The danger and escape of
Abdallah is a tradition rather than a fact, (Gagnier, Vie de Mahomet,
tom. i. p. 82-84.)]

[Footnote 53: Suillis carnibus abstinent, says Solinus, (Polyhistor. c.
33,) who copies Pliny (l. viii. c. 68) in the strange supposition, that
hogs can not live in Arabia. The Egyptians were actuated by a natural
and superstitious horror for that unclean beast, (Marsham, Canon. p.
205.) The old Arabians likewise practised, post coitum, the rite of
ablution, (Herodot. l. i. c. 80,) which is sanctified by the Mahometan
law, (Reland, p. 75, &c., Chardin, or rather the Mollah of Shah Abbas,
tom. iv. p. 71, &c.)]

[Footnote 54: The Mahometan doctors are not fond of the subject; yet
they hold circumcision necessary to salvation, and even pretend that
Mahomet was miraculously born without a foreskin, (Pocock, Specimen, p.
319, 320. Sale's Preliminary Discourse, p. 106, 107.)]
