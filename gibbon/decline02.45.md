## Chapter XXIV: The Retreat And Death Of Julian.--Part III.

The fields of Assyria were devoted by Julian to the calamities of war;
and the philosopher retaliated on a guiltless people the acts of rapine
and cruelty which had been committed by their haughty master in the
Roman provinces. The trembling Assyrians summoned the rivers to their
assistance; and completed, with their own hands, the ruin of their
country. The roads were rendered impracticable; a flood of waters was
poured into the camp; and, during several days, the troops of Julian
were obliged to contend with the most discouraging hardships. But every
obstacle was surmounted by the perseverance of the legionaries, who were
inured to toil as well as to danger, and who felt themselves animated
by the spirit of their leader. The damage was gradually repaired;
the waters were restored to their proper channels; whole groves of
palm-trees were cut down, and placed along the broken parts of the road;
and the army passed over the broad and deeper canals, on bridges of
floating rafts, which were supported by the help of bladders. Two cities
of Assyria presumed to resist the arms of a Roman emperor: and they
both paid the severe penalty of their rashness. At the distance of fifty
miles from the royal residence of Ctesiphon, Perisabor, [57a] or Anbar,
held the second rank in the province; a city, large, populous, and well
fortified, surrounded with a double wall, almost encompassed by a branch
of the Euphrates, and defended by the valor of a numerous garrison. The
exhortations of Hormisdas were repulsed with contempt; and the ears of
the Persian prince were wounded by a just reproach, that, unmindful of
his royal birth, he conducted an army of strangers against his king and
country. The Assyrians maintained their loyalty by a skilful, as well
as vigorous, defence; till the lucky stroke of a battering-ram, having
opened a large breach, by shattering one of the angles of the wall, they
hastily retired into the fortifications of the interior citadel. The
soldiers of Julian rushed impetuously into the town, and after the
full gratification of every military appetite, Perisabor was reduced to
ashes; and the engines which assaulted the citadel were planted on the
ruins of the smoking houses. The contest was continued by an incessant
and mutual discharge of missile weapons; and the superiority which the
Romans might derive from the mechanical powers of their balistae and
catapultae was counterbalanced by the advantage of the ground on the
side of the besieged. But as soon as an Helepolis had been constructed,
which could engage on equal terms with the loftiest ramparts, the
tremendous aspect of a moving turret, that would leave no hope of
resistance or mercy, terrified the defenders of the citadel into an
humble submission; and the place was surrendered only two days after
Julian first appeared under the walls of Perisabor. Two thousand five
hundred persons, of both sexes, the feeble remnant of a flourishing
people, were permitted to retire; the plentiful magazines of corn,
of arms, and of splendid furniture, were partly distributed among the
troops, and partly reserved for the public service; the useless stores
were destroyed by fire or thrown into the stream of the Euphrates; and
the fate of Amida was revenged by the total ruin of Perisabor.

[Footnote 57a: Libanius says that it was a great city of Assyria,
called after the name of the reigning king. The orator of Antioch is not
mistaken. The Persians and Syrians called it Fyrouz Schapour or Fyrouz
Schahbour; in Persian, the victory of Schahpour. It owed that name to
Sapor the First. It was before called Anbar St. Martin, iii. 85.--M.]

The city or rather fortress, of Maogamalcha, which was defended by
sixteen large towers, a deep ditch, and two strong and solid walls of
brick and bitumen, appears to have been constructed at the distance of
eleven miles, as the safeguard of the capital of Persia. The emperor,
apprehensive of leaving such an important fortress in his rear,
immediately formed the siege of Maogamalcha; and the Roman army was
distributed, for that purpose, into three divisions. Victor, at the head
of the cavalry, and of a detachment of heavy-armed foot, was ordered to
clear the country, as far as the banks of the Tigris, and the suburbs of
Ctesiphon. The conduct of the attack was assumed by Julian himself, who
seemed to place his whole dependence in the military engines which
he erected against the walls; while he secretly contrived a more
efficacious method of introducing his troops into the heart of the city
Under the direction of Nevitta and Dagalaiphus, the trenches were opened
at a considerable distance, and gradually prolonged as far as the edge
of the ditch. The ditch was speedily filled with earth; and, by the
incessant labor of the troops, a mine was carried under the foundations
of the walls, and sustained, at sufficient intervals, by props of
timber. Three chosen cohorts, advancing in a single file, silently
explored the dark and dangerous passage; till their intrepid leader
whispered back the intelligence, that he was ready to issue from his
confinement into the streets of the hostile city. Julian checked their
ardor, that he might insure their success; and immediately diverted
the attention of the garrison, by the tumult and clamor of a general
assault. The Persians, who, from their walls, contemptuously beheld the
progress of an impotent attack, celebrated with songs of triumph the
glory of Sapor; and ventured to assure the emperor, that he might
ascend the starry mansion of Ormusd, before he could hope to take the
impregnable city of Maogamalcha. The city was already taken. History has
recorded the name of a private soldier the first who ascended from the
mine into a deserted tower. The passage was widened by his companions,
who pressed forwards with impatient valor. Fifteen hundred enemies were
already in the midst of the city. The astonished garrison abandoned the
walls, and their only hope of safety; the gates were instantly burst
open; and the revenge of the soldier, unless it were suspended by lust
or avarice, was satiated by an undistinguishing massacre. The governor,
who had yielded on a promise of mercy, was burnt alive, a few days
afterwards, on a charge of having uttered some disrespectful words
against the honor of Prince Hormisdas. The fortifications were razed to
the ground; and not a vestige was left, that the city of Maogamalcha had
ever existed. The neighborhood of the capital of Persia was adorned with
three stately palaces, laboriously enriched with every production that
could gratify the luxury and pride of an Eastern monarch. The pleasant
situation of the gardens along the banks of the Tigris, was improved,
according to the Persian taste, by the symmetry of flowers, fountains,
and shady walks: and spacious parks were enclosed for the reception
of the bears, lions, and wild boars, which were maintained at a
considerable expense for the pleasure of the royal chase. The park walls
were broken down, the savage game was abandoned to the darts of the
soldiers, and the palaces of Sapor were reduced to ashes, by the command
of the Roman emperor. Julian, on this occasion, showed himself ignorant,
or careless, of the laws of civility, which the prudence and refinement
of polished ages have established between hostile princes. Yet these
wanton ravages need not excite in our breasts any vehement emotions of
pity or resentment. A simple, naked statue, finished by the hand of a
Grecian artist, is of more genuine value than all these rude and costly
monuments of Barbaric labor; and, if we are more deeply affected by the
ruin of a palace than by the conflagration of a cottage, our humanity
must have formed a very erroneous estimate of the miseries of human
life. [57]

[Footnote 57a: And as guilty of a double treachery, having first engaged
to surrender the city, and afterwards valiantly defended it. Gibbon,
perhaps, should have noticed this charge, though he may have rejected it
as improbable Compare Zosimus. iii. 23.--M.]

[Footnote 57: The operations of the Assyrian war are circumstantially
related by Ammianus, (xxiv. 2, 3, 4, 5,) Libanius, (Orat. Parent.
c. 112-123, p. 335-347,) Zosimus, (l. iii. p. 168-180,) and Gregory
Nazianzen, (Orat iv. p. 113, 144.) The military criticisms of the saint
are devoutly copied by Tillemont, his faithful slave.]

Julian was an object of hatred and terror to the Persian and the
painters of that nation represented the invader of their country under
the emblem of a furious lion, who vomited from his mouth a consuming
fire. [58] To his friends and soldiers the philosophic hero appeared
in a more amiable light; and his virtues were never more conspicuously
displayed, than in the last and most active period of his life. He
practised, without effort, and almost without merit, the habitual
qualities of temperance and sobriety. According to the dictates of that
artificial wisdom, which assumes an absolute dominion over the mind
and body, he sternly refused himself the indulgence of the most natural
appetites. [59] In the warm climate of Assyria, which solicited a
luxurious people to the gratification of every sensual desire, [60] a
youthful conqueror preserved his chastity pure and inviolate; nor was
Julian ever tempted, even by a motive of curiosity, to visit his female
captives of exquisite beauty, [61] who, instead of resisting his power,
would have disputed with each other the honor of his embraces. With the
same firmness that he resisted the allurements of love, he sustained the
hardships of war. When the Romans marched through the flat and flooded
country, their sovereign, on foot, at the head of his legions, shared
their fatigues and animated their diligence. In every useful labor, the
hand of Julian was prompt and strenuous; and the Imperial purple was wet
and dirty as the coarse garment of the meanest soldier. The two sieges
allowed him some remarkable opportunities of signalizing his personal
valor, which, in the improved state of the military art, can seldom
be exerted by a prudent general. The emperor stood before the citadel
before the citadel of Perisabor, insensible of his extreme danger,
and encouraged his troops to burst open the gates of iron, till he was
almost overwhelmed under a cloud of missile weapons and huge stones,
that were directed against his person. As he examined the exterior
fortifications of Maogamalcha, two Persians, devoting themselves for
their country, suddenly rushed upon him with drawn cimeters: the emperor
dexterously received their blows on his uplifted shield; and, with a
steady and well-aimed thrust, laid one of his adversaries dead at
his feet. The esteem of a prince who possesses the virtues which he
approves, is the noblest recompense of a deserving subject; and the
authority which Julian derived from his personal merit, enabled him to
revive and enforce the rigor of ancient discipline. He punished with
death or ignominy the misbehavior of three troops of horse, who, in
a skirmish with the Surenas, had lost their honor and one of their
standards: and he distinguished with obsidional [62] crowns the valor of
the foremost soldiers, who had ascended into the city of Maogamalcha.

After the siege of Perisabor, the firmness of the emperor was exercised
by the insolent avarice of the army, who loudly complained, that their
services were rewarded by a trifling donative of one hundred pieces
of silver. His just indignation was expressed in the grave and manly
language of a Roman. "Riches are the object of your desires; those
riches are in the hands of the Persians; and the spoils of this fruitful
country are proposed as the prize of your valor and discipline. Believe
me," added Julian, "the Roman republic, which formerly possessed such
immense treasures, is now reduced to want and wretchedness once our
princes have been persuaded, by weak and interested ministers, to
purchase with gold the tranquillity of the Barbarians. The revenue is
exhausted; the cities are ruined; the provinces are dispeopled.
For myself, the only inheritance that I have received from my royal
ancestors is a soul incapable of fear; and as long as I am convinced
that every real advantage is seated in the mind, I shall not blush to
acknowledge an honorable poverty, which, in the days of ancient virtue,
was considered as the glory of Fabricius. That glory, and that virtue,
may be your own, if you will listen to the voice of Heaven and of your
leader. But if you will rashly persist, if you are determined to renew
the shameful and mischievous examples of old seditions, proceed. As
it becomes an emperor who has filled the first rank among men, I am
prepared to die, standing; and to despise a precarious life, which,
every hour, may depend on an accidental fever. If I have been found
unworthy of the command, there are now among you, (I speak it with pride
and pleasure,) there are many chiefs whose merit and experience are
equal to the conduct of the most important war. Such has been the
temper of my reign, that I can retire, without regret, and without
apprehension, to the obscurity of a private station" [63] The modest
resolution of Julian was answered by the unanimous applause and cheerful
obedience of the Romans, who declared their confidence of victory, while
they fought under the banners of their heroic prince. Their courage was
kindled by his frequent and familiar asseverations, (for such wishes
were the oaths of Julian,) "So may I reduce the Persians under the
yoke!" "Thus may I restore the strength and splendor of the republic!"
The love of fame was the ardent passion of his soul: but it was not
before he trampled on the ruins of Maogamalcha, that he allowed
himself to say, "We have now provided some materials for the sophist of
Antioch." [64]

[Footnote 58: Libanius de ulciscenda Juliani nece, c. 13, p. 162.]

[Footnote 59: The famous examples of Cyrus, Alexander, and Scipio, were
acts of justice. Julian's chastity was voluntary, and, in his opinion,
meritorious.]

[Footnote 60: Sallust (ap. Vet. Scholiast. Juvenal. Satir. i. 104)
observes, that nihil corruptius moribus. The matrons and virgins of
Babylon freely mingled with the men in licentious banquets; and as
they felt the intoxication of wine and love, they gradually, and
almost completely, threw aside the encumbrance of dress; ad ultimum ima
corporum velamenta projiciunt. Q. Curtius, v. 1.]

[Footnote 61: Ex virginibus autem quae speciosae sunt captae, et in
Perside, ubi faeminarum pulchritudo excellit, nec contrectare aliquam

small and ugly; but it has been improved by the perpetual mixture of
Circassian blood, (Herodot. l. iii. c. 97. Buffon, Hist. Naturelle, tom.
iii. p. 420.)]

[Footnote 62: Obsidionalibus coronis donati. Ammian. xxiv. 4. Either
Julian or his historian were unskillful antiquaries. He should have
given mural crowns. The obsidional were the reward of a general who had
delivered a besieged city, (Aulus Gellius, Noct. Attic. v. 6.)]

hear, could transcribe, and was incapable of inventing, it. I have used
some slight freedoms, and conclude with the most forcibic sentence.]

[Footnote 64: Ammian. xxiv. 3. Libanius, Orat. Parent. c. 122, p. 346.]

The successful valor of Julian had triumphed over all the obstacles that
opposed his march to the gates of Ctesiphon. But the reduction, or even
the siege, of the capital of Persia, was still at a distance: nor can
the military conduct of the emperor be clearly apprehended, without a
knowledge of the country which was the theatre of his bold and skilful
operations. [65] Twenty miles to the south of Bagdad, and on the eastern
bank of the Tigris, the curiosity of travellers has observed some ruins
of the palaces of Ctesiphon, which, in the time of Julian, was a great
and populous city. The name and glory of the adjacent Seleucia were
forever extinguished; and the only remaining quarter of that Greek
colony had resumed, with the Assyrian language and manners, the
primitive appellation of Coche. Coche was situate on the western side
of the Tigris; but it was naturally considered as a suburb of Ctesiphon,
with which we may suppose it to have been connected by a permanent
bridge of boats.

The united parts contribute to form the common epithet of Al Modain, the
cities, which the Orientals have bestowed on the winter residence of
the Sassinadees; and the whole circumference of the Persian capital was
strongly fortified by the waters of the river, by lofty walls, and by
impracticable morasses. Near the ruins of Seleucia, the camp of Julian
was fixed, and secured, by a ditch and rampart, against the sallies of
the numerous and enterprising garrison of Coche. In this fruitful and
pleasant country, the Romans were plentifully supplied with water and
forage: and several forts, which might have embarrassed the motions
of the army, submitted, after some resistance, to the efforts of their
valor. The fleet passed from the Euphrates into an artificial derivation
of that river, which pours a copious and navigable stream into the
Tigris, at a small distance below the great city. If they had followed
this royal canal, which bore the name of Nahar-Malcha, [66] the
intermediate situation of Coche would have separated the fleet and army
of Julian; and the rash attempt of steering against the current of the
Tigris, and forcing their way through the midst of a hostile capital,
must have been attended with the total destruction of the Roman navy.
The prudence of the emperor foresaw the danger, and provided the remedy.
As he had minutely studied the operations of Trajan in the same country,
he soon recollected that his warlike predecessor had dug a new and
navigable canal, which, leaving Coche on the right hand, conveyed the
waters of the Nahar-Malcha into the river Tigris, at some distance above
the cities. From the information of the peasants, Julian ascertained the
vestiges of this ancient work, which were almost obliterated by design
or accident. By the indefatigable labor of the soldiers, a broad and
deep channel was speedily prepared for the reception of the Euphrates.
A strong dike was constructed to interrupt the ordinary current of the
Nahar-Malcha: a flood of waters rushed impetuously into their new bed;
and the Roman fleet, steering their triumphant course into the Tigris,
derided the vain and ineffectual barriers which the Persians of
Ctesiphon had erected to oppose their passage.

[Footnote 65: M. d'Anville, (Mem. de l'Academie des Inscriptions, tom.
xxxviii p. 246-259) has ascertained the true position and distance of
Babylon, Seleucia, Ctesiphon, Bagdad, &c. The Roman traveller, Pietro
della Valle, (tom. i. lett. xvii. p. 650-780,) seems to be the most
intelligent spectator of that famous province. He is a gentleman and a
scholar, but intolerably vain and prolix.]

[Footnote 66: The Royal Canal (Nahar-Malcha) might be successively
restored, altered, divided, &c., (Cellarius, Geograph. Antiq. tom.
ii. p. 453;) and these changes may serve to explain the seeming
contradictions of antiquity. In the time of Julian, it must have fallen
into the Euphrates below Ctesiphon.]

As it became necessary to transport the Roman army over the Tigris,
another labor presented itself, of less toil, but of more danger, than
the preceding expedition. The stream was broad and rapid; the ascent
steep and difficult; and the intrenchments which had been formed on the
ridge of the opposite bank, were lined with a numerous army of heavy
cuirrasiers, dexterous archers, and huge elephants; who (according to
the extravagant hyperbole of Libanius) could trample with the same ease
a field of corn, or a legion of Romans. [67] In the presence of such an
enemy, the construction of a bridge was impracticable; and the intrepid
prince, who instantly seized the only possible expedient, concealed
his design, till the moment of execution, from the knowledge of the
Barbarians, of his own troops, and even of his generals themselves.
Under the specious pretence of examining the state of the magazines,
fourscore vessels [67a] were gradually unladen; and a select detachment,
apparently destined for some secret expedition, was ordered to stand to
their arms on the first signal. Julian disguised the silent anxiety of
his own mind with smiles of confidence and joy; and amused the hostile
nations with the spectacle of military games, which he insultingly
celebrated under the walls of Coche. The day was consecrated to
pleasure; but, as soon as the hour of supper was passed, the emperor
summoned the generals to his tent, and acquainted them that he had
fixed that night for the passage of the Tigris. They stood in silent
and respectful astonishment; but, when the venerable Sallust assumed the
privilege of his age and experience, the rest of the chiefs supported
with freedom the weight of his prudent remonstrances. [68] Julian
contented himself with observing, that conquest and safety depended on
the attempt; that instead of diminishing, the number of their enemies
would be increased, by successive reenforcements; and that a longer
delay would neither contract the breadth of the stream, nor level the
height of the bank. The signal was instantly given, and obeyed; the most
impatient of the legionaries leaped into five vessels that lay nearest
to the bank; and as they plied their oars with intrepid diligence, they
were lost, after a few moments, in the darkness of the night. A flame
arose on the opposite side; and Julian, who too clearly understood
that his foremost vessels, in attempting to land, had been fired by
the enemy, dexterously converted their extreme danger into a presage
of victory. "Our fellow-soldiers," he eagerly exclaimed, "are already
masters of the bank; see--they make the appointed signal; let us hasten
to emulate and assist their courage." The united and rapid motion of
a great fleet broke the violence of the current, and they reached the
eastern shore of the Tigris with sufficient speed to extinguish the
flames, and rescue their adventurous companions. The difficulties of a
steep and lofty ascent were increased by the weight of armor, and
the darkness of the night. A shower of stones, darts, and fire, was
incessantly discharged on the heads of the assailants; who, after
an arduous struggle, climbed the bank and stood victorious upon the
rampart. As soon as they possessed a more equal field, Julian, who, with
his light infantry, had led the attack, [69] darted through the ranks
a skilful and experienced eye: his bravest soldiers, according to the
precepts of Homer, [70] were distributed in the front and rear: and all
the trumpets of the Imperial army sounded to battle. The Romans, after
sending up a military shout, advanced in measured steps to the animating
notes of martial music; launched their formidable javelins; and rushed
forwards with drawn swords, to deprive the Barbarians, by a closer
onset, of the advantage of their missile weapons. The whole engagement
lasted above twelve hours; till the gradual retreat of the Persians
was changed into a disorderly flight, of which the shameful example
was given by the principal leader, and the Surenas himself. They were
pursued to the gates of Ctesiphon; and the conquerors might have entered
the dismayed city, [71] if their general, Victor, who was dangerously
wounded with an arrow, had not conjured them to desist from a rash
attempt, which must be fatal, if it were not successful. On their side,
the Romans acknowledged the loss of only seventy-five men; while they
affirmed, that the Barbarians had left on the field of battle two
thousand five hundred, or even six thousand, of their bravest soldiers.
The spoil was such as might be expected from the riches and luxury of
an Oriental camp; large quantities of silver and gold, splendid arms
and trappings, and beds and tables of massy silver. [71a] The victorious
emperor distributed, as the rewards of valor, some honorable gifts,
civic, and mural, and naval crowns; which he, and perhaps he alone,
esteemed more precious than the wealth of Asia. A solemn sacrifice was
offered to the god of war, but the appearances of the victims threatened
the most inauspicious events; and Julian soon discovered, by less
ambiguous signs, that he had now reached the term of his prosperity.

On the second day after the battle, the domestic guards, the Jovians and
Herculians, and the remaining troops, which composed near two thirds
of the whole army, were securely wafted over the Tigris. [73] While
the Persians beheld from the walls of Ctesiphon the desolation of the
adjacent country, Julian cast many an anxious look towards the North, in
full expectation, that as he himself had victoriously penetrated to the
capital of Sapor, the march and junction of his lieutenants, Sebastian
and Procopius, would be executed with the same courage and diligence.
His expectations were disappointed by the treachery of the Armenian
king, who permitted, and most probably directed, the desertion of
his auxiliary troops from the camp of the Romans; [74] and by the
dissensions of the two generals, who were incapable of forming or
executing any plan for the public service. When the emperor had
relinquished the hope of this important reenforcement, he condescended
to hold a council of war, and approved, after a full debate, the
sentiment of those generals, who dissuaded the siege of Ctesiphon, as a
fruitless and pernicious undertaking. It is not easy for us to conceive,
by what arts of fortification a city thrice besieged and taken by the
predecessors of Julian could be rendered impregnable against an army of
sixty thousand Romans, commanded by a brave and experienced general,
and abundantly supplied with ships, provisions, battering engines, and
military stores. But we may rest assured, from the love of glory, and
contempt of danger, which formed the character of Julian, that he was
not discouraged by any trivial or imaginary obstacles. [75] At the
very time when he declined the siege of Ctesiphon, he rejected, with
obstinacy and disdain, the most flattering offers of a negotiation of
peace. Sapor, who had been so long accustomed to the tardy ostentation
of Constantius, was surprised by the intrepid diligence of his
successor. As far as the confines of India and Scythia, the satraps
of the distant provinces were ordered to assemble their troops, and
to march, without delay, to the assistance of their monarch. But their
preparations were dilatory, their motions slow; and before Sapor could
lead an army into the field, he received the melancholy intelligence of
the devastation of Assyria, the ruin of his palaces, and the slaughter
of his bravest troops, who defended the passage of the Tigris. The pride
of royalty was humbled in the dust; he took his repasts on the ground;
and the disorder of his hair expressed the grief and anxiety of his
mind. Perhaps he would not have refused to purchase, with one half
of his kingdom, the safety of the remainder; and he would have gladly
subscribed himself, in a treaty of peace, the faithful and dependent
ally of the Roman conqueror. Under the pretence of private business, a
minister of rank and confidence was secretly despatched to embrace the
knees of Hormisdas, and to request, in the language of a suppliant, that
he might be introduced into the presence of the emperor. The Sassanian
prince, whether he listened to the voice of pride or humanity,
whether he consulted the sentiments of his birth, or the duties of his
situation, was equally inclined to promote a salutary measure, which
would terminate the calamities of Persia, and secure the triumph of
Rome. He was astonished by the inflexible firmness of a hero, who
remembered, most unfortunately for himself and for his country, that
Alexander had uniformly rejected the propositions of Darius. But as
Julian was sensible, that the hope of a safe and honorable peace might
cool the ardor of his troops, he earnestly requested that Hormisdas
would privately dismiss the minister of Sapor, and conceal this
dangerous temptation from the knowledge of the camp. [76]
