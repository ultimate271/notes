## Chapter XLIV: Idea Of The Roman Jurisprudence.--Part III.

Among savage nations, the want of letters is imperfectly supplied by
the use of visible signs, which awaken attention, and perpetuate the
remembrance of any public or private transaction. The jurisprudence of
the first Romans exhibited the scenes of a pantomime; the words were
adapted to the gestures, and the slightest error or neglect in the
forms of proceeding was sufficient to annul the substance of the fairest
claim. The communion of the marriage-life was denoted by the necessary
elements of fire and water; [49] and the divorced wife resigned the
bunch of keys, by the delivery of which she had been invested with the
government of the family. The manumission of a son, or a slave, was
performed by turning him round with a gentle blow on the cheek; a work
was prohibited by the casting of a stone; prescription was interrupted
by the breaking of a branch; the clinched fist was the symbol of a
pledge or deposit; the right hand was the gift of faith and confidence.
The indenture of covenants was a broken straw; weights and scales were
introduced into every payment, and the heir who accepted a testament was
sometimes obliged to snap his fingers, to cast away his garments, and to
leap or dance with real or affected transport. [50] If a citizen pursued
any stolen goods into a neighbor's house, he concealed his nakedness
with a linen towel, and hid his face with a mask or basin, lest he
should encounter the eyes of a virgin or a matron. [51] In a civil
action the plaintiff touched the ear of his witness, seized his
reluctant adversary by the neck, and implored, in solemn lamentation,
the aid of his fellow-citizens. The two competitors grasped each other's
hand as if they stood prepared for combat before the tribunal of the
praetor; he commanded them to produce the object of the dispute; they
went, they returned with measured steps, and a clod of earth was cast
at his feet to represent the field for which they contended. This occult
science of the words and actions of law was the inheritance of the
pontiffs and patricians. Like the Chaldean astrologers, they announced
to their clients the days of business and repose; these important
trifles were interwoven with the religion of Numa; and after the
publication of the Twelve Tables, the Roman people was still enslaved
by the ignorance of judicial proceedings. The treachery of some
plebeian officers at length revealed the profitable mystery: in a more
enlightened age, the legal actions were derided and observed; and the
same antiquity which sanctified the practice, obliterated the use and
meaning of this primitive language. [52]

[Footnote 49: Scaevola, most probably Q. Cervidius Scaevola; the master
of Papinian considers this acceptance of fire and water as the essence
of marriage, (Pandect. l. xxiv. tit. 1, leg. 66. See Heineccius, Hist.
J. R. No. 317.)]

[Footnote 50: Cicero (de Officiis, iii. 19) may state an ideal case, but
St. Am brose (de Officiis, iii. 2,) appeals to the practice of his own
times, which he understood as a lawyer and a magistrate, (Schulting
ad Ulpian, Fragment. tit. xxii. No. 28, p. 643, 644.) * Note: In
this passage the author has endeavored to collect all the examples of
judicial formularies which he could find. That which he adduces as the
form of cretio haereditatis is absolutely false. It is sufficient to
glance at the passage in Cicero which he cites, to see that it has no
relation to it. The author appeals to the opinion of Schulting, who, in
the passage quoted, himself protests against the ridiculous and absurd
interpretation of the passage in Cicero, and observes that Graevius had
already well explained the real sense. See in Gaius the form of cretio
haereditatis Inst. l. ii. p. 166.--W.]

[Footnote 51: The furtum lance licioque conceptum was no longer
understood in the time of the Antonines, (Aulus Gellius, xvi. 10.) The
Attic derivation of Heineccius, (Antiquitat. Rom. l. iv. tit. i. No.
13--21) is supported by the evidence of Aristophanes, his scholiast, and
Pollux. * Note: Nothing more is known of this ceremony; nevertheless
we find that already in his own days Gaius turned it into ridicule. He
says, (lib. iii. et p. 192, Sections 293,) prohibiti actio quadrupli
ex edicto praetoris introducta est; lex autem eo nomine nullam poenam
constituit. Hoc solum praecepit, ut qui quaerere velit, nudus quaerat,
linteo cinctus, lancem habens; qui si quid invenerit. jubet id lex
furtum manifestum esse. Quid sit autem linteum? quaesitum est. Sed
verius est consuti genus esse, quo necessariae partes tegerentur. Quare
lex tota ridicula est. Nam qui vestitum quaerere prohibet, is et nudum
quaerere prohibiturus est; eo magis, quod invenerit ibi imponat, neutrum
eorum procedit, si id quod quaeratur, ejus magnitudinis aut naturae
sit ut neque subjici, neque ibi imponi possit. Certe non dubitatur,
cujuscunque materiae sit ea lanx, satis legi fieri. We see moreover,
from this passage, that the basin, as most authors, resting on
the authority of Festus, have supposed, was not used to cover the
figure.--W. Gibbon says the face, though equally inaccurately. This
passage of Gaius, I must observe, as well as others in M. Warnkonig's
work, is very inaccurately printed.--M.]

[Footnote 52: In his Oration for Murena, (c. 9--13,) Cicero turns into
ridicule the forms and mysteries of the civilians, which are represented
with more candor by Aulus Gellius, (Noct. Attic. xx. 10,) Gravina, (Opp
p. 265, 266, 267,) and Heineccius, (Antiquitat. l. iv. tit. vi.) * Note:
Gibbon had conceived opinions too decided against the forms of procedure
in use among the Romans. Yet it is on these solemn forms that the
certainty of laws has been founded among all nations. Those of the
Romans were very intimately allied with the ancient religion, and
must of necessity have disappeared as Rome attained a higher degree
of civilization. Have not modern nations, even the most civilized,
overloaded their laws with a thousand forms, often absurd, almost always
trivial? How many examples are afforded by the English law! See, on the
nature of these forms, the work of M. de Savigny on the Vocation of our
Age for Legislation and Jurisprudence, Heidelberg, 1814, p. 9, 10.--W.
This work of M. Savigny has been translated into English by Mr.
Hayward.--M.]

A more liberal art was cultivated, however, by the sage of Rome, who, in
a stricter sense, may be considered as the authors of the civil law. The
alteration of the idiom and manners of the Romans rendered the style
of the Twelve Tables less familiar to each rising generation, and the
doubtful passages were imperfectly explained by the study of legal
antiquarians. To define the ambiguities, to circumscribe the latitude,
to apply the principles, to extend the consequences, to reconcile the
real or apparent contradictions, was a much nobler and more important
task; and the province of legislation was silently invaded by the
expounders of ancient statutes. Their subtle interpretations concurred
with the equity of the praetor, to reform the tyranny of the darker
ages: however strange or intricate the means, it was the aim of
artificial jurisprudence to restore the simple dictates of nature and
reason, and the skill of private citizens was usefully employed to
undermine the public institutions of their country. [521] The revolution
of almost one thousand years, from the Twelve Tables to the reign of
Justinian, may be divided into three periods, almost equal in duration,
and distinguished from each other by the mode of instruction and the
character of the civilians. [53] Pride and ignorance contributed, during
the first period, to confine within narrow limits the science of the
Roman law. On the public days of market or assembly, the masters of the
art were seen walking in the forum ready to impart the needful advice
to the meanest of their fellow-citizens, from whose votes, on a future
occasion, they might solicit a grateful return. As their years and
honors increased, they seated themselves at home on a chair or throne,
to expect with patient gravity the visits of their clients, who at the
dawn of day, from the town and country, began to thunder at their door.
The duties of social life, and the incidents of judicial proceeding,
were the ordinary subject of these consultations, and the verbal or
written opinion of the juris-consults was framed according to the rules
of prudence and law. The youths of their own order and family were
permitted to listen; their children enjoyed the benefit of more private
lessons, and the Mucian race was long renowned for the hereditary
knowledge of the civil law. The second period, the learned and splendid
age of jurisprudence, may be extended from the birth of Cicero to
the reign of Severus Alexander. A system was formed, schools were
instituted, books were composed, and both the living and the dead became
subservient to the instruction of the student. The tripartite of Aelius
Paetus, surnamed Catus, or the Cunning, was preserved as the oldest work
of Jurisprudence. Cato the censor derived some additional fame from his
legal studies, and those of his son: the kindred appellation of Mucius
Scaevola was illustrated by three sages of the law; but the perfection
of the science was ascribed to Servius Sulpicius, their disciple, and
the friend of Tully; and the long succession, which shone with equal
lustre under the republic and under the Caesars, is finally closed by
the respectable characters of Papinian, of Paul, and of Ulpian. Their
names, and the various titles of their productions, have been minutely
preserved, and the example of Labeo may suggest some idea of their
diligence and fecundity. That eminent lawyer of the Augustan age divided
the year between the city and country, between business and composition;
and four hundred books are enumerated as the fruit of his retirement. Of
the collection of his rival Capito, the two hundred and fifty-ninth book
is expressly quoted; and few teachers could deliver their opinions in
less than a century of volumes. In the third period, between the reigns
of Alexander and Justinian, the oracles of jurisprudence were almost
mute. The measure of curiosity had been filled: the throne was occupied
by tyrants and Barbarians, the active spirits were diverted by religious
disputes, and the professors of Rome, Constantinople, and Berytus,
were humbly content to repeat the lessons of their more enlightened
predecessors. From the slow advances and rapid decay of these legal
studies, it may be inferred, that they require a state of peace and
refinement. From the multitude of voluminous civilians who fill the
intermediate space, it is evident that such studies may be pursued,
and such works may be performed, with a common share of judgment,
experience, and industry. The genius of Cicero and Virgil was more
sensibly felt, as each revolving age had been found incapable of
producing a similar or a second: but the most eminent teachers of the
law were assured of leaving disciples equal or superior to themselves in
merit and reputation.

[Footnote 521: Compare, on the Responsa Prudentum, Warnkonig, Histoire
Externe du Droit Romain Bruxelles, 1836, p. 122.--M.]

[Footnote 53: The series of the civil lawyers is deduced by Pomponius,
(de Origine Juris Pandect. l. i. tit. ii.) The moderns have discussed,
with learning and criticism, this branch of literary history; and among
these I have chiefly been guided by Gravina (p. 41--79) and Hei neccius,
(Hist. J. R. No. 113-351.) Cicero, more especially in his books de
Oratore, de Claris Oratoribus, de Legibus, and the Clavie Ciceroniana
of Ernesti (under the names of Mucius, &c.) afford much genuine and
pleasing information. Horace often alludes to the morning labors of the
civilians, (Serm. I. i. 10, Epist. II. i. 103, &c)

     Agricolam laudat juris legumque peritus Sub galli cantum,
     consultor ubi ostia pulsat.
     ------------
     Romae dulce diu fuit et solemne, reclusa Mane domo vigilare,
     clienti promere jura.

* Note: It is particularly in this division of the history of
the Roman jurisprudence into epochs, that Gibbon displays his profound
knowledge of the laws of this people. M. Hugo, adopting this division,
prefaced these three periods with the history of the times anterior to
the Law of the Twelve Tables, which are, as it were, the infancy of the
Roman law.--W]

The jurisprudence which had been grossly adapted to the wants of the
first Romans, was polished and improved in the seventh century of the
city, by the alliance of Grecian philosophy. The Scaevolas had been
taught by use and experience; but Servius Sulpicius [5311] was the first
civilian who established his art on a certain and general theory. [54]
For the discernment of truth and falsehood he applied, as an infallible
rule, the logic of Aristotle and the stoics, reduced particular cases
to general principles, and diffused over the shapeless mass the light of
order and eloquence. Cicero, his contemporary and friend, declined the
reputation of a professed lawyer; but the jurisprudence of his country
was adorned by his incomparable genius, which converts into gold every
object that it touches. After the example of Plato, he composed a
republic; and, for the use of his republic, a treatise of laws; in which
he labors to deduce from a celestial origin the wisdom and justice of
the Roman constitution. The whole universe, according to his sublime
hypothesis, forms one immense commonwealth: gods and men, who
participate of the same essence, are members of the same community;
reason prescribes the law of nature and nations; and all positive
institutions, however modified by accident or custom, are drawn from
the rule of right, which the Deity has inscribed on every virtuous mind.
From these philosophical mysteries, he mildly excludes the sceptics
who refuse to believe, and the epicureans who are unwilling to act. The
latter disdain the care of the republic: he advises them to slumber in
their shady gardens. But he humbly entreats that the new academy would
be silent, since her bold objections would too soon destroy the fair and
well ordered structure of his lofty system. [55] Plato, Aristotle, and
Zeno, he represents as the only teachers who arm and instruct a citizen
for the duties of social life. Of these, the armor of the stoics [56]
was found to be of the firmest temper; and it was chiefly worn, both for
use and ornament, in the schools of jurisprudence. From the portico, the
Roman civilians learned to live, to reason, and to die: but they imbibed
in some degree the prejudices of the sect; the love of paradox, the
pertinacious habits of dispute, and a minute attachment to words and
verbal distinctions. The superiority of form to matter was introduced
to ascertain the right of property: and the equality of crimes is
countenanced by an opinion of Trebatius, [57] that he who touches the
ear, touches the whole body; and that he who steals from a heap of corn,
or a hogshead of wine, is guilty of the entire theft. [58]

[Footnote 5311: M. Hugo thinks that the ingenious system of the
Institutes adopted by a great number of the ancient lawyers, and by
Justinian himself, dates from Severus Sulpicius. Hist du Droit Romain,
vol.iii.p. 119.--W.]

[Footnote 54: Crassus, or rather Cicero himself, proposes (de Oratore,
i. 41, 42) an idea of the art or science of jurisprudence, which the
eloquent, but illiterate, Antonius (i. 58) affects to deride. It was
partly executed by Servius Sulpicius, (in Bruto, c. 41,) whose praises
are elegantly varied in the classic Latinity of the Roman Gravina, (p.
60.)]

[Footnote 55: Perturbatricem autem omnium harum rerum academiam, hanc ab
Arcesila et Carneade recentem, exoremus ut sileat, nam si invaserit
in haec, quae satis scite instructa et composita videantur, nimis edet
ruinas, quam quidem ego placare cupio, submovere non audeo. (de Legibus,
i. 13.) From this passage alone, Bentley (Remarks on Free-thinking,
p. 250) might have learned how firmly Cicero believed in the specious
doctrines which he has adorned.]

[Footnote 56: The stoic philosophy was first taught at Rome by
Panaetius, the friend of the younger Scipio, (see his life in the Mem.
de l'Academis des Inscriptions, tom. x. p. 75--89.)]

[Footnote 57: As he is quoted by Ulpian, (leg.40, 40, ad Sabinum in
Pandect. l. xlvii. tit. ii. leg. 21.) Yet Trebatius, after he was a
leading civilian, que qui familiam duxit, became an epicurean, (Cicero
ad Fam. vii. 5.) Perhaps he was not constant or sincere in his new sect.
* Note: Gibbon had entirely misunderstood this phrase of Cicero. It was
only since his time that the real meaning of the author was apprehended.
Cicero, in enumerating the qualifications of Trebatius, says, Accedit
etiam, quod familiam ducit in jure civili, singularis memoria, summa
scientia, which means that Trebatius possessed a still further most
important qualification for a student of civil law, a remarkable memory,
&c. This explanation, already conjectured by G. Menage, Amaenit. Juris
Civilis, c. 14, is found in the dictionary of Scheller, v. Familia, and
in the History of the Roman Law by M. Hugo. Many authors have asserted,
without any proof sufficient to warrant the conjecture, that Trebatius
was of the school of Epicurus--W.]

[Footnote 58: See Gravina (p. 45--51) and the ineffectual cavils
of Mascou. Heineccius (Hist. J. R. No. 125) quotes and approves a
dissertation of Everard Otto, de Stoica Jurisconsultorum Philosophia.]

Arms, eloquence, and the study of the civil law, promoted a citizen to
the honors of the Roman state; and the three professions were
sometimes more conspicuous by their union in the same character. In
the composition of the edict, a learned praetor gave a sanction and
preference to his private sentiments; the opinion of a censor, or a
counsel, was entertained with respect; and a doubtful interpretation of
the laws might be supported by the virtues or triumphs of the civilian.
The patrician arts were long protected by the veil of mystery; and in
more enlightened times, the freedom of inquiry established the general
principles of jurisprudence. Subtile and intricate cases were elucidated
by the disputes of the forum: rules, axioms, and definitions, [59] were
admitted as the genuine dictates of reason; and the consent of the legal
professors was interwoven into the practice of the tribunals. But these
interpreters could neither enact nor execute the laws of the republic;
and the judges might disregard the authority of the Scaevolas
themselves, which was often overthrown by the eloquence or sophistry
of an ingenious pleader. [60] Augustus and Tiberius were the first
to adopt, as a useful engine, the science of the civilians; and their
servile labors accommodated the old system to the spirit and views of
despotism. Under the fair pretence of securing the dignity of the art,
the privilege of subscribing legal and valid opinions was confined to
the sages of senatorian or equestrian rank, who had been previously
approved by the judgment of the prince; and this monopoly prevailed,
till Adrian restored the freedom of the profession to every citizen
conscious of his abilities and knowledge. The discretion of the praetor
was now governed by the lessons of his teachers; the judges were
enjoined to obey the comment as well as the text of the law; and the use
of codicils was a memorable innovation, which Augustus ratified by the
advice of the civilians. [61] [6111]

[Footnote 59: We have heard of the Catonian rule, the Aquilian
stipulation, and the Manilian forms, of 211 maxims, and of 247
definitions, (Pandect. l. i. tit. xvi. xvii.)]

[Footnote 60: Read Cicero, l. i. de Oratore, Topica, pro Murena.]

[Footnote 61: See Pomponius, (de Origine Juris Pandect. l. i. tit. ii.
leg. 2, No 47,) Heineccius, (ad Institut. l. i. tit. ii. No. 8, l. ii.
tit. xxv. in Element et Antiquitat.,) and Gravina, (p. 41--45.) Yet the
monopoly of Augustus, a harsh measure, would appear with some softening
in contemporary evidence; and it was probably veiled by a decree of the
senate]

[Footnote 6111: The author here follows the then generally received
opinion of Heineccius. The proofs which appear to confirm it are l. 2
47, D. I. 2, and 8. Instit. I. 2. The first of these passages speaks
expressly of a privilege granted to certain lawyers, until the time of
Adrian, publice respondendi jus ante Augusti tempora non dabatur. Primus
Divus ut major juris auctoritas haberetur, constituit, ut ex auctoritate
ejus responderent. The passage of the Institutes speaks of the different
opinions of those, quibus est permissum jura condere. It is true that
the first of these passages does not say that the opinion of these
privileged lawyers had the force of a law for the judges. For this
reason M. Hugo altogether rejects the opinion adopted by Heineccius, by
Bach, and in general by all the writers who preceded him. He conceives
that the 8 of the Institutes referred to the constitution of Valentinian
III., which regulated the respective authority to be ascribed to the
different writings of the great civilians. But we have now the following
passage in the Institutes of Gaius: Responsa prudentum sunt sententiae
et opiniones eorum, quibus permissum est jura condere; quorum omnium
si in unum sententiae concorrupt, id quod ita sentiunt, legis vicem
obtinet, si vero dissentiunt, judici licet, quam velit sententiam
sequi, idque rescripto Divi Hadrian signiticatur. I do not know, how in
opposition to this passage, the opinion of M. Hugo can be maintained. We
must add to this the passage quoted from Pomponius and from such strong
proofs, it seems incontestable that the emperors had granted some kind
of privilege to certain civilians, quibus permissum erat jura condere.
Their opinion had sometimes the force of law, legis vicem. M. Hugo,
endeavoring to reconcile this phrase with his system, gives it a forced
interpretation, which quite alters the sense; he supposes that the
passage contains no more than what is evident of itself, that the
authority of the civilians was to be respected, thus making a privilege
of that which was free to all the world. It appears to me almost
indisputable, that the emperors had sanctioned certain provisions
relative to the authority of these civilians, consulted by the judges.
But how far was their advice to be respected? This is a question
which it is impossible to answer precisely, from the want of historic
evidence. Is it not possible that the emperors established an authority
to be consulted by the judges? and in this case this authority must have
emanated from certain civilians named for this purpose by the emperors.
See Hugo, l. c. Moreover, may not the passage of Suetonius, in the Life
of Caligula, where he says that the emperor would no longer permit
the civilians to give their advice, mean that Caligula entertained the
design of suppressing this institution? See on this passage the Themis,
vol. xi. p. 17, 36. Our author not being acquainted with the opinions
opposed to Heineccius has not gone to the bottom of the subject.--W.]

The most absolute mandate could only require that the judges should
agree with the civilians, if the civilians agreed among themselves. But
positive institutions are often the result of custom and prejudice; laws
and language are ambiguous and arbitrary; where reason is incapable of
pronouncing, the love of argument is inflamed by the envy of rivals,
the vanity of masters, the blind attachment of their disciples; and
the Roman jurisprudence was divided by the once famous sects of the
Proculians and Sabinians. [62] Two sages of the law, Ateius Capito and
Antistius Labeo, [63] adorned the peace of the Augustan age; the former
distinguished by the favor of his sovereign; the latter more illustrious
by his contempt of that favor, and his stern though harmless opposition
to the tyrant of Rome. Their legal studies were influenced by the
various colors of their temper and principles. Labeo was attached to
the form of the old republic; his rival embraced the more profitable
substance of the rising monarchy. But the disposition of a courtier
is tame and submissive; and Capito seldom presumed to deviate from the
sentiments, or at least from the words, of his predecessors; while the
bold republican pursued his independent ideas without fear of paradox or
innovations. The freedom of Labeo was enslaved, however, by the rigor of
his own conclusions, and he decided, according to the letter of the
law, the same questions which his indulgent competitor resolved with
a latitude of equity more suitable to the common sense and feelings
of mankind. If a fair exchange had been substituted to the payment of
money, Capito still considered the transaction as a legal sale; [64]
and he consulted nature for the age of puberty, without confining his
definition to the precise period of twelve or fourteen years. [65] This
opposition of sentiments was propagated in the writings and lessons
of the two founders; the schools of Capito and Labeo maintained their
inveterate conflict from the age of Augustus to that of Adrian; [66]
and the two sects derived their appellations from Sabinus and Proculus,
their most celebrated teachers. The names of Cassians and Pegasians were
likewise applied to the same parties; but, by a strange reverse,
the popular cause was in the hands of Pegasus, [67] a timid slave of
Domitian, while the favorite of the Caesars was represented by Cassius,
[68] who gloried in his descent from the patriot assassin. By the
perpetual edict, the controversies of the sects were in a great measure
determined. For that important work, the emperor Adrian preferred the
chief of the Sabinians: the friends of monarchy prevailed; but the
moderation of Salvius Julian insensibly reconciled the victors and the
vanquished. Like the contemporary philosophers, the lawyers of the age
of the Antonines disclaimed the authority of a master, and adopted from
every system the most probable doctrines. [69] But their writings would
have been less voluminous, had their choice been more unanimous. The
conscience of the judge was perplexed by the number and weight of
discordant testimonies, and every sentence that his passion or interest
might pronounce was justified by the sanction of some venerable name. An
indulgent edict of the younger Theodosius excused him from the labor of
comparing and weighing their arguments. Five civilians, Caius, Papinian,
Paul, Ulpian, and Modestinus, were established as the oracles of
jurisprudence: a majority was decisive: but if their opinions were
equally divided, a casting vote was ascribed to the superior wisdom of
Papinian. [70]

[Footnote 62: I have perused the Diatribe of Gotfridus Mascovius, the
learned Mascou, de Sectis Jurisconsultorum, (Lipsiae, 1728, in 12mo., p.
276,) a learned treatise on a narrow and barren ground.]

[Footnote 63: See the character of Antistius Labeo in Tacitus, (Annal.
iii. 75,) and in an epistle of Ateius Capito, (Aul. Gellius, xiii. 12,)
who accuses his rival of libertas nimia et vecors. Yet Horace would not
have lashed a virtuous and respectable senator; and I must adopt the
emendation of Bentley, who reads Labieno insanior, (Serm. I. iii. 82.)
See Mascou, de Sectis, (c. i. p. 1--24.)]

[Footnote 64: Justinian (Institut. l. iii. tit. 23, and Theophil. Vers.
Graec. p. 677, 680) has commemorated this weighty dispute, and the
verses of Homer that were alleged on either side as legal authorities.
It was decided by Paul, (leg. 33, ad Edict. in Pandect. l. xviii.
tit. i. leg. 1,) since, in a simple exchange, the buyer could not be
discriminated from the seller.]

[Footnote 65: This controversy was likewise given for the Proculians, to
supersede the indecency of a search, and to comply with the aphorism of
Hippocrates, who was attached to the septenary number of two weeks of
years, or 700 of days, (Institut. l. i. tit. xxii.) Plutarch and the
Stoics (de Placit. Philosoph. l. v. c. 24) assign a more natural reason.
Fourteen years is the age. See the vestigia of the sects in Mascou, c.
ix. p. 145--276.]

[Footnote 66: The series and conclusion of the sects are described by
Mascou, (c. ii.--vii. p. 24--120;) and it would be almost ridiculous to
praise his equal justice to these obsolete sects. * Note: The work
of Gaius, subsequent to the time of Adrian, furnishes us with some
information on this subject. The disputes which rose between these two
sects appear to have been very numerous. Gaius avows himself a disciple
of Sabinus and of Caius. Compare Hugo, vol. ii. p. 106.--W.]

[Footnote 67: At the first summons he flies to the turbot-council;
yet Juvenal (Satir. iv. 75--81) styles the praefect or bailiff of Rome
sanctissimus legum interpres. From his science, says the old scholiast,
he was called, not a man, but a book. He derived the singular name of
Pegasus from the galley which his father commanded.]

[Footnote 69: Mascou, de Sectis, c. viii. p. 120--144 de Herciscundis,
a legal term which was applied to these eclectic lawyers: herciscere is
synonymous to dividere. * Note: This word has never existed. Cujacius
is the author of it, who read me words terris condi in Servius ad Virg.
herciscundi, to which he gave an erroneous interpretation.--W.]

[Footnote 70: See the Theodosian Code, l. i. tit. iv. with Godefroy's
Commentary, tom. i. p. 30--35. [! This decree might give occasion to
Jesuitical disputes like those in the Lettres Provinciales, whether a
Judge was obliged to follow the opinion of Papinian, or of a majority,
against his judgment, against his conscience, &c. Yet a legislator might
give that opinion, however false, the validity, not of truth, but of
law. Note: We possess (since 1824) some interesting information as to
the framing of the Theodosian Code, and its ratification at Rome, in the
year 438. M. Closius, now professor at Dorpat in Russia, and M. Peyron,
member of the Academy of Turin, have discovered, the one at Milan, the
other at Turin, a great part of the five first books of the Code which
were wanting, and besides this, the reports (gesta) of the sitting of
the senate at Rome, in which the Code was published, in the year
after the marriage of Valentinian III. Among these pieces are the
constitutions which nominate commissioners for the formation of the
Code; and though there are many points of considerable obscurity
in these documents, they communicate many facts relative to this
legislation. 1. That Theodosius designed a great reform in the
legislation; to add to the Gregorian and Hermogenian codes all the new
constitutions from Constantine to his own day; and to frame a second
code for common use with extracts from the three codes, and from the
works of the civil lawyers. All laws either abrogated or fallen into
disuse were to be noted under their proper heads. 2. An Ordinance was
issued in 429 to form a commission for this purpose of nine persons,
of which Antiochus, as quaestor and praefectus, was president. A
second commission of sixteen members was issued in 435 under the
same president. 3. A code, which we possess under the name of Codex
Theodosianus, was finished in 438, published in the East, in an
ordinance addressed to the Praetorian praefect, Florentinus, and
intended to be published in the West. 4. Before it was published in the
West, Valentinian submitted it to the senate. There is a report of
the proceedings of the senate, which closed with loud acclamations and
gratulations.--From Warnkonig, Histoire du Droit Romain, p. 169-Wenck

1825.--M.] * Note *: Closius of Tubingen communicated to M.Warnkonig
the two following constitutions of the emperor Constantine, which he
discovered in the Ambrosian library at Milan:-- 1. Imper. Constantinus
Aug. ad Maximium Praef. Praetorio. Perpetuas prudentum contentiones
eruere cupientes, Ulpiani ac Pauli, in Papinianum notas, qui dum ingenii
laudem sectantur, non tam corrigere eum quam depravere maluerunt,
aboleri praecepimus. Dat. III. Kalend. Octob. Const. Cons. et Crispi,
(321.) Idem. Aug. ad Maximium Praef Praet. Universa, quae scriptura
Pauli continentur, recepta auctoritate firmanda runt, et omni
veneratione celebranda. Ideoque sententiarum libros plepissima luce
et perfectissima elocutione et justissima juris ratione succinctos in
judiciis prolatos valere minimie dubitatur. Dat. V. Kalend. Oct. Trovia
Coust. et Max. Coss. (327.)--W]
