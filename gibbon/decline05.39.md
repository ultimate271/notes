## Chapter LVI: The Saracens, The Franks And The Normans.--Part IV.

Of the Latin princes, the allies of Alexius and enemies of Robert, the
most prompt and powerful was Henry the Third or Fourth, king of Germany
and Italy, and future emperor of the West. The epistle of the Greek
monarch [81] to his brother is filled with the warmest professions of
friendship, and the most lively desire of strengthening their alliance
by every public and private tie. He congratulates Henry on his success
in a just and pious war; and complains that the prosperity of his own
empire is disturbed by the audacious enterprises of the Norman Robert.
The lists of his presents expresses the manners of the age--a radiated
crown of gold, a cross set with pearls to hang on the breast, a case of
relics, with the names and titles of the saints, a vase of crystal, a
vase of sardonyx, some balm, most probably of Mecca, and one hundred
pieces of purple. To these he added a more solid present, of one hundred
and forty-four thousand Byzantines of gold, with a further assurance of
two hundred and sixteen thousand, so soon as Henry should have entered
in arms the Apulian territories, and confirmed by an oath the league
against the common enemy. The German, [82] who was already in Lombardy
at the head of an army and a faction, accepted these liberal offers,
and marched towards the south: his speed was checked by the sound of the
battle of Durazzo; but the influence of his arms, or name, in the hasty
return of Robert, was a full equivalent for the Grecian bribe. Henry was
the severe adversary of the Normans, the allies and vassals of Gregory
the Seventh, his implacable foe. The long quarrel of the throne and
mitre had been recently kindled by the zeal and ambition of that haughty
priest: [83] the king and the pope had degraded each other; and each had
seated a rival on the temporal or spiritual throne of his antagonist.
After the defeat and death of his Swabian rebel, Henry descended into
Italy, to assume the Imperial crown, and to drive from the Vatican the
tyrant of the church. [84] But the Roman people adhered to the cause
of Gregory: their resolution was fortified by supplies of men and money
from Apulia; and the city was thrice ineffectually besieged by the
king of Germany. In the fourth year he corrupted, as it is said, with
Byzantine gold, the nobles of Rome, whose estates and castles had been
ruined by the war. The gates, the bridges, and fifty hostages, were
delivered into his hands: the anti-pope, Clement the Third, was
consecrated in the Lateran: the grateful pontiff crowned his protector
in the Vatican; and the emperor Henry fixed his residence in the
Capitol, as the lawful successor of Augustus and Charlemagne. The ruins
of the Septizonium were still defended by the nephew of Gregory: the
pope himself was invested in the castle of St. Angelo; and his last hope
was in the courage and fidelity of his Norman vassal. Their friendship
had been interrupted by some reciprocal injuries and complaints; but,
on this pressing occasion, Guiscard was urged by the obligation of his
oath, by his interest, more potent than oaths, by the love of fame, and
his enmity to the two emperors. Unfurling the holy banner, he resolved
to fly to the relief of the prince of the apostles: the most numerous of
his armies, six thousand horse, and thirty thousand foot, was instantly
assembled; and his march from Salerno to Rome was animated by the public
applause and the promise of the divine favor. Henry, invincible
in sixty-six battles, trembled at his approach; recollected some
indispensable affairs that required his presence in Lombardy; exhorted
the Romans to persevere in their allegiance; and hastily retreated three
days before the entrance of the Normans. In less than three years, the
son of Tancred of Hauteville enjoyed the glory of delivering the pope,
and of compelling the two emperors, of the East and West, to fly before
his victorious arms. [85] But the triumph of Robert was clouded by the
calamities of Rome. By the aid of the friends of Gregory, the walls had
been perforated or scaled; but the Imperial faction was still powerful
and active; on the third day, the people rose in a furious tumult; and
a hasty word of the conqueror, in his defence or revenge, was the signal
of fire and pillage. [86] The Saracens of Sicily, the subjects of Roger,
and auxiliaries of his brother, embraced this fair occasion of rifling
and profaning the holy city of the Christians: many thousands of the
citizens, in the sight, and by the allies, of their spiritual father
were exposed to violation, captivity, or death; and a spacious quarter
of the city, from the Lateran to the Coliseum, was consumed by the
flames, and devoted to perpetual solitude. [87] From a city, where he
was now hated, and might be no longer feared, Gregory retired to end
his days in the palace of Salerno. The artful pontiff might flatter the
vanity of Guiscard with the hope of a Roman or Imperial crown; but this
dangerous measure, which would have inflamed the ambition of the Norman,
must forever have alienated the most faithful princes of Germany.

[Footnote 81: The epistle itself (Alexias, l. iii. p. 93, 94, 95) well
deserves to be read. There is one expression which Ducange does not
understand. I have endeavored to grope out a tolerable meaning: The
first word is a golden crown; the second is explained by Simon Portius,
(in Lexico Graeco-Barbar.,) by a flash of lightning.]

[Footnote 82: For these general events I must refer to the general
historians Sigonius, Baronius, Muratori, Mosheim, St. Marc, &c.]

[Footnote 83: The lives of Gregory VII. are either legends or
invectives, (St. Marc, Abrege, tom. iii. p. 235, &c.;) and his
miraculous or magical performances are alike incredible to a modern
reader. He will, as usual, find some instruction in Le Clerc, (Vie
de Hildebrand, Bibliot, ancienne et moderne, tom. viii.,) and much
amusement in Bayle, (Dictionnaire Critique, Gregoire VII.) That pope was
undoubtedly a great man, a second Athanasius, in a more fortunate age of
the church. May I presume to add, that the portrait of Athanasius is one
of the passages of my history (vol. ii. p. 332, &c.) with which I am
the least dissatisfied? * Note: There is a fair life of Gregory VII.
by Voigt, (Weimar. 1815,) which has been translated into French. M.
Villemain, it is understood, has devoted much time to the study of this
remarkable character, to whom his eloquence may do justice. There
is much valuable information on the subject in the accurate work of
Stenzel, Geschichte Deutschlands unter den Frankischen Kaisern--the
History of Germany under the Emperors of the Franconian Race.--M.]

[Footnote 84: Anna, with the rancor of a Greek schismatic, calls him (l.
i. p. 32,) a pope, or priest, worthy to be spit upon and accuses him of
scourging, shaving, and perhaps of castrating the ambassadors of Henry,
(p. 31, 33.) But this outrage is improbable and doubtful, (see the
sensible preface of Cousin.)]

[Footnote 85:

     Sic uno tempore victi

     Sunt terrae Domini duo: rex Alemannicus iste,

         Imperii rector Romani maximus ille.

     Alter ad arma ruens armis superatur; et alter

         Nominis auditi sola formidine cessit.

It is singular enough, that the Apulian, a Latin, should distinguish the
Greek as the ruler of the Roman empire, (l. iv. p. 274.)]

[Footnote 86: The narrative of Malaterra (l. iii. c. 37, p. 587, 588) is
authentic, circumstantial, and fair. Dux ignem exclamans urbe incensa,
&c. The Apulian softens the mischief, (inde quibusdam aedibus exustis,)
which is again exaggerated in some partial chronicles, (Muratori,
Annali, tom. ix. p. 147.)]

[Footnote 87: After mentioning this devastation, the Jesuit Donatus
(de Roma veteri et nova, l. iv. c. 8, p. 489) prettily adds, Duraret
hodieque in Coelio monte, interque ipsum et capitolium, miserabilis
facies prostrates urbis, nisi in hortorum vinetorumque amoenitatem
Roma resurrexisset, ut perpetua viriditate contegeret vulnera et ruinas
suas.]

The deliverer and scourge of Rome might have indulged himself in a
season of repose; but in the same year of the flight of the German
emperor, the indefatigable Robert resumed the design of his eastern
conquests. The zeal or gratitude of Gregory had promised to his valor
the kingdoms of Greece and Asia; [88] his troops were assembled in
arms, flushed with success, and eager for action. Their numbers, in the
language of Homer, are compared by Anna to a swarm of bees; [89] yet the
utmost and moderate limits of the powers of Guiscard have been already
defined; they were contained on this second occasion in one hundred
and twenty vessels; and as the season was far advanced, the harbor of
Brundusium [90] was preferred to the open road of Otranto. Alexius,
apprehensive of a second attack, had assiduously labored to restore the
naval forces of the empire; and obtained from the republic of Venice an
important succor of thirty-six transports, fourteen galleys, and
nine galiots or ships of extra-ordinary strength and magnitude. Their
services were liberally paid by the license or monopoly of trade, a
profitable gift of many shops and houses in the port of Constantinople,
and a tribute to St. Mark, the more acceptable, as it was the produce
of a tax on their rivals at Amalphi. By the union of the Greeks and
Venetians, the Adriatic was covered with a hostile fleet; but their
own neglect, or the vigilance of Robert, the change of a wind, or the
shelter of a mist, opened a free passage; and the Norman troops were
safely disembarked on the coast of Epirus. With twenty strong and
well-appointed galleys, their intrepid duke immediately sought the
enemy, and though more accustomed to fight on horseback, he trusted his
own life, and the lives of his brother and two sons, to the event of a
naval combat. The dominion of the sea was disputed in three engagements,
in sight of the Isle of Corfu: in the two former, the skill and numbers
of the allies were superior; but in the third, the Normans obtained a
final and complete victory. [91] The light brigantines of the Greeks
were scattered in ignominious flight: the nine castles of the Venetians
maintained a more obstinate conflict; seven were sunk, two were taken;
two thousand five hundred captives implored in vain the mercy of the
victor; and the daughter of Alexius deplores the loss of thirteen
thousand of his subjects or allies. The want of experience had been
supplied by the genius of Guiscard; and each evening, when he had
sounded a retreat, he calmly explored the causes of his repulse, and
invented new methods how to remedy his own defects, and to baffle the
advantages of the enemy. The winter season suspended his progress: with
the return of spring he again aspired to the conquest of Constantinople;
but, instead of traversing the hills of Epirus, he turned his arms
against Greece and the islands, where the spoils would repay the labor,
and where the land and sea forces might pursue their joint operations
with vigor and effect. But, in the Isle of Cephalonia, his projects
were fatally blasted by an epidemical disease: Robert himself, in the
seventieth year of his age, expired in his tent; and a suspicion of
poison was imputed, by public rumor, to his wife, or to the Greek
emperor. [92] This premature death might allow a boundless scope for the
imagination of his future exploits; and the event sufficiently declares,
that the Norman greatness was founded on his life. [93] Without the
appearance of an enemy, a victorious army dispersed or retreated in
disorder and consternation; and Alexius, who had trembled for his
empire, rejoiced in his deliverance. The galley which transported the
remains of Guiscard was ship-wrecked on the Italian shore; but the
duke's body was recovered from the sea, and deposited in the sepulchre
of Venusia, [94] a place more illustrious for the birth of Horace [95]
than for the burial of the Norman heroes. Roger, his second son and
successor, immediately sunk to the humble station of a duke of Apulia:
the esteem or partiality of his father left the valiant Bohemond to the
inheritance of his sword.

The national tranquillity was disturbed by his claims, till the first
crusade against the infidels of the East opened a more splendid field of
glory and conquest. [96]

[Footnote 88: The royalty of Robert, either promised or bestowed by the
pope, (Anna, l. i. p. 32,) is sufficiently confirmed by the Apulian, (l.
iv. p. 270.) --Romani regni sibi promisisse coronam Papa ferebatur.
Nor can I understand why Gretser, and the other papal advocates, should
be displeased with this new instance of apostolic jurisdiction.]

[Footnote 89: See Homer, Iliad, B. (I hate this pedantic mode of
quotation by letters of the Greek alphabet) 87, &c. His bees are the
image of a disorderly crowd: their discipline and public works seem to
be the ideas of a later age, (Virgil. Aeneid. l. i.)]

[Footnote 90: Gulielm. Appulus, l. v. p. 276.) The admirable port of
Brundusium was double; the outward harbor was a gulf covered by an
island, and narrowing by degrees, till it communicated by a small gullet
with the inner harbor, which embraced the city on both sides. Caesar and
nature have labored for its ruin; and against such agents what are the
feeble efforts of the Neapolitan government? (Swinburne's Travels in the
Two Sicilies, vol. i. p. 384-390.]

[Footnote 91: William of Apulia (l. v. p. 276) describes the victory of
the Normans, and forgets the two previous defeats, which are diligently
recorded by Anna Comnena, (l. vi. p. 159, 160, 161.) In her turn, she
invents or magnifies a fourth action, to give the Venetians revenge and
rewards. Their own feelings were far different, since they deposed their
doge, propter excidium stoli, (Dandulus in Chron in Muratori, Script.
Rerum Italicarum, tom. xii. p. 249.)]

[Footnote 92: The most authentic writers, William of Apulia. (l.
v. 277,) Jeffrey Malaterra, (l. iii. c. 41, p. 589,) and Romuald of
Salerno, (Chron. in Muratori, Script. Rerum Ital. tom. vii.,) are
ignorant of this crime, so apparent to our countrymen William of
Malmsbury (l. iii. p. 107) and Roger de Hoveden, (p. 710, in Script.
post Bedam) and the latter can tell, how the just Alexius married,
crowned, and burnt alive, his female accomplice. The English historian
is indeed so blind, that he ranks Robert Guiscard, or Wiscard, among the
knights of Henry I, who ascended the throne fifteen years after the duke
of Apulia's death.]

[Footnote 93: The joyful Anna Comnena scatters some flowers over the
grave of an enemy, (Alexiad, l. v. p. 162-166;) and his best praise
is the esteem and envy of William the Conqueror, the sovereign of his
family Graecia (says Malaterra) hostibus recedentibus libera laeta
quievit: Apulia tota sive Calabria turbatur.]

[Footnote 94: Urbs Venusina nitet tantis decorata sepulchris, is one
of the last lines of the Apulian's poems, (l. v. p. 278.) William of
Malmsbury (l. iii. p. 107) inserts an epitaph on Guiscard, which is not
worth transcribing.]

[Footnote 95: Yet Horace had few obligations to Venusia; he was carried
to Rome in his childhood, (Serm. i. 6;) and his repeated allusions to
the doubtful limit of Apulia and Lucania (Carm. iii. 4, Serm. ii. I) are
unworthy of his age and genius.]

[Footnote 96: See Giannone (tom. ii. p. 88-93) and the historians of
the fire crusade.]

Of human life, the most glorious or humble prospects are alike and
soon bounded by the sepulchre. The male line of Robert Guiscard was
extinguished, both in Apulia and at Antioch, in the second generation;
but his younger brother became the father of a line of kings; and the
son of the great count was endowed with the name, the conquests, and the
spirit, of the first Roger. [97] The heir of that Norman adventurer was
born in Sicily; and, at the age of only four years, he succeeded to
the sovereignty of the island, a lot which reason might envy, could she
indulge for a moment the visionary, though virtuous wish of dominion.
Had Roger been content with his fruitful patrimony, a happy and grateful
people might have blessed their benefactor; and if a wise administration
could have restored the prosperous times of the Greek colonies, [98] the
opulence and power of Sicily alone might have equalled the widest
scope that could be acquired and desolated by the sword of war. But the
ambition of the great count was ignorant of these noble pursuits; it
was gratified by the vulgar means of violence and artifice. He sought to
obtain the undivided possession of Palermo, of which one moiety had been
ceded to the elder branch; struggled to enlarge his Calabrian limits
beyond the measure of former treaties; and impatiently watched the
declining health of his cousin William of Apulia, the grandson of
Robert. On the first intelligence of his premature death, Roger sailed
from Palermo with seven galleys, cast anchor in the Bay of Salerno,
received, after ten days' negotiation, an oath of fidelity from the
Norman capital, commanded the submission of the barons, and extorted a
legal investiture from the reluctant popes, who could not long endure
either the friendship or enmity of a powerful vassal. The sacred spot
of Benevento was respectfully spared, as the patrimony of St. Peter;
but the reduction of Capua and Naples completed the design of his uncle
Guiscard; and the sole inheritance of the Norman conquests was possessed
by the victorious Roger. A conscious superiority of power and merit
prompted him to disdain the titles of duke and of count; and the Isle of
Sicily, with a third perhaps of the continent of Italy, might form the
basis of a kingdom [99] which would only yield to the monarchies of
France and England. The chiefs of the nation who attended his coronation
at Palermo might doubtless pronounce under what name he should reign
over them; but the example of a Greek tyrant or a Saracen emir was
insufficient to justify his regal character; and the nine kings of the
Latin world [100] might disclaim their new associate, unless he were
consecrated by the authority of the supreme pontiff. The pride of
Anacletus was pleased to confer a title, which the pride of the Norman
had stooped to solicit; [101] but his own legitimacy was attacked by the
adverse election of Innocent the Second; and while Anacletus sat in
the Vatican, the successful fugitive was acknowledged by the nations of
Europe. The infant monarchy of Roger was shaken, and almost overthrown,
by the unlucky choice of an ecclesiastical patron; and the sword of
Lothaire the Second of Germany, the excommunications of Innocent, the
fleets of Pisa, and the zeal of St. Bernard, were united for the ruin of
the Sicilian robber. After a gallant resistance, the Norman prince was
driven from the continent of Italy: a new duke of Apulia was invested by
the pope and the emperor, each of whom held one end of the gonfanon,
or flagstaff, as a token that they asserted their right, and suspended
their quarrel. But such jealous friendship was of short and precarious
duration: the German armies soon vanished in disease and desertion:
[102] the Apulian duke, with all his adherents, was exterminated by a
conqueror who seldom forgave either the dead or the living; like his
predecessor Leo the Ninth, the feeble though haughty pontiff became
the captive and friend of the Normans; and their reconciliation was
celebrated by the eloquence of Bernard, who now revered the title and
virtues of the king of Sicily.

[Footnote 97: The reign of Roger, and the Norman kings of Sicily,
fills books of the Istoria Civile of Giannone, (tom. ii. l. xi.-xiv. p.
136-340,) and is spread over the ixth and xth volumes of the Italian
Annals of Muratori. In the Bibliotheque Italique (tom. i. p. 175-122,)
I find a useful abstract of Capacelatro, a modern Neapolitan, who has
composed, in two volumes, the history of his country from Roger Frederic
II. inclusive.]

tyrant Dionysius of Syracuse could maintain a standing force of 10,000
horse, 100,000 foot, and 400 galleys. Compare Hume, (Essays, vol. i. p.
268, 435,) and his adversary Wallace, (Numbers of Mankind, p. 306, 307.)

Reidesel, Swinburne, &c.]

[Footnote 99: A contemporary historian of the acts of Roger from the
year 1127 to 1135, founds his title on merit and power, the consent
of the barons, and the ancient royalty of Sicily and Palermo, without
introducing Pope Anacletus, (Alexand. Coenobii Telesini Abbatis de Rebus
gestis Regis Rogerii, lib. iv. in Muratori, Script. Rerum Ital. tom. v.
p. 607-645)]

[Footnote 100: The kings of France, England, Scotland, Castille,
Arragon, Navarre, Sweden, Denmark, and Hungary. The three first were
more ancient than Charlemagne; the three next were created by their
sword; the three last by their baptism; and of these the king of Hungary
alone was honored or debased by a papal crown.]

[Footnote 101: Fazellus, and a crowd of Sicilians, had imagined a more
early and independent coronation, (A.D. 1130, May 1,) which Giannone
unwillingly rejects, (tom. ii. p. 137-144.) This fiction is disproved
by the silence of contemporaries; nor can it be restored by a spurious
character of Messina, (Muratori, Annali d' Italia, tom. ix. p. 340.
Pagi, Critica, tom. iv. p. 467, 468.)]

[Footnote 102: Roger corrupted the second person of Lothaire's army, who
sounded, or rather cried, a retreat; for the Germans (says Cinnamus,
l. iii. c. i. p. 51) are ignorant of the use of trumpets. Most ignorant
himself! * Note: Cinnamus says nothing of their ignorance.--M]

As a penance for his impious war against the successor of St. Peter,
that monarch might have promised to display the banner of the cross,
and he accomplished with ardor a vow so propitious to his interest and
revenge. The recent injuries of Sicily might provoke a just retaliation
on the heads of the Saracens: the Normans, whose blood had been mingled
with so many subject streams, were encouraged to remember and emulate
the naval trophies of their fathers, and in the maturity of their
strength they contended with the decline of an African power. When the
Fatimite caliph departed for the conquest of Egypt, he rewarded the real
merit and apparent fidelity of his servant Joseph with a gift of his
royal mantle, and forty Arabian horses, his palace with its sumptuous
furniture, and the government of the kingdoms of Tunis and Algiers. The
Zeirides, [103] the descendants of Joseph, forgot their allegiance and
gratitude to a distant benefactor, grasped and abused the fruits of
prosperity; and after running the little course of an Oriental dynasty,
were now fainting in their own weakness. On the side of the land, they
were pressed by the Almohades, the fanatic princes of Morocco, while
the sea-coast was open to the enterprises of the Greeks and Franks, who,
before the close of the eleventh century, had extorted a ransom of two
hundred thousand pieces of gold. By the first arms of Roger, the island
or rock of Malta, which has been since ennobled by a military and
religious colony, was inseparably annexed to the crown of Sicily.
Tripoli, [104] a strong and maritime city, was the next object of his
attack; and the slaughter of the males, the captivity of the females,
might be justified by the frequent practice of the Moslems themselves.
The capital of the Zeirides was named Africa from the country, and
Mahadia [105] from the Arabian founder: it is strongly built on a neck
of land, but the imperfection of the harbor is not compensated by the
fertility of the adjacent plain. Mahadia was besieged by George the
Sicilian admiral, with a fleet of one hundred and fifty galleys, amply
provided with men and the instruments of mischief: the sovereign had
fled, the Moorish governor refused to capitulate, declined the last and
irresistible assault, and secretly escaping with the Moslem inhabitants
abandoned the place and its treasures to the rapacious Franks. In
successive expeditions, the king of Sicily or his lieutenants reduced
the cities of Tunis, Safax, Capsia, Bona, and a long tract of the
sea-coast; [106] the fortresses were garrisoned, the country was
tributary, and a boast that it held Africa in subjection might be
inscribed with some flattery on the sword of Roger. [107] After his
death, that sword was broken; and these transmarine possessions
were neglected, evacuated, or lost, under the troubled reign of his
successor. [108] The triumphs of Scipio and Belisarius have proved, that
the African continent is neither inaccessible nor invincible; yet the
great princes and powers of Christendom have repeatedly failed in their
armaments against the Moors, who may still glory in the easy conquest
and long servitude of Spain.

Since the decease of Robert Guiscard, the Normans had relinquished,
above sixty years, their hostile designs against the empire of the East.
The policy of Roger solicited a public and private union with the Greek
princes, whose alliance would dignify his regal character: he demanded
in marriage a daughter of the Comnenian family, and the first steps of
the treaty seemed to promise a favorable event. But the contemptuous
treatment of his ambassadors exasperated the vanity of the new monarch;
and the insolence of the Byzantine court was expiated, according to the
laws of nations, by the sufferings of a guiltless people. [109] With the
fleet of seventy galleys, George, the admiral of Sicily, appeared before
Corfu; and both the island and city were delivered into his hands by the
disaffected inhabitants, who had yet to learn that a siege is still
more calamitous than a tribute. In this invasion, of some moment in the
annals of commerce, the Normans spread themselves by sea, and over
the provinces of Greece; and the venerable age of Athens, Thebes, and
Corinth, was violated by rapine and cruelty. Of the wrongs of Athens,
no memorial remains. The ancient walls, which encompassed, without
guarding, the opulence of Thebes, were scaled by the Latin Christians;
but their sole use of the gospel was to sanctify an oath, that the
lawful owners had not secreted any relic of their inheritance or
industry. On the approach of the Normans, the lower town of Corinth
was evacuated; the Greeks retired to the citadel, which was seated on a
lofty eminence, abundantly watered by the classic fountain of Pirene;
an impregnable fortress, if the want of courage could be balanced by any
advantages of art or nature. As soon as the besiegers had surmounted the
labor (their sole labor) of climbing the hill, their general, from
the commanding eminence, admired his own victory, and testified his
gratitude to Heaven, by tearing from the altar the precious image of
Theodore, the tutelary saint. The silk weavers of both sexes, whom
George transported to Sicily, composed the most valuable part of the
spoil; and in comparing the skilful industry of the mechanic with the
sloth and cowardice of the soldier, he was heard to exclaim that the
distaff and loom were the only weapons which the Greeks were capable of
using. The progress of this naval armament was marked by two conspicuous
events, the rescue of the king of France, and the insult of the
Byzantine capital. In his return by sea from an unfortunate crusade,
Louis the Seventh was intercepted by the Greeks, who basely violated the
laws of honor and religion. The fortunate encounter of the Norman
fleet delivered the royal captive; and after a free and honorable
entertainment in the court of Sicily, Louis continued his journey to
Rome and Paris. [110] In the absence of the emperor, Constantinople and
the Hellespont were left without defence and without the suspicion
of danger. The clergy and people (for the soldiers had followed
the standard of Manuel) were astonished and dismayed at the hostile
appearance of a line of galleys, which boldly cast anchor in the front
of the Imperial city. The forces of the Sicilian admiral were inadequate
to the siege or assault of an immense and populous metropolis; but
George enjoyed the glory of humbling the Greek arrogance, and of marking
the path of conquest to the navies of the West. He landed some soldiers
to rifle the fruits of the royal gardens, and pointed with silver, or
most probably with fire, the arrows which he discharged against the
palace of the Caesars. [111] This playful outrage of the pirates of
Sicily, who had surprised an unguarded moment, Manuel affected to
despise, while his martial spirit, and the forces of the empire, were
awakened to revenge. The Archipelago and Ionian Sea were covered with
his squadrons and those of Venice; but I know not by what favorable
allowance of transports, victuallers, and pinnaces, our reason, or
even our fancy, can be reconciled to the stupendous account of fifteen
hundred vessels, which is proposed by a Byzantine historian. These
operations were directed with prudence and energy: in his homeward
voyage George lost nineteen of his galleys, which were separated and
taken: after an obstinate defence, Corfu implored the clemency of her
lawful sovereign; nor could a ship, a soldier, of the Norman prince, be
found, unless as a captive, within the limits of the Eastern empire. The
prosperity and the health of Roger were already in a declining state:
while he listened in his palace of Palermo to the messengers of victory
or defeat, the invincible Manuel, the foremost in every assault, was
celebrated by the Greeks and Latins as the Alexander or the Hercules of
the age.

[Footnote 109: The silence of the Sicilian historians, who end too soon,
or begin too late, must be supplied by Otho of Frisingen, a German, (de
Gestis Frederici I. l. i. c. 33, in Muratori, Script. tom. vi. p. 668,)
the Venetian Andrew Dandulus, (Id. tom. xii. p. 282, 283) and the Greek
writers Cinnamus (l. iii. c. 2-5) and Nicetas, (in Manuel. l. iii. c.
1-6.)]

[Footnote 110: To this imperfect capture and speedy rescue I apply
Cinnamus, l. ii. c. 19, p. 49. Muratori, on tolerable evidence, (Annali
d'Italia, tom. ix. p. 420, 421,) laughs at the delicacy of the French,
who maintain, marisque nullo impediente periculo ad regnum proprium
reversum esse; yet I observe that their advocate, Ducange, is less
positive as the commentator on Cinnamus, than as the editor of
Joinville.]

[Footnote 111: In palatium regium sagittas igneas injecit, says
Dandulus; but Nicetas (l. ii. c. 8, p. 66) transforms them, and adds,
that Manuel styled this insult. These arrows, by the compiler, Vincent
de Beauvais, are again transmuted into gold.]
