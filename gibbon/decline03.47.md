## Chapter XXXVIII: Reign Of Clovis.--Part V.

In a century of perpetual, or at least implacable, war, much courage,
and some skill, must have been exerted for the defence of Britain. Yet
if the memory of its champions is almost buried in oblivion, we need
not repine; since every age, however destitute of science or virtue,
sufficiently abounds with acts of blood and military renown. The tomb
of Vortimer, the son of Vortigern, was erected on the margin of the
sea-shore, as a landmark formidable to the Saxons, whom he had thrice
vanquished in the fields of Kent. Ambrosius Aurelian was descended from
a noble family of Romans; [138] his modesty was equal to his valor, and
his valor, till the last fatal action, [139] was crowned with splendid
success. But every British name is effaced by the illustrious name of
Arthur, [140] the hereditary prince of the Silures, in South Wales,
and the elective king or general of the nation. According to the most
rational account, he defeated, in twelve successive battles, the Angles
of the North, and the Saxons of the West; but the declining age of the
hero was imbittered by popular ingratitude and domestic misfortunes. The
events of his life are less interesting than the singular revolutions
of his fame. During a period of five hundred years the tradition of his
exploits was preserved, and rudely embellished, by the obscure bards of
Wales and Armorica, who were odious to the Saxons, and unknown to
the rest of mankind. The pride and curiosity of the Norman conquerors
prompted them to inquire into the ancient history of Britain: they
listened with fond credulity to the tale of Arthur, and eagerly
applauded the merit of a prince who had triumphed over the Saxons, their
common enemies. His romance, transcribed in the Latin of Jeffrey of
Monmouth, and afterwards translated into the fashionable idiom of the
times, was enriched with the various, though incoherent, ornaments which
were familiar to the experience, the learning, or the fancy, of the
twelfth century. The progress of a Phrygian colony, from the Tyber to
the Thames, was easily ingrafted on the fable of the Aeneid; and the
royal ancestors of Arthur derived their origin from Troy, and claimed
their alliance with the Caesars. His trophies were decorated with
captive provinces and Imperial titles; and his Danish victories avenged
the recent injuries of his country. The gallantry and superstition
of the British hero, his feasts and tournaments, and the memorable
institution of his Knights of the Round Table, were faithfully copied
from the reigning manners of chivalry; and the fabulous exploits of
Uther's son appear less incredible than the adventures which were
achieved by the enterprising valor of the Normans. Pilgrimage, and
the holy wars, introduced into Europe the specious miracles of Arabian
magic. Fairies and giants, flying dragons, and enchanted palaces, were
blended with the more simple fictions of the West; and the fate of
Britain depended on the art, or the predictions, of Merlin. Every nation
embraced and adorned the popular romance of Arthur, and the Knights of
the Round Table: their names were celebrated in Greece and Italy; and
the voluminous tales of Sir Lancelot and Sir Tristram were devoutly
studied by the princes and nobles, who disregarded the genuine heroes
and historians of antiquity. At length the light of science and reason
was rekindled; the talisman was broken; the visionary fabric melted into
air; and by a natural, though unjust, reverse of the public opinion,
the severity of the present age is inclined to question the existence of
Arthur. [141]

[Footnote 138: Bede, who in his chronicle (p. 28) places Ambrosius under
the reign of Zeno, (A.D. 474-491,) observes, that his parents had been
"purpura induti;" which he explains, in his ecclesiastical history,
by "regium nomen et insigne ferentibus," (l. i. c. 16, p. 53.) The
expression of Nennius (c. 44, p. 110, edit. Gale) is still more
singular, "Unus de consulibus gentis Romanicae est pater meus."]

[Footnote 139: By the unanimous, though doubtful, conjecture of our
antiquarians, Ambrosius is confounded with Natanleod, who (A.D. 508)
lost his own life, and five thousand of his subjects, in a battle
against Cerdic, the West Saxon, (Chron. Saxon. p. 17, 18.)]

[Footnote 140: As I am a stranger to the Welsh bards, Myrdhin, Llomarch,
and Taliessin, my faith in the existence and exploits of Arthur
principally rests on the simple and circumstantial testimony of Nennius.
(Hist. Brit. c. 62, 63, p. 114.) Mr. Whitaker, (Hist. of Manchester,
vol. ii. p. 31-71) had framed an interesting, and even probable,
narrative of the wars of Arthur: though it is impossible to allow the
reality of the round table. * Note: I presume that Gibbon means Llywarch
Hen, or the Aged.--The Elegies of this Welsh prince and bard have been
published by Mr. Owen; to whose works and in the Myvyrian Archaeology,
slumbers much curious information on the subject of Welsh tradition and
poetry. But the Welsh antiquarians have never obtained a hearing from
the public; they have had no Macpherson to compensate for his corruption
of their poetic legends by forcing them into popularity.--See also Mr.
Sharon Turner's Essay on the Welsh Bards.--M.]

[Footnote 141: The progress of romance, and the state of learning, in
the middle ages, are illustrated by Mr. Thomas Warton, with the taste of
a poet, and the minute diligence of an antiquarian. I have derived much
instruction from the two learned dissertations prefixed to the first
volume of his History of English Poetry. * Note: These valuable
dissertations should not now be read without the notes and preliminary
essay of the late editor, Mr. Price, which, in point of taste and
fulness of information, are worthy of accompanying and completing
those of Warton.--M.] Resistance, if it cannot avert, must increase the
miseries of conquest; and conquest has never appeared more dreadful
and destructive than in the hands of the Saxons; who hated the valor of
their enemies, disdained the faith of treaties, and violated, without
remorse, the most sacred objects of the Christian worship. The fields of
battle might be traced, almost in every district, by monuments of bones;
the fragments of falling towers were stained with blood; the last of the
Britons, without distinction of age or sex, was massacred, [142] in
the ruins of Anderida; [143] and the repetition of such calamities was
frequent and familiar under the Saxon heptarchy. The arts and religion,
the laws and language, which the Romans had so carefully planted in
Britain, were extirpated by their barbarous successors. After the
destruction of the principal churches, the bishops, who had declined
the crown of martyrdom, retired with the holy relics into Wales and
Armorica; the remains of their flocks were left destitute of any
spiritual food; the practice, and even the remembrance, of Christianity
were abolished; and the British clergy might obtain some comfort
from the damnation of the idolatrous strangers. The kings of France
maintained the privileges of their Roman subjects; but the ferocious
Saxons trampled on the laws of Rome, and of the emperors. The
proceedings of civil and criminal jurisdiction, the titles of honor, the
forms of office, the ranks of society, and even the domestic rights of
marriage, testament, and inheritance, were finally suppressed; and the
indiscriminate crowd of noble and plebeian slaves was governed by the
traditionary customs, which had been coarsely framed for the shepherds
and pirates of Germany. The language of science, of business, and of
conversation, which had been introduced by the Romans, was lost in the
general desolation. A sufficient number of Latin or Celtic words might
be assumed by the Germans, to express their new wants and ideas; [144]
but those illiterate Pagans preserved and established the use of their
national dialect. [145] Almost every name, conspicuous either in the
church or state, reveals its Teutonic origin; [146] and the geography
of England was universally inscribed with foreign characters and
appellations. The example of a revolution, so rapid and so complete, may
not easily be found; but it will excite a probable suspicion, that the
arts of Rome were less deeply rooted in Britain than in Gaul or Spain;
and that the native rudeness of the country and its inhabitants was
covered by a thin varnish of Italian manners.

[Footnote 142: Hoc anno (490) Aella et Cissa obsederunt
Andredes-Ceaster; et interfecerunt omnes qui id incoluerunt; adeo ut ne
unus Brito ibi superstes fuerit, (Chron. Saxon. p. 15;) an expression
more dreadful in its simplicity, than all the vague and tedious
lamentations of the British Jeremiah.]

[Footnote 143: Andredes-Ceaster, or Anderida, is placed by Camden
(Britannia, vol. i. p. 258) at Newenden, in the marshy grounds of Kent,
which might be formerly covered by the sea, and on the edge of the great
forest (Anderida) which overspread so large a portion of Hampshire and
Sussex.]

[Footnote 144: Dr. Johnson affirms, that few English words are of
British extraction. Mr. Whitaker, who understands the British language,
has discovered more than three thousand, and actually produces a long
and various catalogue, (vol. ii. p. 235-329.) It is possible, indeed,
that many of these words may have been imported from the Latin or Saxon
into the native idiom of Britain. * Note: Dr. Prichard's very curious
researches, which connect the Celtic, as well as the Teutonic languages
with the Indo-European class, make it still more difficult to decide
between the Celtic or Teutonic origin of English words.--See Prichard on
the Eastern Origin of the Celtic Nations Oxford, 1831.--M.]

[Footnote 145: In the beginning of the seventh century, the Franks and
the Anglo-Saxons mutually understood each other's language, which was
derived from the same Teutonic root, (Bede, l. i. c. 25, p. 60.)]

[Footnote 146: After the first generation of Italian, or Scottish,
missionaries, the dignities of the church were filled with Saxon
proselytes.]

This strange alteration has persuaded historians, and even philosophers,
that the provincials of Britain were totally exterminated; and that
the vacant land was again peopled by the perpetual influx, and rapid
increase, of the German colonies. Three hundred thousand Saxons are said
to have obeyed the summons of Hengist; [147] the entire emigation of the
Angles was attested, in the age of Bede, by the solitude of their native
country; [148] and our experience has shown the free propagation of the
human race, if they are cast on a fruitful wilderness, where their steps
are unconfined, and their subsistence is plentiful. The Saxon kingdoms
displayed the face of recent discovery and cultivation; the towns
were small, the villages were distant; the husbandry was languid and
unskilful; four sheep were equivalent to an acre of the best land; [149]
an ample space of wood and morass was resigned to the vague dominion of
nature; and the modern bishopric of Durham, the whole territory from the
Tyne to the Tees, had returned to its primitive state of a savage
and solitary forest. [150] Such imperfect population might have been
supplied, in some generations, by the English colonies; but neither
reason nor facts can justify the unnatural supposition, that the Saxons
of Britain remained alone in the desert which they had subdued. After
the sanguinary Barbarians had secured their dominion, and gratified
their revenge, it was their interest to preserve the peasants as well as
the cattle, of the unresisting country. In each successive revolution,
the patient herd becomes the property of its new masters; and the
salutary compact of food and labor is silently ratified by their mutual
necessities. Wilfrid, the apostle of Sussex, [151] accepted from his
royal convert the gift of the Vpeninsula of Selsey, near Chichester,
with the persons and property of its inhabitants, who then amounted
to eighty-seven families. He released them at once from spiritual and
temporal bondage; and two hundred and fifty slaves of both sexes were
baptized by their indulgent master. The kingdom of Sussex, which spread
from the sea to the Thames, contained seven thousand families; twelve
hundred were ascribed to the Isle of Wight; and, if we multiply this
vague computation, it may seem probable, that England was cultivated by
a million of servants, or villains, who were attached to the estates of
their arbitrary landlords. The indigent Barbarians were often tempted
to sell their children, or themselves into perpetual, and even foreign,
bondage; [152] yet the special exemptions which were granted to national
slaves, [153] sufficiently declare that they were much less numerous
than the strangers and captives, who had lost their liberty, or changed
their masters, by the accidents of war. When time and religion had
mitigated the fierce spirit of the Anglo-Saxons, the laws encouraged
the frequent practice of manumission; and their subjects, of Welsh
or Cambrian extraction, assumed the respectable station of inferior
freemen, possessed of lands, and entitled to the rights of civil
society. [154] Such gentle treatment might secure the allegiance of a
fierce people, who had been recently subdued on the confines of Wales
and Cornwall. The sage Ina, the legislator of Wessex, united the two
nations in the bands of domestic alliance; and four British lords of
Somersetshire may be honorably distinguished in the court of a Saxon
monarch. [155]

[Footnote 147: Carte's History of England, vol. i. p. 195. He quotes the
British historians; but I much fear, that Jeffrey of Monmouth (l. vi. c.
15) is his only witness.]

[Footnote 148: Bede, Hist. Ecclesiast. l. i. c. 15, p. 52. The fact is
probable, and well attested: yet such was the loose intermixture of
the German tribes, that we find, in a subsequent period, the law of the
Angli and Warini of Germany, (Lindenbrog. Codex, p. 479-486.)]

[Footnote 149: See Dr. Henry's useful and laborious History of Great
Britain, vol. ii. p. 388.]

[Footnote 150: Quicquid (says John of Tinemouth) inter Tynam et Tesam
fluvios extitit, sola eremi vastitudo tunc temporis fuit, et idcirco
nullius ditioni servivit, eo quod sola indomitorum et sylvestrium
animalium spelunca et habitatio fuit, (apud Carte, vol. i. p. 195.) From
bishop Nicholson (English Historical Library, p. 65, 98) I understand
that fair copies of John of Tinemouth's ample collections are preserved
in the libraries of Oxford, Lambeth, &c.]

[Footnote 151: See the mission of Wilfrid, &c., in Bede, Hist. Eccles.
l. iv. c. 13, 16, p. 155, 156, 159.]

[Footnote 152: From the concurrent testimony of Bede (l. ii. c. 1, p.
78) and William of Malmsbury, (l. iii. p. 102,) it appears, that
the Anglo-Saxons, from the first to the last age, persisted in this
unnatural practice. Their youths were publicly sold in the market of
Rome.]

[Footnote 153: According to the laws of Ina, they could not be lawfully
sold beyond the seas.]

[Footnote 154: The life of a Wallus, or Cambricus, homo, who possessed a
hyde of land, is fixed at 120 shillings, by the same laws (of Ina, tit.
xxxii. in Leg. Anglo-Saxon. p. 20) which allowed 200 shillings for a
free Saxon, 1200 for a Thane, (see likewise Leg. Anglo-Saxon. p. 71.)
We may observe, that these legislators, the West Saxons and Mercians,
continued their British conquests after they became Christians. The laws
of the four kings of Kent do not condescend to notice the existence of
any subject Britons.]

[Footnote 155: See Carte's Hist. of England, vol. i. p. 278.]

The independent Britons appear to have relapsed into the state of
original barbarism, from whence they had been imperfectly reclaimed.
Separated by their enemies from the rest of mankind, they soon became
an object of scandal and abhorrence to the Catholic world. [156]
Christianity was still professed in the mountains of Wales; but the rude
schismatics, in the form of the clerical tonsure, and in the day of the
celebration of Easter, obstinately resisted the imperious mandates
of the Roman pontiffs. The use of the Latin language was insensibly
abolished, and the Britons were deprived of the art and learning which
Italy communicated to her Saxon proselytes. In Wales and Armorica,
the Celtic tongue, the native idiom of the West, was preserved and
propagated; and the Bards, who had been the companions of the Druids,
were still protected, in the sixteenth century, by the laws of
Elizabeth. Their chief, a respectable officer of the courts of Pengwern,
or Aberfraw, or Caermarthen, accompanied the king's servants to war: the
monarchy of the Britons, which he sung in the front of battle, excited
their courage, and justified their depredations; and the songster
claimed for his legitimate prize the fairest heifer of the spoil.
His subordinate ministers, the masters and disciples of vocal and
instrumental music, visited, in their respective circuits, the royal,
the noble, and the plebeian houses; and the public poverty, almost
exhausted by the clergy, was oppressed by the importunate demands of the
bards. Their rank and merit were ascertained by solemn trials, and the
strong belief of supernatural inspiration exalted the fancy of the poet,
and of his audience. [157] The last retreats of Celtic freedom,
the extreme territories of Gaul and Britain, were less adapted to
agriculture than to pasturage: the wealth of the Britons consisted in
their flocks and herds; milk and flesh were their ordinary food; and
bread was sometimes esteemed, or rejected, as a foreign luxury. Liberty
had peopled the mountains of Wales and the morasses of Armorica; but
their populousness has been maliciously ascribed to the loose practice
of polygamy; and the houses of these licentious barbarians have been
supposed to contain ten wives, and perhaps fifty children. [158] Their
disposition was rash and choleric; they were bold in action and in
speech; [159] and as they were ignorant of the arts of peace, they
alternately indulged their passions in foreign and domestic war.
The cavalry of Armorica, the spearmen of Gwent, and the archers of
Merioneth, were equally formidable; but their poverty could seldom
procure either shields or helmets; and the inconvenient weight would
have retarded the speed and agility of their desultory operations. One
of the greatest of the English monarchs was requested to satisfy the
curiosity of a Greek emperor concerning the state of Britain; and Henry
II. could assert, from his personal experience, that Wales was inhabited
by a race of naked warriors, who encountered, without fear, the
defensive armor of their enemies. [160]

[Footnote 156: At the conclusion of his history, (A.D. 731,) Bede
describes the ecclesiastical state of the island, and censures the
implacable, though impotent, hatred of the Britons against the English
nation, and the Catholic church, (l. v. c. 23, p. 219.)]

[Footnote 157: Mr. Pennant's Tour in Wales (p. 426-449) has furnished me
with a curious and interesting account of the Welsh bards. In the year
1568, a session was held at Caerwys by the special command of Queen
Elizabeth, and regular degrees in vocal and instrumental music were
conferred on fifty-five minstrels. The prize (a silver harp) was
adjudged by the Mostyn family.]

[Footnote 158: Regio longe lateque diffusa, milite, magis quam credibile
sit, referta. Partibus equidem in illis miles unus quinquaginta generat,
sortitus more barbaro denas aut amplius uxores. This reproach of William
of Poitiers (in the Historians of France, tom. xi. p. 88) is disclaimed
by the Benedictine editors.]

[Footnote 159: Giraldus Cambrensis confines this gift of bold and ready
eloquence to the Romans, the French, and the Britons. The malicious
Welshman insinuates that the English taciturnity might possibly be the
effect of their servitude under the Normans.]

[Footnote 160: The picture of Welsh and Armorican manners is drawn
from Giraldus, (Descript. Cambriae, c. 6-15, inter Script. Camden. p.
886-891,) and the authors quoted by the Abbe de Vertot, (Hist. Critique
tom. ii. p. 259-266.)]

By the revolution of Britain, the limits of science, as well as of
empire, were contracted. The dark cloud, which had been cleared by the
Phoenician discoveries, and finally dispelled by the arms of Caesar,
again settled on the shores of the Atlantic, and a Roman province was
again lost among the fabulous Islands of the Ocean. One hundred and
fifty years after the reign of Honorius, the gravest historian of the
times [161] describes the wonders of a remote isle, whose eastern and
western parts are divided by an antique wall, the boundary of life
and death, or, more properly, of truth and fiction. The east is a fair
country, inhabited by a civilized people: the air is healthy, the waters
are pure and plentiful, and the earth yields her regular and fruitful
increase. In the west, beyond the wall, the air is infectious and
mortal; the ground is covered with serpents; and this dreary solitude
is the region of departed spirits, who are transported from the opposite
shores in substantial boats, and by living rowers. Some families of
fishermen, the subjects of the Franks, are excused from tribute, in
consideration of the mysterious office which is performed by these
Charons of the ocean. Each in his turn is summoned, at the hour of
midnight, to hear the voices, and even the names, of the ghosts: he is
sensible of their weight, and he feels himself impelled by an unknown,
but irresistible power. After this dream of fancy, we read with
astonishment, that the name of this island is Brittia; that it lies in
the ocean, against the mouth of the Rhine, and less than thirty miles
from the continent; that it is possessed by three nations, the Frisians,
the Angles, and the Britons; and that some Angles had appeared at
Constantinople, in the train of the French ambassadors. From these
ambassadors Procopius might be informed of a singular, though not
improbable, adventure, which announces the spirit, rather than the
delicacy, of an English heroine. She had been betrothed to Radiger, king
of the Varni, a tribe of Germans who touched the ocean and the Rhine;
but the perfidious lover was tempted, by motives of policy, to prefer
his father's widow, the sister of Theodebert, king of the Franks. [162]
The forsaken princess of the Angles, instead of bewailing, revenged her
disgrace. Her warlike subjects are said to have been ignorant of the
use, and even of the form, of a horse; but she boldly sailed from
Britain to the mouth of the Rhine, with a fleet of four hundred ships,
and an army of one hundred thousand men. After the loss of a battle,
the captive Radiger implored the mercy of his victorious bride, who
generously pardoned his offence, dismissed her rival, and compelled the
king of the Varni to discharge with honor and fidelity the duties of
a husband. [163] This gallant exploit appears to be the last naval
enterprise of the Anglo-Saxons. The arts of navigation, by which they
acquired the empire of Britain and of the sea, were soon neglected
by the indolent Barbarians, who supinely renounced all the commercial
advantages of their insular situation. Seven independent kingdoms
were agitated by perpetual discord; and the British world was seldom
connected, either in peace or war, with the nations of the Continent.
[164]

[Footnote 161: See Procopius de Bell. Gothic. l. iv. c. 20, p. 620-625.
The Greek historian is himself so confounded by the wonders which he
relates, that he weakly attempts to distinguish the islands of
Britia and Britain, which he has identified by so many inseparable
circumstances.]

[Footnote 162: Theodebert, grandson of Clovis, and king of Austrasia,
was the most powerful and warlike prince of the age; and this remarkable
adventure may be placed between the years 534 and 547, the extreme
terms of his reign. His sister Theudechildis retired to Sens, where
she founded monasteries, and distributed alms, (see the notes of the
Benedictine editors, in tom. ii. p. 216.) If we may credit the praises
of Fortunatus, (l. vi. carm. 5, in tom. ii. p. 507,) Radiger was
deprived of a most valuable wife.]

[Footnote 163: Perhaps she was the sister of one of the princes or
chiefs of the Angles, who landed in 527, and the following years,
between the Humber and the Thames, and gradually founded the kingdoms of
East Anglia and Mercia. The English writers are ignorant of her name and
existence: but Procopius may have suggested to Mr. Rowe the character
and situation of Rodogune in the tragedy of the Royal Convert.]

[Footnote 164: In the copious history of Gregory of Tours, we cannot
find any traces of hostile or friendly intercourse between France and
England except in the marriage of the daughter of Caribert, king of
Paris, quam regis cujusdam in Cantia filius matrimonio copulavit, (l.
ix. c. 28, in tom. ii. p. 348.) The bishop of Tours ended his history
and his life almost immediately before the conversion of Kent.]

I have now accomplished the laborious narrative of the decline and fall
of the Roman empire, from the fortunate age of Trajan and the Antonines,
to its total extinction in the West, about five centuries after the
Christian era. At that unhappy period, the Saxons fiercely struggled
with the natives for the possession of Britain: Gaul and Spain were
divided between the powerful monarchies of the Franks and Visigoths, and
the dependent kingdoms of the Suevi and Burgundians: Africa was exposed
to the cruel persecution of the Vandals, and the savage insults of the
Moors: Rome and Italy, as far as the banks of the Danube, were afflicted
by an army of Barbarian mercenaries, whose lawless tyranny was succeeded
by the reign of Theodoric the Ostrogoth. All the subjects of the empire,
who, by the use of the Latin language, more particularly deserved
the name and privileges of Romans, were oppressed by the disgrace and
calamities of foreign conquest; and the victorious nations of Germany
established a new system of manners and government in the western
countries of Europe. The majesty of Rome was faintly represented by
the princes of Constantinople, the feeble and imaginary successors of
Augustus. Yet they continued to reign over the East, from the Danube to
the Nile and Tigris; the Gothic and Vandal kingdoms of Italy and Africa
were subverted by the arms of Justinian; and the history of the Greek
emperors may still afford a long series of instructive lessons, and
interesting revolutions.
