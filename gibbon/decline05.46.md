## Chapter LVIII: The First Crusade.--Part III.

Between the age of Charlemagne and that of the crusades, a revolution
had taken place among the Spaniards, the Normans, and the French,
which was gradually extended to the rest of Europe. The service of the
infantry was degraded to the plebeians; the cavalry formed the strength
of the armies, and the honorable name of miles, or soldier, was confined
to the gentlemen [55] who served on horseback, and were invested with
the character of knighthood. The dukes and counts, who had usurped
the rights of sovereignty, divided the provinces among their faithful
barons: the barons distributed among their vassals the fiefs or
benefices of their jurisdiction; and these military tenants, the peers
of each other and of their lord, composed the noble or equestrian
order, which disdained to conceive the peasant or burgher as of the same
species with themselves. The dignity of their birth was preserved by
pure and equal alliances; their sons alone, who could produce four
quarters or lines of ancestry without spot or reproach, might legally
pretend to the honor of knighthood; but a valiant plebeian was sometimes
enriched and ennobled by the sword, and became the father of a new race.
A single knight could impart, according to his judgment, the character
which he received; and the warlike sovereigns of Europe derived more
glory from this personal distinction than from the lustre of their
diadem. This ceremony, of which some traces may be found in Tacitus and
the woods of Germany, [56] was in its origin simple and profane; the
candidate, after some previous trial, was invested with the sword and
spurs; and his cheek or shoulder was touched with a slight blow, as an
emblem of the last affront which it was lawful for him to endure. But
superstition mingled in every public and private action of life: in
the holy wars, it sanctified the profession of arms; and the order of
chivalry was assimilated in its rights and privileges to the sacred
orders of priesthood. The bath and white garment of the novice were
an indecent copy of the regeneration of baptism: his sword, which he
offered on the altar, was blessed by the ministers of religion: his
solemn reception was preceded by fasts and vigils; and he was created
a knight in the name of God, of St. George, and of St. Michael the
archangel. He swore to accomplish the duties of his profession;
and education, example, and the public opinion, were the inviolable
guardians of his oath. As the champion of God and the ladies, (I blush
to unite such discordant names,) he devoted himself to speak the truth;
to maintain the right; to protect the distressed; to practise courtesy,
a virtue less familiar to the ancients; to pursue the infidels; to
despise the allurements of ease and safety; and to vindicate in every
perilous adventure the honor of his character. The abuse of the same
spirit provoked the illiterate knight to disdain the arts of industry
and peace; to esteem himself the sole judge and avenger of his own
injuries; and proudly to neglect the laws of civil society and military
discipline. Yet the benefits of this institution, to refine the temper
of Barbarians, and to infuse some principles of faith, justice, and
humanity, were strongly felt, and have been often observed. The asperity
of national prejudice was softened; and the community of religion and
arms spread a similar color and generous emulation over the face of
Christendom. Abroad in enterprise and pilgrimage, at home in martial
exercise, the warriors of every country were perpetually associated; and
impartial taste must prefer a Gothic tournament to the Olympic games of
classic antiquity. [57] Instead of the naked spectacles which corrupted
the manners of the Greeks, and banished from the stadium the virgins
and matrons, the pompous decoration of the lists was crowned with the
presence of chaste and high-born beauty, from whose hands the conqueror
received the prize of his dexterity and courage. The skill and strength
that were exerted in wrestling and boxing bear a distant and doubtful
relation to the merit of a soldier; but the tournaments, as they were
invented in France, and eagerly adopted both in the East and West,
presented a lively image of the business of the field. The single
combats, the general skirmish, the defence of a pass, or castle, were
rehearsed as in actual service; and the contest, both in real and mimic
war, was decided by the superior management of the horse and lance. The
lance was the proper and peculiar weapon of the knight: his horse was
of a large and heavy breed; but this charger, till he was roused by the
approaching danger, was usually led by an attendant, and he quietly rode
a pad or palfrey of a more easy pace. His helmet and sword, his greaves
and buckler, it would be superfluous to describe; but I may remark,
that, at the period of the crusades, the armor was less ponderous than
in later times; and that, instead of a massy cuirass, his breast was
defended by a hauberk or coat of mail. When their long lances were fixed
in the rest, the warriors furiously spurred their horses against the
foe; and the light cavalry of the Turks and Arabs could seldom stand
against the direct and impetuous weight of their charge. Each knight was
attended to the field by his faithful squire, a youth of equal birth and
similar hopes; he was followed by his archers and men at arms, and four,
or five, or six soldiers were computed as the furniture of a complete
lance. In the expeditions to the neighboring kingdoms or the Holy Land,
the duties of the feudal tenure no longer subsisted; the voluntary
service of the knights and their followers were either prompted by zeal
or attachment, or purchased with rewards and promises; and the numbers
of each squadron were measured by the power, the wealth, and the fame,
of each independent chieftain. They were distinguished by his banner,
his armorial coat, and his cry of war; and the most ancient families
of Europe must seek in these achievements the origin and proof of
their nobility. In this rapid portrait of chivalry I have been urged to
anticipate on the story of the crusades, at once an effect and a cause,
of this memorable institution. [58]

[Footnote 55: Of the words gentilis, gentilhomme, gentleman, two
etymologies are produced: 1. From the Barbarians of the fifth century,
the soldiers, and at length the conquerors of the Roman empire, who were
vain of their foreign nobility; and 2. From the sense of the civilians,
who consider gentilis as synonymous with ingenuus. Selden inclines to
the first but the latter is more pure, as well as probable.]

reasons, the reader may weigh the apology of Lucian, in the character of
Solon. See West on the Olympic Games, in his Pindar, vol. ii. p. 86-96

[Footnote 58: On the curious subjects of knighthood, knights-service,
nobility, arms, cry of war, banners, and tournaments, an ample fund of
information may be sought in Selden, (Opera, tom. iii. part i. Titles

398-412, &c.,) Dissertations sur Joinville, (i. vi.--xii. p. 127-142,

Such were the troops, and such the leaders, who assumed the cross for
the deliverance of the holy sepulchre. As soon as they were relieved by
the absence of the plebeian multitude, they encouraged each other,
by interviews and messages, to accomplish their vow, and hasten their
departure. Their wives and sisters were desirous of partaking the danger
and merit of the pilgrimage: their portable treasures were conveyed in
bars of silver and gold; and the princes and barons were attended by
their equipage of hounds and hawks to amuse their leisure and to supply
their table. The difficulty of procuring subsistence for so many myriads
of men and horses engaged them to separate their forces: their choice
or situation determined the road; and it was agreed to meet in
the neighborhood of Constantinople, and from thence to begin their
operations against the Turks. From the banks of the Meuse and the
Moselle, Godfrey of Bouillon followed the direct way of Germany,
Hungary, and Bulgaria; and, as long as he exercised the sole command
every step afforded some proof of his prudence and virtue. On the
confines of Hungary he was stopped three weeks by a Christian people,
to whom the name, or at least the abuse, of the cross was justly odious.
The Hungarians still smarted with the wounds which they had received
from the first pilgrims: in their turn they had abused the right of
defence and retaliation; and they had reason to apprehend a severe
revenge from a hero of the same nation, and who was engaged in the same
cause. But, after weighing the motives and the events, the virtuous
duke was content to pity the crimes and misfortunes of his worthless
brethren; and his twelve deputies, the messengers of peace, requested in
his name a free passage and an equal market. To remove their suspicions,
Godfrey trusted himself, and afterwards his brother, to the faith of
Carloman, [581] king of Hungary, who treated them with a simple but
hospitable entertainment: the treaty was sanctified by their common
gospel; and a proclamation, under pain of death, restrained the
animosity and license of the Latin soldiers. From Austria to Belgrade,
they traversed the plains of Hungary, without enduring or offering an
injury; and the proximity of Carloman, who hovered on their flanks with
his numerous cavalry, was a precaution not less useful for their safety
than for his own. They reached the banks of the Save; and no sooner had
they passed the river, than the king of Hungary restored the hostages,
and saluted their departure with the fairest wishes for the success of
their enterprise. With the same conduct and discipline, Godfrey
pervaded the woods of Bulgaria and the frontiers of Thrace; and might
congratulate himself that he had almost reached the first term of his
pilgrimage, without drawing his sword against a Christian adversary.
After an easy and pleasant journey through Lombardy, from Turin to
Aquileia, Raymond and his provincials marched forty days through
the savage country of Dalmatia [59] and Sclavonia. The weather was a
perpetual fog; the land was mountainous and desolate; the natives were
either fugitive or hostile: loose in their religion and government, they
refused to furnish provisions or guides; murdered the stragglers; and
exercised by night and day the vigilance of the count, who derived
more security from the punishment of some captive robbers than from his
interview and treaty with the prince of Scodra. [60] His march between
Durazzo and Constantinople was harassed, without being stopped, by
the peasants and soldiers of the Greek emperor; and the same faint and
ambiguous hostility was prepared for the remaining chiefs, who passed
the Adriatic from the coast of Italy. Bohemond had arms and vessels,
and foresight and discipline; and his name was not forgotten in the
provinces of Epirus and Thessaly. Whatever obstacles he encountered were
surmounted by his military conduct and the valor of Tancred; and if the
Norman prince affected to spare the Greeks, he gorged his soldiers
with the full plunder of an heretical castle. [61] The nobles of France
pressed forwards with the vain and thoughtless ardor of which their
nation has been sometimes accused. From the Alps to Apulia the march of
Hugh the Great, of the two Roberts, and of Stephen of Chartres, through
a wealthy country, and amidst the applauding Catholics, was a devout or
triumphant progress: they kissed the feet of the Roman pontiff; and the
golden standard of St. Peter was delivered to the brother of the French
monarch. [62] But in this visit of piety and pleasure, they neglected
to secure the season, and the means of their embarkation: the winter was
insensibly lost: their troops were scattered and corrupted in the towns
of Italy. They separately accomplished their passage, regardless
of safety or dignity; and within nine months from the feast of the
Assumption, the day appointed by Urban, all the Latin princes had
reached Constantinople. But the count of Vermandois was produced as
a captive; his foremost vessels were scattered by a tempest; and his
person, against the law of nations, was detained by the lieutenants of
Alexius. Yet the arrival of Hugh had been announced by four-and-twenty
knights in golden armor, who commanded the emperor to revere the general
of the Latin Christians, the brother of the king of kings. [63] [631]

[Footnote 581: Carloman (or Calmany) demanded the brother of Godfrey as
hostage but Count Baldwin refused the humiliating submission. Godfrey
shamed him into this sacrifice for the common good by offering to
surrender himself Wilken, vol. i. p. 104.--M.]

[Footnote 59: The Familiae Dalmaticae of Ducange are meagre and
imperfect; the national historians are recent and fabulous, the Greeks
remote and careless. In the year 1104 Coloman reduced the maritine
country as far as Trau and Saloma, (Katona, Hist. Crit. tom. iii. p.
195-207.)]

[Footnote 60: Scodras appears in Livy as the capital and fortress of
Gentius, king of the Illyrians, arx munitissima, afterwards a Roman
colony, (Cellarius, tom. i. p. 393, 394.) It is now called Iscodar, or
Scutari, (D'Anville, Geographie Ancienne, tom. i. p. 164.) The sanjiak
(now a pacha) of Scutari, or Schendeire, was the viiith under the
Beglerbeg of Romania, and furnished 600 soldiers on a revenue of 78,787
rix dollars, (Marsigli, Stato Militare del Imperio Ottomano, p. 128.)]

cooly relating the fact, the Archbishop Baldric adds, as a praise, Omnes

Vermandois; but the patriot Ducange repeats with much complacency (Not.

passages of Matthew Paris (A.D. 1254) and Froissard, (vol. iv. p. 201,)
which style the king of France rex regum, and chef de tous les rois
Chretiens.]

Constantinople Wilken--M.]

In some oriental tale I have read the fable of a shepherd, who was
ruined by the accomplishment of his own wishes: he had prayed for water;
the Ganges was turned into his grounds, and his flock and cottage were
swept away by the inundation. Such was the fortune, or at least the
apprehension of the Greek emperor Alexius Comnenus, whose name has
already appeared in this history, and whose conduct is so differently
represented by his daughter Anne, [64] and by the Latin writers. [65]
In the council of Placentia, his ambassadors had solicited a moderate
succor, perhaps of ten thousand soldiers, but he was astonished by
the approach of so many potent chiefs and fanatic nations. The emperor
fluctuated between hope and fear, between timidity and courage; but
in the crooked policy which he mistook for wisdom, I cannot believe, I
cannot discern, that he maliciously conspired against the life or honor
of the French heroes. The promiscuous multitudes of Peter the Hermit
were savage beasts, alike destitute of humanity and reason: nor was it
possible for Alexius to prevent or deplore their destruction. The
troops of Godfrey and his peers were less contemptible, but not less
suspicious, to the Greek emperor. Their motives might be pure and pious:
but he was equally alarmed by his knowledge of the ambitious Bohemond,
[651] and his ignorance of the Transalpine chiefs: the courage of the
French was blind and headstrong; they might be tempted by the luxury and
wealth of Greece, and elated by the view and opinion of their
invincible strength: and Jerusalem might be forgotten in the prospect of
Constantinople. After a long march and painful abstinence, the troops of
Godfrey encamped in the plains of Thrace; they heard with indignation,
that their brother, the count of Vermandois, was imprisoned by the
Greeks; and their reluctant duke was compelled to indulge them in some
freedom of retaliation and rapine. They were appeased by the submission
of Alexius: he promised to supply their camp; and as they refused, in
the midst of winter, to pass the Bosphorus, their quarters were assigned
among the gardens and palaces on the shores of that narrow sea. But an
incurable jealousy still rankled in the minds of the two nations, who
despised each other as slaves and Barbarians. Ignorance is the ground of
suspicion, and suspicion was inflamed into daily provocations: prejudice
is blind, hunger is deaf; and Alexius is accused of a design to starve
or assault the Latins in a dangerous post, on all sides encompassed with
the waters. [66] Godfrey sounded his trumpets, burst the net, overspread
the plain, and insulted the suburbs; but the gates of Constantinople
were strongly fortified; the ramparts were lined with archers; and,
after a doubtful conflict, both parties listened to the voice of peace
and religion. The gifts and promises of the emperor insensibly soothed
the fierce spirit of the western strangers; as a Christian warrior, he
rekindled their zeal for the prosecution of their holy enterprise, which
he engaged to second with his troops and treasures. On the return of
spring, Godfrey was persuaded to occupy a pleasant and plentiful camp in
Asia; and no sooner had he passed the Bosphorus, than the Greek vessels
were suddenly recalled to the opposite shore. The same policy was
repeated with the succeeding chiefs, who were swayed by the example, and
weakened by the departure, of their foremost companions. By his skill
and diligence, Alexius prevented the union of any two of the confederate
armies at the same moment under the walls of Constantinople; and before
the feast of the Pentecost not a Latin pilgrim was left on the coast of
Europe.

[Footnote 64: Anna Comnena was born the 1st of December, A.D. 1083,
indiction vii., (Alexiad. l. vi. p. 166, 167.) At thirteen, the time of
the first crusade, she was nubile, and perhaps married to the younger
Nicephorus Bryennius, whom she fondly styles, (l. x. p. 295, 296.) Some
moderns have imagined, that her enmity to Bohemond was the fruit of
disappointed love. In the transactions of Constantinople and Nice, her
partial accounts (Alex. l. x. xi. p. 283-317) may be opposed to the
partiality of the Latins, but in their subsequent exploits she is brief
and ignorant.]

[Footnote 65: In their views of the character and conduct of Alexius,
Maimbourg has favored the Catholic Franks, and Voltaire has been
partial to the schismatic Greeks. The prejudice of a philosopher is less
excusable than that of a Jesuit.]

[Footnote 651: Wilken quotes a remarkable passage of William of
Malmsbury as to the secret motives of Urban and of Bohemond in urging
the crusade. Illud repositius propositum non ita vulgabatur, quod
Boemundi consilio, pene totam Europam in Asiaticam expeditionem moveret,
ut in tanto tumultu omnium provinciarum facile obaeratis auxiliaribus,
et Urbanus Romam et Boemundus Illyricum et Macedoniam pervaderent. Nam
eas terras et quidquid praeterea a Dyrrachio usque ad Thessalonicam
protenditur, Guiscardus pater, super Alexium acquisierat; ideirco illas
Boemundus suo juri competere clamitabat: inops haereditatis Apuliae,
quam genitor Rogerio, minori filio delegaverat. Wilken, vol. ii. p.
313.--M]

[Footnote 66: Between the Black Sea, the Bosphorus, and the River
Barbyses, which is deep in summer, and runs fifteen miles through a flat
meadow. Its communication with Europe and Constantinople is by the
stone bridge of the Blachernoe, which in successive ages was restored by
Justinian and Basil, (Gyllius de Bosphoro Thracio, l. ii. c. 3. Ducange

The same arms which threatened Europe might deliver Asia, and repel the
Turks from the neighboring shores of the Bosphorus and Hellespont. The
fair provinces from Nice to Antioch were the recent patrimony of the
Roman emperor; and his ancient and perpetual claim still embraced the
kingdoms of Syria and Egypt. In his enthusiasm, Alexius indulged, or
affected, the ambitious hope of leading his new allies to subvert
the thrones of the East; but the calmer dictates of reason and temper
dissuaded him from exposing his royal person to the faith of unknown
and lawless Barbarians. His prudence, or his pride, was content with
extorting from the French princes an oath of homage and fidelity, and a
solemn promise, that they

would either restore, or hold, their Asiatic conquests as the humble and
loyal vassals of the Roman empire. Their independent spirit was fired at
the mention of this foreign and voluntary servitude: they successively
yielded to the dexterous application of gifts and flattery; and the
first proselytes became the most eloquent and effectual missionaries to
multiply the companions of their shame. The pride of Hugh of Vermandois
was soothed by the honors of his captivity; and in the brother of the
French king, the example of submission was prevalent and weighty. In the
mind of Godfrey of Bouillon every human consideration was subordinate to
the glory of God and the success of the crusade. He had firmly resisted
the temptations of Bohemond and Raymond, who urged the attack and
conquest of Constantinople. Alexius esteemed his virtues, deservedly
named him the champion of the empire, and dignified his homage with the
filial name and the rights of adoption. [67] The hateful Bohemond was
received as a true and ancient ally; and if the emperor reminded him
of former hostilities, it was only to praise the valor that he had
displayed, and the glory that he had acquired, in the fields of Durazzo
and Larissa. The son of Guiscard was lodged and entertained, and served
with Imperial pomp: one day, as he passed through the gallery of the
palace, a door was carelessly left open to expose a pile of gold and
silver, of silk and gems, of curious and costly furniture, that was
heaped, in seeming disorder, from the floor to the roof of the chamber.
"What conquests," exclaimed the ambitious miser, "might not be achieved
by the possession of such a treasure!"--"It is your own," replied a
Greek attendant, who watched the motions of his soul; and Bohemond,
after some hesitation, condescended to accept this magnificent
present. The Norman was flattered by the assurance of an independent
principality; and Alexius eluded, rather than denied, his daring
demand of the office of great domestic, or general of the East. The two
Roberts, the son of the conqueror of England, and the kinsmen of three
queens, [68] bowed in their turn before the Byzantine throne. A private
letter of Stephen of Chartres attests his admiration of the emperor, the
most excellent and liberal of men, who taught him to believe that he was
a favorite, and promised to educate and establish his youngest son.
In his southern province, the count of St. Giles and Thoulouse faintly
recognized the supremacy of the king of France, a prince of a foreign
nation and language. At the head of a hundred thousand men, he declared
that he was the soldier and servant of Christ alone, and that the Greek
might be satisfied with an equal treaty of alliance and friendship. His
obstinate resistance enhanced the value and the price of his submission;
and he shone, says the princess Anne, among the Barbarians, as the sun
amidst the stars of heaven. His disgust of the noise and insolence
of the French, his suspicions of the designs of Bohemond, the emperor
imparted to his faithful Raymond; and that aged statesman might clearly
discern, that however false in friendship, he was sincere in his enmity.
[69] The spirit of chivalry was last subdued in the person of Tancred;
and none could deem themselves dishonored by the imitation of that
gallant knight. He disdained the gold and flattery of the Greek monarch;
assaulted in his presence an insolent patrician; escaped to Asia in the
habit of a private soldier; and yielded with a sigh to the authority
of Bohemond, and the interest of the Christian cause. The best and
most ostensible reason was the impossibility of passing the sea and
accomplishing their vow, without the license and the vessels of
Alexius; but they cherished a secret hope, that as soon as they trod
the continent of Asia, their swords would obliterate their shame, and
dissolve the engagement, which on his side might not be very faithfully
performed. The ceremony of their homage was grateful to a people who
had long since considered pride as the substitute of power. High on his
throne, the emperor sat mute and immovable: his majesty was adored by
the Latin princes; and they submitted to kiss either his feet or his
knees, an indignity which their own writers are ashamed to confess and
unable to deny. [70]

[Footnote 67: There are two sorts of adoption, the one by arms, the
other by introducing the son between the shirt and skin of his father.
Ducange isur Joinville, (Diss. xxii. p. 270) supposes Godfrey's adoption
to have been of the latter sort.]

[Footnote 68: After his return, Robert of Flanders became the man of the
king of England, for a pension of four hundred marks. See the first act
in Rymer's Foedera.]

[Footnote 69: Sensit vetus regnandi, falsos in amore, odia non fingere.
Tacit. vi. 44.]

[Footnote 70: The proud historians of the crusades slide and stumble
over this humiliating step. Yet, since the heroes knelt to salute the
emperor, as he sat motionless on his throne, it is clear that they must
have kissed either his feet or knees. It is only singular, that Anna
should not have amply supplied the silence or ambiguity of the Latins.
The abasement of their princes would have added a fine chapter to the
Ceremoniale Aulae Byzantinae.]

Private or public interest suppressed the murmurs of the dukes and
counts; but a French baron (he is supposed to be Robert of Paris [71]
presumed to ascend the throne, and to place himself by the side of
Alexius. The sage reproof of Baldwin provoked him to exclaim, in his
barbarous idiom, "Who is this rustic, that keeps his seat, while so many
valiant captains are standing round him?" The emperor maintained his
silence, dissembled his indignation, and questioned his interpreter
concerning the meaning of the words, which he partly suspected from the
universal language of gesture and countenance. Before the departure
of the pilgrims, he endeavored to learn the name and condition of the
audacious baron. "I am a Frenchman," replied Robert, "of the purest and
most ancient nobility of my country. All that I know is, that there is a
church in my neighborhood, [72] the resort of those who are desirous
of approving their valor in single combat. Till an enemy appears,
they address their prayers to God and his saints. That church I have
frequently visited. But never have I found an antagonist who dared to
accept my defiance." Alexius dismissed the challenger with some prudent
advice for his conduct in the Turkish warfare; and history repeats with
pleasure this lively example of the manners of his age and country.

[Footnote 71: He called himself (see Alexias, l. x. p. 301.) What a
title of noblesse of the eleventh century, if any one could now prove
his inheritance! Anna relates, with visible pleasure, that the swelling
Barbarian, was killed, or wounded, after fighting in the front in the
battle of Dorylaeum, (l. xi. p. 317.) This circumstance may justify the
suspicion of Ducange, (Not. p. 362,) that he was no other than Robert
of Paris, of the district most peculiarly styled the Duchy or Island of
France, (L'Isle de France.)]

[Footnote 72: With the same penetration, Ducange discovers his church to
be that of St. Drausus, or Drosin, of Soissons, quem duello dimicaturi
solent invocare: pugiles qui ad memoriam ejus (his tomb) pernoctant
invictos reddit, ut et de Burgundia et Italia tali necessitate
confugiatur ad eum. Joan. Sariberiensis, epist. 139.]

The conquest of Asia was undertaken and achieved by Alexander, with
thirty-five thousand Macedonians and Greeks; [73] and his best hope was
in the strength and discipline of his phalanx of infantry. The principal
force of the crusaders consisted in their cavalry; and when that force
was mustered in the plains of Bithynia, the knights and their martial
attendants on horseback amounted to one hundred thousand fighting men,
completely armed with the helmet and coat of mail. The value of these
soldiers deserved a strict and authentic account; and the flower of
European chivalry might furnish, in a first effort, this formidable body
of heavy horse. A part of the infantry might be enrolled for the service
of scouts, pioneers, and archers; but the promiscuous crowd were lost in
their own disorder; and we depend not on the eyes and knowledge, but
on the belief and fancy, of a chaplain of Count Baldwin, [74] in the
estimate of six hundred thousand pilgrims able to bear arms, besides the
priests and monks, the women and children of the Latin camp. The reader
starts; and before he is recovered from his surprise, I shall add, on
the same testimony, that if all who took the cross had accomplished
their vow, above six millions would have migrated from Europe to
Asia. Under this oppression of faith, I derive some relief from a more
sagacious and thinking writer, [75] who, after the same review of the
cavalry, accuses the credulity of the priest of Chartres, and even
doubts whether the Cisalpine regions (in the geography of a Frenchman)
were sufficient to produce and pour forth such incredible multitudes.
The coolest scepticism will remember, that of these religious volunteers
great numbers never beheld Constantinople and Nice. Of enthusiasm the
influence is irregular and transient: many were detained at home by
reason or cowardice, by poverty or weakness; and many were repulsed by
the obstacles of the way, the more insuperable as they were unforeseen,
to these ignorant fanatics. The savage countries of Hungary and Bulgaria
were whitened with their bones: their vanguard was cut in pieces by the
Turkish sultan; and the loss of the first adventure, by the sword, or
climate, or fatigue, has already been stated at three hundred thousand
men. Yet the myriads that survived, that marched, that pressed forwards
on the holy pilgrimage, were a subject of astonishment to themselves
and to the Greeks. The copious energy of her language sinks under the
efforts of the princess Anne: [76] the images of locusts, of leaves and
flowers, of the sands of the sea, or the stars of heaven, imperfectly
represent what she had seen and heard; and the daughter of Alexius
exclaims, that Europe was loosened from its foundations, and hurled
against Asia. The ancient hosts of Darius and Xerxes labor under the
same doubt of a vague and indefinite magnitude; but I am inclined to
believe, that a larger number has never been contained within the lines
of a single camp, than at the siege of Nice, the first operation of the
Latin princes. Their motives, their characters, and their arms, have
been already displayed. Of their troops the most numerous portion
were natives of France: the Low Countries, the banks of the Rhine, and
Apulia, sent a powerful reenforcement: some bands of adventurers were
drawn from Spain, Lombardy, and England; [77] and from the distant bogs
and mountains of Ireland or Scotland [78] issued some naked and savage
fanatics, ferocious at home but unwarlike abroad. Had not superstition
condemned the sacrilegious prudence of depriving the poorest or weakest
Christian of the merit of the pilgrimage, the useless crowd, with mouths
but without hands, might have been stationed in the Greek empire, till
their companions had opened and secured the way of the Lord. A small
remnant of the pilgrims, who passed the Bosphorus, was permitted to
visit the holy sepulchre. Their northern constitution was scorched by
the rays, and infected by the vapors, of a Syrian sun. They consumed,
with heedless prodigality, their stores of water and provision: their
numbers exhausted the inland country: the sea was remote, the Greeks
were unfriendly, and the Christians of every sect fled before the
voracious and cruel rapine of their brethren. In the dire necessity of
famine, they sometimes roasted and devoured the flesh of their infant
or adult captives. Among the Turks and Saracens, the idolaters of Europe
were rendered more odious by the name and reputation of Cannibals; the
spies, who introduced themselves into the kitchen of Bohemond, were
shown several human bodies turning on the spit: and the artful Norman
encouraged a report, which increased at the same time the abhorrence and
the terror of the infidels. [79]

[Footnote 73: There is some diversity on the numbers of his army; but
no authority can be compared with that of Ptolemy, who states it at five
thousand horse and thirty thousand foot, (see Usher's Annales, p 152.)]

[Footnote 74: Fulcher. Carnotensis, p. 387. He enumerates nineteen
nations of different names and languages, (p. 389;) but I do not clearly
apprehend his difference between the Franci and Galli, Itali and Apuli.
Elsewhere (p. 385) he contemptuously brands the deserters.]

[Footnote 75: Guibert, p. 556. Yet even his gentle opposition implies an
immense multitude. By Urban II., in the fervor of his zeal, it is only
rated at 300,000 pilgrims, (epist. xvi. Concil. tom. xii. p. 731.)]

[Footnote 76: Alexias, l. x. p. 283, 305. Her fastidious delicacy
complains of their strange and inarticulate names; and indeed there
is scarcely one that she has not contrived to disfigure with the proud
ignorance so dear and familiar to a polished people. I shall select only
one example, Sangeles, for the count of St. Giles.]

[Footnote 77: William of Malmsbury (who wrote about the year 1130) has
inserted in his history (l. iv. p. 130-154) a narrative of the first
crusade: but I wish that, instead of listening to the tenue murmur which
had passed the British ocean, (p. 143,) he had confined himself to the
numbers, families, and adventures of his countrymen. I find in Dugdale,
that an English Norman, Stephen earl of Albemarle and Holdernesse, led
the rear-guard with Duke Robert, at the battle of Antioch, (Baronage,
part i. p. 61.)]

[Footnote 78: Videres Scotorum apud se ferocium alias imbellium cuneos,
(Guibert, p. 471;) the crus intectum and hispida chlamys, may suit the
Highlanders; but the finibus uliginosis may rather apply to the Irish
bogs. William of Malmsbury expressly mentions the Welsh and Scots,
&c., (l. iv. p. 133,) who quitted, the former venatiorem, the latter
familiaritatem pulicum.]

[Footnote 79: This cannibal hunger, sometimes real, more frequently
an artifice or a lie, may be found in Anna Comnena, (Alexias, l. x.
p. 288,) Guibert, (p. 546,) Radulph. Cadom., (c. 97.) The stratagem is
related by the author of the Gesta Francorum, the monk Robert Baldric,
and Raymond des Agiles, in the siege and famine of Antioch.]
