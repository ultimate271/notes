## Chapter XXVI: Progress of The Huns.--Part V.

Whatever may have been the just measure of the calamities of Europe,
there was reason to fear that the same calamities would soon extend
to the peaceful countries of Asia. The sons of the Goths had been
judiciously distributed through the cities of the East; and the arts of
education were employed to polish, and subdue, the native fierceness
of their temper. In the space of about twelve years, their numbers had
continually increased; and the children, who, in the first emigration,
were sent over the Hellespont, had attained, with rapid growth, the
strength and spirit of perfect manhood. [102] It was impossible to
conceal from their knowledge the events of the Gothic war; and, as
those daring youths had not studied the language of dissimulation, they
betrayed their wish, their desire, perhaps their intention, to emulate
the glorious example of their fathers The danger of the times seemed to
justify the jealous suspicions of the provincials; and these suspicions
were admitted as unquestionable evidence, that the Goths of Asia had
formed a secret and dangerous conspiracy against the public safety. The
death of Valens had left the East without a sovereign; and Julius, who
filled the important station of master-general of the troops, with a
high reputation of diligence and ability, thought it his duty to consult
the senate of Constantinople; which he considered, during the vacancy of
the throne, as the representative council of the nation. As soon as he
had obtained the discretionary power of acting as he should judge most
expedient for the good of the republic, he assembled the principal
officers, and privately concerted effectual measures for the execution
of his bloody design. An order was immediately promulgated, that, on a
stated day, the Gothic youth should assemble in the capital cities
of their respective provinces; and, as a report was industriously
circulated, that they were summoned to receive a liberal gift of lands
and money, the pleasing hope allayed the fury of their resentment, and,
perhaps, suspended the motions of the conspiracy. On the appointed day,
the unarmed crowd of the Gothic youth was carefully collected in the
square or Forum; the streets and avenues were occupied by the Roman
troops, and the roofs of the houses were covered with archers and
slingers. At the same hour, in all the cities of the East, the signal
was given of indiscriminate slaughter; and the provinces of Asia were
delivered by the cruel prudence of Julius, from a domestic enemy, who,
in a few months, might have carried fire and sword from the Hellespont
to the Euphrates. [103] The urgent consideration of the public safety
may undoubtedly authorize the violation of every positive law. How far
that, or any other, consideration may operate to dissolve the natural
obligations of humanity and justice, is a doctrine of which I still
desire to remain ignorant.

[Footnote 102: Eunapius (in Excerpt. Legat. p. 20) foolishly supposes a
praeternatural growth of the young Goths, that he may introduce Cadmus's
armed men, who sprang from the dragon's teeth, &c. Such was the Greek
eloquence of the times.]

[Footnote 103: Ammianus evidently approves this execution, efficacia
velox et salutaris, which concludes his work, (xxxi. 16.) Zosimus, who
is curious and copious, (l. iv. p. 233--236,) mistakes the date, and
labors to find the reason, why Julius did not consult the emperor
Theodosius who had not yet ascended the throne of the East.]

The emperor Gratian was far advanced on his march towards the plains
of Hadrianople, when he was informed, at first by the confused voice
of fame, and afterwards by the more accurate reports of Victor and
Richomer, that his impatient colleague had been slain in battle, and
that two thirds of the Roman army were exterminated by the sword of the
victorious Goths. Whatever resentment the rash and jealous vanity of his
uncle might deserve, the resentment of a generous mind is easily subdued
by the softer emotions of grief and compassion; and even the sense of
pity was soon lost in the serious and alarming consideration of the
state of the republic. Gratian was too late to assist, he was too weak
to revenge, his unfortunate colleague; and the valiant and modest youth
felt himself unequal to the support of a sinking world. A formidable
tempest of the Barbarians of Germany seemed ready to burst over the
provinces of Gaul; and the mind of Gratian was oppressed and distracted
by the administration of the Western empire. In this important crisis,
the government of the East, and the conduct of the Gothic war, required
the undivided attention of a hero and a statesman. A subject invested
with such ample command would not long have preserved his fidelity to a
distant benefactor; and the Imperial council embraced the wise and manly
resolution of conferring an obligation, rather than of yielding to an
insult. It was the wish of Gratian to bestow the purple as the reward
of virtue; but, at the age of nineteen, it is not easy for a prince,
educated in the supreme rank, to understand the true characters of his
ministers and generals. He attempted to weigh, with an impartial hand,
their various merits and defects; and, whilst he checked the rash
confidence of ambition, he distrusted the cautious wisdom which
despaired of the republic. As each moment of delay diminished something
of the power and resources of the future sovereign of the East, the
situation of the times would not allow a tedious debate. The choice of
Gratian was soon declared in favor of an exile, whose father, only three
years before, had suffered, under the sanction of his authority, an
unjust and ignominious death. The great Theodosius, a name celebrated
in history, and dear to the Catholic church, [104] was summoned to
the Imperial court, which had gradually retreated from the confines
of Thrace to the more secure station of Sirmium. Five months after
the death of Valens, the emperor Gratian produced before the assembled
troops his colleague and their master; who, after a modest, perhaps
a sincere, resistance, was compelled to accept, amidst the general
acclamations, the diadem, the purple, and the equal title of Augustus.
[105] The provinces of Thrace, Asia, and Egypt, over which Valens had
reigned, were resigned to the administration of the new emperor; but,
as he was specially intrusted with the conduct of the Gothic war, the
Illyrian praefecture was dismembered; and the two great dioceses of
Dacia and Macedonia were added to the dominions of the Eastern empire.
[106]

[Footnote 104: A life of Theodosius the Great was composed in the last
century, (Paris, 1679, in 4to-1680, 12mo.,) to inflame the mind of
the young Dauphin with Catholic zeal. The author, Flechier, afterwards
bishop of Nismes, was a celebrated preacher; and his history is adorned,
or tainted, with pulpit eloquence; but he takes his learning from
Baronius, and his principles from St. Ambrose and St Augustin.]

The same province, and perhaps the same city, [107] which had given to
the throne the virtues of Trajan, and the talents of Hadrian, was the
orignal seat of another family of Spaniards, who, in a less fortunate
age, possessed, near fourscore years, the declining empire of Rome.
[108] They emerged from the obscurity of municipal honors by the active
spirit of the elder Theodosius, a general whose exploits in Britain
and Africa have formed one of the most splendid parts of the annals
of Valentinian. The son of that general, who likewise bore the name of
Theodosius, was educated, by skilful preceptors, in the liberal studies
of youth; but he was instructed in the art of war by the tender care
and severe discipline of his father. [109] Under the standard of such a
leader, young Theodosius sought glory and knowledge, in the most distant
scenes of military action; inured his constitution to the difference
of seasons and climates; distinguished his valor by sea and land; and
observed the various warfare of the Scots, the Saxons, and the Moors.
His own merit, and the recommendation of the conqueror of Africa, soon
raised him to a separate command; and, in the station of Duke of Misaea,
he vanquished an army of Sarmatians; saved the province; deserved the
love of the soldiers; and provoked the envy of the court. [110] His
rising fortunes were soon blasted by the disgrace and execution of his
illustrious father; and Theodosius obtained, as a favor, the permission
of retiring to a private life in his native province of Spain. He
displayed a firm and temperate character in the ease with which he
adapted himself to this new situation. His time was almost equally
divided between the town and country; the spirit, which had animated his
public conduct, was shown in the active and affectionate performance
of every social duty; and the diligence of the soldier was profitably
converted to the improvement of his ample patrimony, [111] which lay
between Valladolid and Segovia, in the midst of a fruitful district,
still famous for a most exquisite breed of sheep. [112] From the
innocent, but humble labors of his farm, Theodosius was transported,
in less than four months, to the throne of the Eastern empire; and
the whole period of the history of the world will not perhaps afford
a similar example, of an elevation at the same time so pure and so
honorable. The princes who peaceably inherit the sceptre of their
fathers, claim and enjoy a legal right, the more secure as it is
absolutely distinct from the merits of their personal characters. The
subjects, who, in a monarchy, or a popular state, acquire the possession
of supreme power, may have raised themselves, by the superiority either
of genius or virtue, above the heads of their equals; but their
virtue is seldom exempt from ambition; and the cause of the successful
candidate is frequently stained by the guilt of conspiracy, or civil
war. Even in those governments which allow the reigning monarch to
declare a colleague or a successor, his partial choice, which may be
influenced by the blindest passions, is often directed to an unworthy
object But the most suspicious malignity cannot ascribe to Theodosius,
in his obscure solitude of Caucha, the arts, the desires, or even the
hopes, of an ambitious statesman; and the name of the Exile would long
since have been forgotten, if his genuine and distinguished virtues had
not left a deep impression in the Imperial court. During the season
of prosperity, he had been neglected; but, in the public distress, his
superior merit was universally felt and acknowledged. What confidence
must have been reposed in his integrity, since Gratian could trust, that
a pious son would forgive, for the sake of the republic, the murder of
his father! What expectations must have been formed of his abilities
to encourage the hope, that a single man could save, and restore, the
empire of the East! Theodosius was invested with the purple in the
thirty-third year of his age. The vulgar gazed with admiration on the
manly beauty of his face, and the graceful majesty of his person, which
they were pleased to compare with the pictures and medals of the emperor
Trajan; whilst intelligent observers discovered, in the qualities of his
heart and understanding, a more important resemblance to the best and
greatest of the Roman princes.

veterans of Italy. The ruins still appear, about a league above Seville,
but on the opposite bank of the river. See the Hispania Illustrata of
Nonius, a short though valuable treatise, c. xvii. p. 64--67.]

[Footnote 108: I agree with Tillemont (Hist. des Empereurs, tom. v. p.
726) in suspecting the royal pedigree, which remained a secret till the
promotion of Theodosius. Even after that event, the silence of Pacatus
outweighs the venal evidence of Themistius, Victor, and Claudian, who
connect the family of Theodosius with the blood of Trajan and Hadrian.]

[Footnote 109: Pacatas compares, and consequently prefers, the youth
of Theodosius to the military education of Alexander, Hannibal, and the
second Africanus; who, like him, had served under their fathers, (xii.
8.)]

[Footnote 110: Ammianus (xxix. 6) mentions this victory of Theodosius
Junior Dux Maesiae, prima etiam tum lanugine juvenis, princeps postea
perspectissimus. The same fact is attested by Themistius and Zosimus but
Theodoret, (l. v. c. 5,) who adds some curious circumstances, strangely
applies it to the time of the interregnum.]

[Footnote 111: Pacatus (in Panegyr. Vet. xii. 9) prefers the rustic life
of Theodosius to that of Cincinnatus; the one was the effect of choice,
the other of poverty.]

[Footnote 112: M. D'Anville (Geographie Ancienne, tom. i. p. 25) has
fixed the situation of Caucha, or Coca, in the old province of Gallicia,
where Zosimus and Idatius have placed the birth, or patrimony, of
Theodosius.]

It is not without the most sincere regret, that I must now take leave of
an accurate and faithful guide, who has composed the history of his
own times, without indulging the prejudices and passions, which usually
affect the mind of a contemporary. Ammianus Marcellinus, who terminates
his useful work with the defeat and death of Valens, recommends the
more glorious subject of the ensuing reign to the youthful vigor and
eloquence of the rising generation. [113] The rising generation was not
disposed to accept his advice or to imitate his example; [114] and, in
the study of the reign of Theodosius, we are reduced to illustrate the
partial narrative of Zosimus, by the obscure hints of fragments and
chronicles, by the figurative style of poetry or panegyric, and by the
precarious assistance of the ecclesiastical writers, who, in the heat of
religious faction, are apt to despise the profane virtues of sincerity
and moderation. Conscious of these disadvantages, which will continue
to involve a considerable portion of the decline and fall of the Roman
empire, I shall proceed with doubtful and timorous steps. Yet I may
boldly pronounce, that the battle of Hadrianople was never revenged by
any signal or decisive victory of Theodosius over the Barbarians: and
the expressive silence of his venal orators may be confirmed by the
observation of the condition and circumstances of the times. The fabric
of a mighty state, which has been reared by the labors of successive
ages, could not be overturned by the misfortune of a single day, if the
fatal power of the imagination did not exaggerate the real measure of
the calamity. The loss of forty thousand Romans, who fell in the plains
of Hadrianople, might have been soon recruited in the populous provinces
of the East, which contained so many millions of inhabitants. The
courage of a soldier is found to be the cheapest, and most common,
quality of human nature; and sufficient skill to encounter an
undisciplined foe might have been speedily taught by the care of the
surviving centurions. If the Barbarians were mounted on the horses, and
equipped with the armor, of their vanquished enemies, the numerous studs
of Cappadocia and Spain would have supplied new squadrons of cavalry;
the thirty-four arsenals of the empire were plentifully stored with
magazines of offensive and defensive arms: and the wealth of Asia might
still have yielded an ample fund for the expenses of the war. But the
effects which were produced by the battle of Hadrianople on the minds
of the Barbarians and of the Romans, extended the victory of the former,
and the defeat of the latter, far beyond the limits of a single day. A
Gothic chief was heard to declare, with insolent moderation, that, for
his own part, he was fatigued with slaughter: but that he was astonished
how a people, who fled before him like a flock of sheep, could still
presume to dispute the possession of their treasures and provinces.
[115] The same terrors which the name of the Huns had spread among the
Gothic tribes, were inspired, by the formidable name of the Goths, among
the subjects and soldiers of the Roman empire. [116] If Theodosius,
hastily collecting his scattered forces, had led them into the field
to encounter a victorious enemy, his army would have been vanquished
by their own fears; and his rashness could not have been excused by
the chance of success. But the great Theodosius, an epithet which he
honorably deserved on this momentous occasion, conducted himself as the
firm and faithful guardian of the republic. He fixed his head-quarters
at Thessalonica, the capital of the Macedonian diocese; [117] from
whence he could watch the irregular motions of the Barbarians,
and direct the operations of his lieutenants, from the gates of
Constantinople to the shores of the Hadriatic. The fortifications and
garrisons of the cities were strengthened; and the troops, among whom a
sense of order and discipline was revived, were insensibly emboldened
by the confidence of their own safety. From these secure stations, they
were encouraged to make frequent sallies on the Barbarians, who infested
the adjacent country; and, as they were seldom allowed to engage,
without some decisive superiority, either of ground or of numbers, their
enterprises were, for the most part, successful; and they were soon
convinced, by their own experience, of the possibility of vanquishing
their invincible enemies. The detachments of these separate garrisons
were generally united into small armies; the same cautious measures
were pursued, according to an extensive and well-concerted plan of
operations; the events of each day added strength and spirit to the
Roman arms; and the artful diligence of the emperor, who circulated the
most favorable reports of the success of the war, contributed to subdue
the pride of the Barbarians, and to animate the hopes and courage of
his subjects. If, instead of this faint and imperfect outline, we could
accurately represent the counsels and actions of Theodosius, in four
successive campaigns, there is reason to believe, that his consummate
skill would deserve the applause of every military reader. The republic
had formerly been saved by the delays of Fabius; and, while the splendid
trophies of Scipio, in the field of Zama, attract the eyes of posterity,
the camps and marches of the dictator among the hills of the Campania,
may claim a juster proportion of the solid and independent fame, which
the general is not compelled to share, either with fortune or with his
troops. Such was likewise the merit of Theodosius; and the infirmities
of his body, which most unseasonably languished under a long and
dangerous disease, could not oppress the vigor of his mind, or divert
his attention from the public service. [118]

The deliverance and peace of the Roman provinces [119] was the work of
prudence, rather than of valor: the prudence of Theodosius was seconded
by fortune: and the emperor never failed to seize, and to improve, every
favorable circumstance. As long as the superior genius of Fritigern
preserved the union, and directed the motions of the Barbarians, their
power was not inadequate to the conquest of a great empire. The death of
that hero, the predecessor and master of the renowned Alaric, relieved
an impatient multitude from the intolerable yoke of discipline and
discretion. The Barbarians, who had been restrained by his authority,
abandoned themselves to the dictates of their passions; and their
passions were seldom uniform or consistent. An army of conquerors was
broken into many disorderly bands of savage robbers; and their blind
and irregular fury was not less pernicious to themselves, than to their
enemies. Their mischievous disposition was shown in the destruction of
every object which they wanted strength to remove, or taste to enjoy;
and they often consumed, with improvident rage, the harvests, or
the granaries, which soon afterwards became necessary for their own
subsistence. A spirit of discord arose among the independent tribes
and nations, which had been united only by the bands of a loose and
voluntary alliance. The troops of the Huns and the Alani would naturally
upbraid the flight of the Goths; who were not disposed to use with
moderation the advantages of their fortune; the ancient jealousy of
the Ostrogoths and the Visigoths could not long be suspended; and the
haughty chiefs still remembered the insults and injuries, which they had
reciprocally offered, or sustained, while the nation was seated in the
countries beyond the Danube. The progress of domestic faction abated
the more diffusive sentiment of national animosity; and the officers of
Theodosius were instructed to purchase, with liberal gifts and promises,
the retreat or service of the discontented party. The acquisition
of Modar, a prince of the royal blood of the Amali, gave a bold and
faithful champion to the cause of Rome. The illustrious deserter
soon obtained the rank of master-general, with an important command;
surprised an army of his countrymen, who were immersed in wine and
sleep; and, after a cruel slaughter of the astonished Goths, returned
with an immense spoil, and four thousand wagons, to the Imperial camp.
[120] In the hands of a skilful politician, the most different means may
be successfully applied to the same ends; and the peace of the empire,
which had been forwarded by the divisions, was accomplished by the
reunion, of the Gothic nation. Athanaric, who had been a patient
spectator of these extraordinary events, was at length driven, by the
chance of arms, from the dark recesses of the woods of Caucaland. He no
longer hesitated to pass the Danube; and a very considerable part of the
subjects of Fritigern, who already felt the inconveniences of anarchy,
were easily persuaded to acknowledge for their king a Gothic Judge,
whose birth they respected, and whose abilities they had frequently
experienced. But age had chilled the daring spirit of Athanaric; and,
instead of leading his people to the field of battle and victory, he
wisely listened to the fair proposal of an honorable and advantageous
treaty. Theodosius, who was acquainted with the merit and power of his
new ally, condescended to meet him at the distance of several miles
from Constantinople; and entertained him in the Imperial city, with
the confidence of a friend, and the magnificence of a monarch. "The
Barbarian prince observed, with curious attention, the variety of
objects which attracted his notice, and at last broke out into a sincere
and passionate exclamation of wonder. I now behold (said he) what I
never could believe, the glories of this stupendous capital! And as
he cast his eyes around, he viewed, and he admired, the commanding
situation of the city, the strength and beauty of the walls and public
edifices, the capacious harbor, crowded with innumerable vessels, the
perpetual concourse of distant nations, and the arms and discipline of
the troops. Indeed, (continued Athanaric,) the emperor of the Romans is
a god upon earth; and the presumptuous man, who dares to lift his hand
against him, is guilty of his own blood." [121] The Gothic king did not
long enjoy this splendid and honorable reception; and, as temperance
was not the virtue of his nation, it may justly be suspected, that
his mortal disease was contracted amidst the pleasures of the Imperial
banquets. But the policy of Theodosius derived more solid benefit from
the death, than he could have expected from the most faithful services,
of his ally. The funeral of Athanaric was performed with solemn rites in
the capital of the East; a stately monument was erected to his memory;
and his whole army, won by the liberal courtesy, and decent grief, of
Theodosius, enlisted under the standard of the Roman empire. [122] The
submission of so great a body of the Visigoths was productive of the
most salutary consequences; and the mixed influence of force, of reason,
and of corruption, became every day more powerful, and more extensive.
Each independent chieftain hastened to obtain a separate treaty, from
the apprehension that an obstinate delay might expose him, alone and
unprotected, to the revenge, or justice, of the conqueror. The general,
or rather the final, capitulation of the Goths, may be dated four years,
one month, and twenty-five days, after the defeat and death of the
emperor Valens. [123]

magna certamina, magna multaque praelia. The two epithets are not easily
reconciled.]

words of Jornandes, or the author whom he transcribed. Regiam urbem

650) proceeds to mention his death and funeral.]

is compelled to approve the generosity of Theodosius, so honorable to
himself, and so beneficial to the public.]

(Chron. Scaliger. p. 52) are stained with contemporary passion. The
fourteenth oration of Themistius is a compliment to Peace, and the

The provinces of the Danube had been already relieved from the
oppressive weight of the Gruthungi, or Ostrogoths, by the voluntary
retreat of Alatheus and Saphrax, whose restless spirit had prompted them
to seek new scenes of rapine and glory. Their destructive course was
pointed towards the West; but we must be satisfied with a very obscure
and imperfect knowledge of their various adventures. The Ostrogoths
impelled several of the German tribes on the provinces of Gaul;
concluded, and soon violated, a treaty with the emperor Gratian;
advanced into the unknown countries of the North; and, after an interval
of more than four years, returned, with accumulated force, to the banks
of the Lower Danube. Their troops were recruited with the fiercest
warriors of Germany and Scythia; and the soldiers, or at least
the historians, of the empire, no longer recognized the name and
countenances of their former enemies. [124] The general who commanded
the military and naval powers of the Thracian frontier, soon perceived
that his superiority would be disadvantageous to the public service;
and that the Barbarians, awed by the presence of his fleet and legions,
would probably defer the passage of the river till the approaching
winter. The dexterity of the spies, whom he sent into the Gothic camp,
allured the Barbarians into a fatal snare. They were persuaded that, by
a bold attempt, they might surprise, in the silence and darkness of
the night, the sleeping army of the Romans; and the whole multitude was
hastily embarked in a fleet of three thousand canoes. [125] The bravest
of the Ostrogoths led the van; the main body consisted of the remainder
of their subjects and soldiers; and the women and children securely
followed in the rear. One of the nights without a moon had been selected
for the execution of their design; and they had almost reached the
southern bank of the Danube, in the firm confidence that they should
find an easy landing and an unguarded camp. But the progress of the
Barbarians was suddenly stopped by an unexpected obstacle a triple line
of vessels, strongly connected with each other, and which formed an
impenetrable chain of two miles and a half along the river. While they
struggled to force their way in the unequal conflict, their right flank
was overwhelmed by the irresistible attack of a fleet of galleys, which
were urged down the stream by the united impulse of oars and of the
tide. The weight and velocity of those ships of war broke, and sunk, and
dispersed, the rude and feeble canoes of the Barbarians; their valor
was ineffectual; and Alatheus, the king, or general, of the Ostrogoths,
perished with his bravest troops, either by the sword of the Romans, or
in the waves of the Danube. The last division of this unfortunate fleet
might regain the opposite shore; but the distress and disorder of the
multitude rendered them alike incapable, either of action or counsel;
and they soon implored the clemency of the victorious enemy. On this
occasion, as well as on many others, it is a difficult task to reconcile
the passions and prejudices of the writers of the age of Theodosius. The
partial and malignant historian, who misrepresents every action of his
reign, affirms, that the emperor did not appear in the field of battle
till the Barbarians had been vanquished by the valor and conduct of his
lieutenant Promotus. [126] The flattering poet, who celebrated, in the
court of Honorius, the glory of the father and of the son, ascribes the
victory to the personal prowess of Theodosius; and almost insinuates,
that the king of the Ostrogoths was slain by the hand of the emperor.
[127] The truth of history might perhaps be found in a just medium
between these extreme and contradictory assertions.

The original treaty which fixed the settlement of the Goths, ascertained
their privileges, and stipulated their obligations, would illustrate the
history of Theodosius and his successors. The series of their history
has imperfectly preserved the spirit and substance of this single
agreement. [128] The ravages of war and tyranny had provided many large
tracts of fertile but uncultivated land for the use of those Barbarians
who might not disdain the practice of agriculture. A numerous colony of
the Visigoths was seated in Thrace; the remains of the Ostrogoths were
planted in Phrygia and Lydia; their immediate wants were supplied by
a distribution of corn and cattle; and their future industry was
encouraged by an exemption from tribute, during a certain term of years.
The Barbarians would have deserved to feel the cruel and perfidious
policy of the Imperial court, if they had suffered themselves to be
dispersed through the provinces. They required, and they obtained,
the sole possession of the villages and districts assigned for their
residence; they still cherished and propagated their native manners
and language; asserted, in the bosom of despotism, the freedom of their
domestic government; and acknowledged the sovereignty of the emperor,
without submitting to the inferior jurisdiction of the laws and
magistrates of Rome. The hereditary chiefs of the tribes and families
were still permitted to command their followers in peace and war; but
the royal dignity was abolished; and the generals of the Goths were
appointed and removed at the pleasure of the emperor. An army of forty
thousand Goths was maintained for the perpetual service of the empire of
the East; and those haughty troops, who assumed the title of Foederati,
or allies, were distinguished by their gold collars, liberal pay, and
licentious privileges. Their native courage was improved by the use
of arms and the knowledge of discipline; and, while the republic was
guarded, or threatened, by the doubtful sword of the Barbarians, the
last sparks of the military flame were finally extinguished in the minds
of the Romans. [129] Theodosius had the address to persuade his allies,
that the conditions of peace, which had been extorted from him by
prudence and necessity, were the voluntary expressions of his sincere
friendship for the Gothic nation. [130] A different mode of vindication
or apology was opposed to the complaints of the people; who loudly
censured these shameful and dangerous concessions. [131] The calamities
of the war were painted in the most lively colors; and the first
symptoms of the return of order, of plenty, and security, were
diligently exaggerated. The advocates of Theodosius could affirm, with
some appearance of truth and reason, that it was impossible to extirpate
so many warlike tribes, who were rendered desperate by the loss of their
native country; and that the exhausted provinces would be revived by a
fresh supply of soldiers and husbandmen. The Barbarians still wore
an angry and hostile aspect; but the experience of past times might
encourage the hope, that they would acquire the habits of industry and
obedience; that their manners would be polished by time, education, and
the influence of Christianity; and that their posterity would insensibly
blend with the great body of the Roman people. [132]

[Footnote 128: See Themistius, Orat. xvi. p. 211. Claudian (in Eutrop.
l. ii. 112) mentions the Phrygian colony:----Ostrogothis colitur
mistisque Gruthungis Phyrx ager----and then proceeds to name the rivers
of Lydia, the Pactolus, and Herreus.]

[Footnote 129: Compare Jornandes, (c. xx. 27,) who marks the condition
and number of the Gothic Foederati, with Zosimus, (l. iv. p. 258,) who
mentions their golden collars; and Pacatus, (in Panegyr. Vet. xii. 37,)
who applauds, with false or foolish joy, their bravery and discipline.]

[Footnote 130: Amator pacis generisque Gothorum, is the praise bestowed
by the Gothic historian, (c. xxix.,) who represents his nation as
innocent, peaceable men, slow to anger, and patient of injuries.
According to Livy, the Romans conquered the world in their own defence.]

[Footnote 131: Besides the partial invectives of Zosimus, (always
discontented with the Christian reigns,) see the grave representations
which Synesius addresses to the emperor Arcadius, (de Regno, p. 25, 26,
edit. Petav.) The philosophic bishop of Cyrene was near enough to
judge; and he was sufficiently removed from the temptation of fear or
flattery.]

[Footnote 132: Themistius (Orat. xvi. p. 211, 212) composes an elaborate
and rational apology, which is not, however, exempt from the puerilities
of Greek rhetoric. Orpheus could only charm the wild beasts of Thrace;
but Theodosius enchanted the men and women, whose predecessors in the
same country had torn Orpheus in pieces, &c.]

Notwithstanding these specious arguments, and these sanguine
expectations, it was apparent to every discerning eye, that the Goths
would long remain the enemies, and might soon become the conquerors
of the Roman empire. Their rude and insolent behavior expressed their
contempt of the citizens and provincials, whom they insulted with
impunity. [133] To the zeal and valor of the Barbarians Theodosius
was indebted for the success of his arms: but their assistance was
precarious; and they were sometimes seduced, by a treacherous and
inconstant disposition, to abandon his standard, at the moment when
their service was the most essential. During the civil war against
Maximus, a great number of Gothic deserters retired into the morasses
of Macedonia, wasted the adjacent provinces, and obliged the intrepid
monarch to expose his person, and exert his power, to suppress the
rising flame of rebellion. [134] The public apprehensions were fortified
by the strong suspicion, that these tumults were not the effect of
accidental passion, but the result of deep and premeditated design. It
was generally believed, that the Goths had signed the treaty of
peace with a hostile and insidious spirit; and that their chiefs had
previously bound themselves, by a solemn and secret oath, never to
keep faith with the Romans; to maintain the fairest show of loyalty and
friendship, and to watch the favorable moment of rapine, of conquest,
and of revenge. But as the minds of the Barbarians were not insensible
to the power of gratitude, several of the Gothic leaders sincerely
devoted themselves to the service of the empire, or, at least, of the
emperor; the whole nation was insensibly divided into two opposite
factions, and much sophistry was employed in conversation and dispute,
to compare the obligations of their first, and second, engagements. The
Goths, who considered themselves as the friends of peace, of justice,
and of Rome, were directed by the authority of Fravitta, a valiant and
honorable youth, distinguished above the rest of his countrymen by the
politeness of his manners, the liberality of his sentiments, and the
mild virtues of social life. But the more numerous faction adhered to
the fierce and faithless Priulf, [134a] who inflamed the passions,
and asserted the independence, of his warlike followers. On one of the
solemn festivals, when the chiefs of both parties were invited to the
Imperial table, they were insensibly heated by wine, till they forgot
the usual restraints of discretion and respect, and betrayed, in the
presence of Theodosius, the fatal secret of their domestic disputes.
The emperor, who had been the reluctant witness of this extraordinary
controversy, dissembled his fears and resentment, and soon dismissed the
tumultuous assembly. Fravitta, alarmed and exasperated by the insolence
of his rival, whose departure from the palace might have been the signal
of a civil war, boldly followed him; and, drawing his sword, laid
Priulf dead at his feet. Their companions flew to arms; and the faithful
champion of Rome would have been oppressed by superior numbers, if he
had not been protected by the seasonable interposition of the Imperial
guards. [135] Such were the scenes of Barbaric rage, which disgraced the
palace and table of the Roman emperor; and, as the impatient Goths could
only be restrained by the firm and temperate character of Theodosius,
the public safety seemed to depend on the life and abilities of a single
man. [136]

allowance of bread, to expiate the murder of a Gothic soldier: was the
guilt of the people. Libanius, Orat. xii. p. 394, edit. Morel.]

[Footnote 134: Zosimus, l. iv. p. 267-271. He tells a long and
ridiculous story of the adventurous prince, who roved the country with
only five horsemen, of a spy whom they detected, whipped, and killed in
an old woman's cottage, &c.]

[Footnote 135: Compare Eunapius (in Excerpt. Legat. p. 21, 22) with
Zosimus, (l. iv. p. 279.) The difference of circumstances and names must
undoubtedly be applied to the same story. Fravitta, or Travitta, was
afterwards consul, (A.D. 401.) and still continued his faithful services
to the eldest son of Theodosius. (Tillemont, Hist. des Empereurs, tom.
v. p. 467.)]

[Footnote 136: Les Goths ravagerent tout depuis le Danube jusqu'au
Bosphore; exterminerent Valens et son armee; et ne repasserent le
Danube, que pour abandonner l'affreuse solitude qu'ils avoient faite,
(Oeuvres de Montesquieu, tom. iii. p. 479. Considerations sur les Causes
de la Grandeur et de la Decadence des Romains, c. xvii.) The president
Montesquieu seems ignorant that the Goths, after the defeat of Valens,
never abandoned the Roman territory. It is now thirty years, says
Claudian, (de Bello Getico, 166, &c., A.D. 404,) Ex quo jam patrios
gens haec oblita Triones, Atque Istrum transvecta semel, vestigia fixit
Threicio funesta solo--the error is inexcusable; since it disguises
the principal and immediate cause of the fall of the Western empire of
Rome.]
