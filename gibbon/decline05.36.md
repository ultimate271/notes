The three great nations of the world, the Greeks, the Saracens, and the
Franks, encountered each other on the theatre of Italy. [1] The southern
provinces, which now compose the kingdom of Naples, were subject, for
the most part, to the Lombard dukes and princes of Beneventum; [2]
so powerful in war, that they checked for a moment the genius of
Charlemagne; so liberal in peace, that they maintained in their capital
an academy of thirty-two philosophers and grammarians. The division of
this flourishing state produced the rival principalities of Benevento,
Salerno, and Capua; and the thoughtless ambition or revenge of
the competitors invited the Saracens to the ruin of their common
inheritance. During a calamitous period of two hundred years, Italy was
exposed to a repetition of wounds, which the invaders were not capable
of healing by the union and tranquility of a perfect conquest. Their
frequent and almost annual squadrons issued from the port of Palermo,
and were entertained with too much indulgence by the Christians of
Naples: the more formidable fleets were prepared on the African coast;
and even the Arabs of Andalusia were sometimes tempted to assist or
oppose the Moslems of an adverse sect. In the revolution of human
events, a new ambuscade was concealed in the Caudine Forks, the fields
of Cannae were bedewed a second time with the blood of the Africans, and
the sovereign of Rome again attacked or defended the walls of Capua and
Tarentum. A colony of Saracens had been planted at Bari, which commands
the entrance of the Adriatic Gulf; and their impartial depredations
provoked the resentment, and conciliated the union of the two emperors.
An offensive alliance was concluded between Basil the Macedonian, the
first of his race, and Lewis the great-grandson of Charlemagne; [3] and
each party supplied the deficiencies of his associate. It would have
been imprudent in the Byzantine monarch to transport his stationary
troops of Asia to an Italian campaign; and the Latin arms would have
been insufficient if his superior navy had not occupied the mouth of the
Gulf. The fortress of Bari was invested by the infantry of the Franks,
and by the cavalry and galleys of the Greeks; and, after a defence of
four years, the Arabian emir submitted to the clemency of Lewis, who
commanded in person the operations of the siege. This important conquest
had been achieved by the concord of the East and West; but their recent
amity was soon imbittered by the mutual complaints of jealousy and
pride. The Greeks assumed as their own the merit of the conquest and
the pomp of the triumph; extolled the greatness of their powers,
and affected to deride the intemperance and sloth of the handful of
Barbarians who appeared under the banners of the Carlovingian prince.
His reply is expressed with the eloquence of indignation and truth: "We
confess the magnitude of your preparation," says the great-grandson of
Charlemagne. "Your armies were indeed as numerous as a cloud of summer
locusts, who darken the day, flap their wings, and, after a short
flight, tumble weary and breathless to the ground. Like them, ye sunk
after a feeble effort; ye were vanquished by your own cowardice; and
withdrew from the scene of action to injure and despoil our Christian
subjects of the Sclavonian coast. We were few in number, and why were
we few? Because, after a tedious expectation of your arrival, I had
dismissed my host, and retained only a chosen band of warriors to
continue the blockade of the city. If they indulged their hospitable
feasts in the face of danger and death, did these feasts abate the vigor
of their enterprise? Is it by your fasting that the walls of Bari have
been overturned? Did not these valiant Franks, diminished as they were
by languor and fatigue, intercept and vanish the three most powerful
emirs of the Saracens? and did not their defeat precipitate the fall
of the city? Bari is now fallen; Tarentum trembles; Calabria will be
delivered; and, if we command the sea, the Island of Sicily may be
rescued from the hands of the infidels. My brother," accelerate (a
name most offensive to the vanity of the Greek,) "accelerate your naval
succors, respect your allies, and distrust your flatterers." [4]

[Footnote 1: For the general history of Italy in the ixth and xth
centuries, I may properly refer to the vth, vith, and viith books of
Sigonius de Regno Italiae, (in the second volume of his works, Milan,
1732;) the Annals of Baronius, with the criticism of Pagi; the viith and
viiith books of the Istoria Civile del Regno di Napoli of Giannone; the
viith and viiith volumes (the octavo edition) of the Annali d' Italia
of Muratori, and the 2d volume of the Abrege Chronologique of M. de St.
Marc, a work which, under a superficial title, contains much genuine
learning and industry. But my long-accustomed reader will give me credit
for saying, that I myself have ascended to the fountain head, as often
as such ascent could be either profitable or possible; and that I have
diligently turned over the originals in the first volumes of Muratori's
great collection of the Scriptores Rerum Italicarum.]

has illustrated the history of the duchy of Beneventum, in his two books
Historia Principum Longobardorum, in the Scriptores of Muratori tom. ii.
pars i. p. 221-345, and tom. v. p 159-245.]

[Footnote 4: The oriental epistle of the emperor Lewis II. to the
emperor Basil, a curious record of the age, was first published by
Baronius, (Annal. Eccles. A.D. 871, No. 51-71,) from the Vatican Ms.
of Erchempert, or rather of the anonymous historian of Salerno.] These
lofty hopes were soon extinguished by the death of Lewis, and the decay
of the Carlovingian house; and whoever might deserve the honor, the
Greek emperors, Basil, and his son Leo, secured the advantage, of the
reduction of Bari The Italians of Apulia and Calabria were persuaded or
compelled to acknowledge their supremacy, and an ideal line from Mount
Garganus to the Bay of Salerno, leaves the far greater part of the
kingdom of Naples under the dominion of the Eastern empire. Beyond that
line, the dukes or republics of Amalfi [5] and Naples, who had never
forfeited their voluntary allegiance, rejoiced in the neighborhood of
their lawful sovereign; and Amalfi was enriched by supplying Europe
with the produce and manufactures of Asia. But the Lombard princes
of Benevento, Salerno, and Capua, [6] were reluctantly torn from the
communion of the Latin world, and too often violated their oaths of
servitude and tribute. The city of Bari rose to dignity and wealth, as
the metropolis of the new theme or province of Lombardy: the title of
patrician, and afterwards the singular name of Catapan, [7] was assigned
to the supreme governor; and the policy both of the church and state was
modelled in exact subordination to the throne of Constantinople. As long
as the sceptre was disputed by the princes of Italy, their efforts were
feeble and adverse; and the Greeks resisted or eluded the forces of
Germany, which descended from the Alps under the Imperial standard of
the Othos. The first and greatest of those Saxon princes was compelled
to relinquish the siege of Bari: the second, after the loss of his
stoutest bishops and barons, escaped with honor from the bloody field of
Crotona. On that day the scale of war was turned against the Franks by
the valor of the Saracens. [8] These corsairs had indeed been driven
by the Byzantine fleets from the fortresses and coasts of Italy; but a
sense of interest was more prevalent than superstition or resentment,
and the caliph of Egypt had transported forty thousand Moslems to the
aid of his Christian ally. The successors of Basil amused themselves
with the belief, that the conquest of Lombardy had been achieved, and
was still preserved by the justice of their laws, the virtues of their
ministers, and the gratitude of a people whom they had rescued from
anarchy and oppression. A series of rebellions might dart a ray of truth
into the palace of Constantinople; and the illusions of flattery were
dispelled by the easy and rapid success of the Norman adventurers.

in the Appendix (p. 1-42) of Henry Brencman's Historia Pandectarum,

[Footnote 6: Your master, says Nicephorus, has given aid and protection
prinminibus Capuano et Beneventano, servis meis, quos oppugnare
dispono.... Nova (potius nota) res est quod eorum patres et avi nostro
Imperio tributa dederunt, (Liutprand, in Legat. p. 484.) Salerno is not
mentioned, yet the prince changed his party about the same time, and
Camillo Pellegrino (Script. Rer. Ital. tom. ii. pars i. p. 285) has
nicely discerned this change in the style of the anonymous Chronicle.
On the rational ground of history and language, Liutprand (p. 480) had
asserted the Latin claim to Apulia and Calabria.]

[Footnote 7: See the Greek and Latin Glossaries of Ducange (catapanus,)
and his notes on the Alexias, (p. 275.) Against the contemporary notion,
which derives it from juxta omne, he treats it as a corruption of the
Latin capitaneus. Yet M. de St. Marc has accurately observed (Abrege
Chronologique, tom. ii. p. 924) that in this age the capitanei were not
captains, but only nobles of the first rank, the great valvassors of
Italy.]

[Footnote 8: (the Lombards), (Leon. Tactic. c. xv. p. 741.) The little
Chronicle of Beneventum (tom. ii. pars i. p. 280) gives a far different
character of the Greeks during the five years (A.D. 891-896) that Leo
was master of the city.]

The revolution of human affairs had produced in Apulia and Calabria a
melancholy contrast between the age of Pythagoras and the tenth century
of the Christian aera. At the former period, the coast of Great Greece
(as it was then styled) was planted with free and opulent cities: these
cities were peopled with soldiers, artists, and philosophers; and the
military strength of Tarentum; Sybaris, or Crotona, was not inferior to
that of a powerful kingdom. At the second aera, these once flourishing
provinces were clouded with ignorance impoverished by tyranny, and
depopulated by Barbarian war nor can we severely accuse the exaggeration
of a contemporary, that a fair and ample district was reduced to the
same desolation which had covered the earth after the general deluge.
[9] Among the hostilities of the Arabs, the Franks, and the Greeks, in
the southern Italy, I shall select two or three anecdotes expressive
of their national manners. 1. It was the amusement of the Saracens to
profane, as well as to pillage, the monasteries and churches. At
the siege of Salerno, a Mussulman chief spread his couch on the
communion-table, and on that altar sacrificed each night the virginity
of a Christian nun. As he wrestled with a reluctant maid, a beam in the
roof was accidentally or dexterously thrown down on his head; and the
death of the lustful emir was imputed to the wrath of Christ, which was
at length awakened to the defence of his faithful spouse. [10] 2. The
Saracens besieged the cities of Beneventum and Capua: after a vain
appeal to the successors of Charlemagne, the Lombards implored the
clemency and aid of the Greek emperor. [11] A fearless citizen dropped
from the walls, passed the intrenchments, accomplished his commission,
and fell into the hands of the Barbarians as he was returning with the
welcome news. They commanded him to assist their enterprise, and deceive
his countrymen, with the assurance that wealth and honors should be the
reward of his falsehood, and that his sincerity would be punished with
immediate death. He affected to yield, but as soon as he was conducted
within hearing of the Christians on the rampart, "Friends and brethren,"
he cried with a loud voice, "be bold and patient, maintain the city;
your sovereign is informed of your distress, and your deliverers are
at hand. I know my doom, and commit my wife and children to your
gratitude." The rage of the Arabs confirmed his evidence; and the
self-devoted patriot was transpierced with a hundred spears. He deserves
to live in the memory of the virtuous, but the repetition of the same
story in ancient and modern times, may sprinkle some doubts on the
reality of this generous deed. [12] 3. The recital of a third incident
may provoke a smile amidst the horrors of war. Theobald, marquis of
Camerino and Spoleto, [13] supported the rebels of Beneventum; and his
wanton cruelty was not incompatible in that age with the character of a
hero. His captives of the Greek nation or party were castrated without
mercy, and the outrage was aggravated by a cruel jest, that he wished
to present the emperor with a supply of eunuchs, the most precious
ornaments of the Byzantine court. The garrison of a castle had been
defeated in a sally, and the prisoners were sentenced to the customary
operation. But the sacrifice was disturbed by the intrusion of a frantic
female, who, with bleeding cheeks dishevelled hair, and importunate
clamors, compelled the marquis to listen to her complaint. "Is it thus,"
she cried, "ye magnanimous heroes, that ye wage war against women,
against women who have never injured ye, and whose only arms are the
distaff and the loom?" Theobald denied the charge, and protested that,
since the Amazons, he had never heard of a female war. "And how," she
furiously exclaimed, "can you attack us more directly, how can you wound
us in a more vital part, than by robbing our husbands of what we most
dearly cherish, the source of our joys, and the hope of our posterity?
The plunder of our flocks and herds I have endured without a murmur, but
this fatal injury, this irreparable loss, subdues my patience, and calls
aloud on the justice of heaven and earth." A general laugh applauded her
eloquence; the savage Franks, inaccessible to pity, were moved by
her ridiculous, yet rational despair; and with the deliverance of the
captives, she obtained the restitution of her effects. As she returned
in triumph to the castle, she was overtaken by a messenger, to inquire,
in the name of Theobald, what punishment should be inflicted on her
husband, were he again taken in arms. "Should such," she answered
without hesitation, "be his guilt and misfortune, he has eyes, and a
nose, and hands, and feet. These are his own, and these he may deserve
to forfeit by his personal offences. But let my lord be pleased to spare
what his little handmaid presumes to claim as her peculiar and lawful
property." [14]

[Footnote 9: Calabriam adeunt, eamque inter se divisam reperientes
funditus depopulati sunt, (or depopularunt,) ita ut deserta sit velut in
diluvio. Such is the text of Herempert, or Erchempert, according to the
two editions of Carraccioli (Rer. Italic. Script. tom. v. p. 23) and
of Camillo Pellegrino, (tom. ii. pars i. p. 246.) Both were extremely
scarce, when they were reprinted by Muratori.]

[Footnote 10: Baronius (Annal. Eccles. A.D. 874, No. 2) has drawn this
story from a Ms. of Erchempert, who died at Capua only fifteen years
after the event. But the cardinal was deceived by a false title, and
we can only quote the anonymous Chronicle of Salerno, (Paralipomena, c.
110,) composed towards the end of the xth century, and published in the
second volume of Muratori's Collection. See the Dissertations of Camillo
Pellegrino, tom. ii. pars i. p. 231-281, &c.]

[Footnote 11: Constantine Porphyrogenitus (in Vit. Basil. c. 58, p. 183)
is the original author of this story. He places it under the reigns of
Basil and Lewis II.; yet the reduction of Beneventum by the Greeks is
dated A.D. 891, after the decease of both of those princes.]

[Footnote 12: In the year 663, the same tragedy is described by Paul the
Deacon, (de Gestis Langobard. l. v. c. 7, 8, p. 870, 871, edit. Grot.,)
under the walls of the same city of Beneventum. But the actors are
different, and the guilt is imputed to the Greeks themselves, which in
the Byzantine edition is applied to the Saracens. In the late war in
Germany, M. D'Assas, a French officer of the regiment of Auvergne, is
said to have devoted himself in a similar manner. His behavior is the
more heroic, as mere silence was required by the enemy who had made him
prisoner, (Voltaire, Siecle de Louis XV. c. 33, tom. ix. p. 172.)]

[Footnote 13: Theobald, who is styled Heros by Liutprand, was properly
duke of Spoleto and marquis of Camerino, from the year 926 to 935. The
title and office of marquis (commander of the march or frontier) was
introduced into Italy by the French emperors, (Abrege Chronologique,
tom. ii. p. 545-732 &c.)]

[Footnote 14: Liutprand, Hist. l. iv. c. iv. in the Rerum Italic.
Script. tom. i. pars i. p. 453, 454. Should the licentiousness of the
tale be questioned, I may exclaim, with poor Sterne, that it is hard
if I may not transcribe with caution what a bishop could write without
scruple What if I had translated, ut viris certetis testiculos amputare,
in quibus nostri corporis refocillatio, &c.?]

The establishment of the Normans in the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily
[15] is an event most romantic in its origin, and in its consequences
most important both to Italy and the Eastern empire. The broken
provinces of the Greeks, Lombards, and Saracens, were exposed to every
invader, and every sea and land were invaded by the adventurous spirit
of the Scandinavian pirates. After a long indulgence of rapine and
slaughter, a fair and ample territory was accepted, occupied, and named,
by the Normans of France: they renounced their gods for the God of the
Christians; [16] and the dukes of Normandy acknowledged themselves
the vassals of the successors of Charlemagne and Capet. The savage
fierceness which they had brought from the snowy mountains of Norway was
refined, without being corrupted, in a warmer climate; the companions
of Rollo insensibly mingled with the natives; they imbibed the manners,
language, [17] and gallantry, of the French nation; and in a
martial age, the Normans might claim the palm of valor and glorious
achievements. Of the fashionable superstitions, they embraced with ardor
the pilgrimages of Rome, Italy, and the Holy Land. [171] In this active
devotion, the minds and bodies were invigorated by exercise: danger was
the incentive, novelty the recompense; and the prospect of the world was
decorated by wonder, credulity, and ambitious hope. They confederated
for their mutual defence; and the robbers of the Alps, who had been
allured by the garb of a pilgrim, were often chastised by the arm of a
warrior. In one of these pious visits to the cavern of Mount Garganus
in Apulia, which had been sanctified by the apparition of the archangel
Michael, [18] they were accosted by a stranger in the Greek habit, but
who soon revealed himself as a rebel, a fugitive, and a mortal foe of
the Greek empire. His name was Melo; a noble citizen of Bari, who, after
an unsuccessful revolt, was compelled to seek new allies and avengers
of his country. The bold appearance of the Normans revived his hopes
and solicited his confidence: they listened to the complaints, and
still more to the promises, of the patriot. The assurance of wealth
demonstrated the justice of his cause; and they viewed, as the
inheritance of the brave, the fruitful land which was oppressed by
effeminate tyrants. On their return to Normandy, they kindled a spark of
enterprise, and a small but intrepid band was freely associated for the
deliverance of Apulia. They passed the Alps by separate roads, and in
the disguise of pilgrims; but in the neighborhood of Rome they were
saluted by the chief of Bari, who supplied the more indigent with arms
and horses, and instantly led them to the field of action. In the first
conflict, their valor prevailed; but in the second engagement they
were overwhelmed by the numbers and military engines of the Greeks,
and indignantly retreated with their faces to the enemy. [1811] The
unfortunate Melo ended his life a suppliant at the court of Germany: his
Norman followers, excluded from their native and their promised land,
wandered among the hills and valleys of Italy, and earned their daily
subsistence by the sword. To that formidable sword the princes of Capua,
Beneventum, Salerno, and Naples, alternately appealed in their domestic
quarrels; the superior spirit and discipline of the Normans gave victory
to the side which they espoused; and their cautious policy observed
the balance of power, lest the preponderance of any rival state should
render their aid less important, and their service less profitable.
Their first asylum was a strong camp in the depth of the marshes of
Campania: but they were soon endowed by the liberality of the duke of
Naples with a more plentiful and permanent seat. Eight miles from his
residence, as a bulwark against Capua, the town of Aversa was built
and fortified for their use; and they enjoyed as their own the corn and
fruits, the meadows and groves, of that fertile district. The report of
their success attracted every year new swarms of pilgrims and soldiers:
the poor were urged by necessity; the rich were excited by hope; and
the brave and active spirits of Normandy were impatient of ease and
ambitious of renown. The independent standard of Aversa afforded shelter
and encouragement to the outlaws of the province, to every fugitive who
had escaped from the injustice or justice of his superiors; and these
foreign associates were quickly assimilated in manners and language to
the Gallic colony. The first leader of the Normans was Count Rainulf;
and, in the origin of society, preeminence of rank is the reward and the
proof of superior merit. [19] [1911]

[Footnote 15: The original monuments of the Normans in Italy are
collected in the vth volume of Muratori; and among these we may
distinguish the poems of William Appulus (p. 245-278) and the history
of Galfridus (Jeffrey) Malaterra, (p. 537-607.) Both were natives of
France, but they wrote on the spot, in the age of the first conquerors
(before A.D. 1100,) and with the spirit of freemen. It is needless to
recapitulate the compilers and critics of Italian history, Sigonius,
Baronius, Pagi, Giannone, Muratori, St. Marc, &c., whom I have always
consulted, and never copied. * Note: M. Goutier d'Arc has discovered
a translation of the Chronicle of Aime, monk of Mont Cassino, a
contemporary of the first Norman invaders of Italy. He has made use of
it in his Histoire des Conquetes des Normands, and added a summary of
its contents. This work was quoted by later writers, but was supposed to
have been entirely lost.--M.]

[Footnote 16: Some of the first converts were baptized ten or twelve
times, for the sake of the white garment usually given at this ceremony.
At the funeral of Rollo, the gifts to monasteries for the repose of his
soul were accompanied by a sacrifice of one hundred captives. But in a
generation or two, the national change was pure and general.]

[Footnote 17: The Danish language was still spoken by the Normans
of Bayeux on the sea-coast, at a time (A.D. 940) when it was already
forgotten at Rouen, in the court and capital. Quem (Richard I.)

Normannis, l. iii. c. 8, p. 623, edit. Camden.) Of the vernacular and
favorite idiom of William the Conqueror, (A.D. 1035,) Selden (Opera,
tom. ii. p. 1640-1656) has given a specimen, obsolete and obscure even
to antiquarians and lawyers.]

[Footnote 1711: A band of Normans returning from the Holy Land had
rescued the city of Salerno from the attack of a numerous fleet of
Saracens. Gainar, the Lombard prince of Salerno wished to retain them in
his service and take them into his pay. They answered, "We fight for our
religion, and not for money." Gaimar entreated them to send some
Norman knights to his court. This seems to have been the origin of the
connection of the Normans with Italy. See Histoire des Conquetes des
Normands par Goutier d'Arc, l. i. c. i., Paris, 1830.--M.]

[Footnote 18: See Leandro Alberti (Descrizione d'Italia, p. 250) and
Baronius, (A.D. 493, No. 43.) If the archangel inherited the temple
and oracle, perhaps the cavern, of old Calchas the soothsayer, (Strab.
Geograph l. vi. p. 435, 436,) the Catholics (on this occasion) have
surpassed the Greeks in the elegance of their superstition.]

[Footnote 19: See the first book of William Appulus. His words are
applicable to every swarm of Barbarians and freebooters:--

     Si vicinorum quis pernitiosus ad illos

     Confugiebat eum gratanter suscipiebant:

     Moribus et lingua quoscumque venire videbant

     Informant propria; gens efficiatur ut una.

     And elsewhere, of the native adventurers of Normandy:--

     Pars parat, exiguae vel opes aderant quia nullae:

     Pars, quia de magnis majora subire volebant.]

[Footnote 1911: This account is not accurate. After the retreat of the
emperor Henry II. the Normans, united under the command of Rainulf, had
taken possession of Aversa, then a small castle in the duchy of Naples.
They had been masters of it a few years when Pandulf IV., prince of
Capua, found means to take Naples by surprise. Sergius, master of
the soldiers, and head of the republic, with the principal citizens,
abandoned a city in which he could not behold, without horror, the
establishment of a foreign dominion he retired to Aversa; and when, with
the assistance of the Greeks and that of the citizens faithful to their
country, he had collected money enough to satisfy the rapacity of the
Norman adventurers, he advanced at their head to attack the garrison of
the prince of Capua, defeated it, and reentered Naples. It was then that
he confirmed the Normans in the possession of Aversa and its territory,
which he raised into a count's fief, and granted the investiture to
Rainulf. Hist. des Rep. Ital. tom. i. p. 267]

Since the conquest of Sicily by the Arabs, the Grecian emperors had been
anxious to regain that valuable possession; but their efforts, however
strenuous, had been opposed by the distance and the sea. Their costly
armaments, after a gleam of success, added new pages of calamity and
disgrace to the Byzantine annals: twenty thousand of their best troops
were lost in a single expedition; and the victorious Moslems derided the
policy of a nation which intrusted eunuchs not only with the custody of
their women, but with the command of their men [20] After a reign of
two hundred years, the Saracens were ruined by their divisions. [21]
The emir disclaimed the authority of the king of Tunis; the people rose
against the emir; the cities were usurped by the chiefs; each meaner
rebel was independent in his village or castle; and the weaker of two
rival brothers implored the friendship of the Christians. In every
service of danger the Normans were prompt and useful; and five hundred
knights, or warriors on horseback, were enrolled by Arduin, the agent
and interpreter of the Greeks, under the standard of Maniaces, governor
of Lombardy. Before their landing, the brothers were reconciled; the
union of Sicily and Africa was restored; and the island was guarded to
the water's edge. The Normans led the van and the Arabs of Messina felt
the valor of an untried foe. In a second action the emir of Syracuse was
unhorsed and transpierced by the iron arm of William of Hauteville. In a
third engagement, his intrepid companions discomfited the host of sixty
thousand Saracens, and left the Greeks no more than the labor of the
pursuit: a splendid victory; but of which the pen of the historian may
divide the merit with the lance of the Normans. It is, however, true,
that they essentially promoted the success of Maniaces, who reduced
thirteen cities, and the greater part of Sicily, under the obedience
of the emperor. But his military fame was sullied by ingratitude
and tyranny. In the division of the spoils, the deserts of his brave
auxiliaries were forgotten; and neither their avarice nor their pride
could brook this injurious treatment. They complained by the mouth of
their interpreter: their complaint was disregarded; their interpreter
was scourged; the sufferings were his; the insult and resentment
belonged to those whose sentiments he had delivered. Yet they dissembled
till they had obtained, or stolen, a safe passage to the Italian
continent: their brethren of Aversa sympathized in their indignation,
and the province of Apulia was invaded as the forfeit of the debt. [22]
Above twenty years after the first emigration, the Normans took the
field with no more than seven hundred horse and five hundred foot; and
after the recall of the Byzantine legions [23] from the Sicilian war,
their numbers are magnified to the amount of threescore thousand men.
Their herald proposed the option of battle or retreat; "of battle," was
the unanimous cry of the Normans; and one of their stoutest warriors,
with a stroke of his fist, felled to the ground the horse of the Greek
messenger. He was dismissed with a fresh horse; the insult was concealed
from the Imperial troops; but in two successive battles they were more
fatally instructed of the prowess of their adversaries. In the plains of
Cannae, the Asiatics fled before the adventurers of France; the duke of
Lombardy was made prisoner; the Apulians acquiesced in a new dominion;
and the four places of Bari, Otranto, Brundusium, and Tarentum, were
alone saved in the shipwreck of the Grecian fortunes. From this aera we
may date the establishment of the Norman power, which soon eclipsed the
infant colony of Aversa. Twelve counts [24] were chosen by the popular
suffrage; and age, birth, and merit, were the motives of their choice.
The tributes of their peculiar districts were appropriated to their use;
and each count erected a fortress in the midst of his lands, and at
the head of his vassals. In the centre of the province, the common
habitation of Melphi was reserved as the metropolis and citadel of
the republic; a house and separate quarter was allotted to each of the
twelve counts: and the national concerns were regulated by this military
senate. The first of his peers, their president and general, was
entitled count of Apulia; and this dignity was conferred on William
of the iron arm, who, in the language of the age, is styled a lion in
battle, a lamb in society, and an angel in council. [25] The manners
of his countrymen are fairly delineated by a contemporary and national
historian. [26] "The Normans," says Malaterra, "are a cunning and
revengeful people; eloquence and dissimulation appear to be their
hereditary qualities: they can stoop to flatter; but unless they are
curbed by the restraint of law, they indulge the licentiousness
of nature and passion. Their princes affect the praises of popular
munificence; the people observe the medium, or rather blond the
extremes, of avarice and prodigality; and in their eager thirst of
wealth and dominion, they despise whatever they possess, and hope
whatever they desire. Arms and horses, the luxury of dress, the
exercises of hunting and hawking [27] are the delight of the Normans;
but, on pressing occasions, they can endure with incredible patience
the inclemency of every climate, and the toil and absence of a military
life." [28]

event from the Ms. history of the deacon Leo, (tom. iv. A.D. 965, No.
17-19.)]

[Footnote 22: Jeffrey Malaterra, who relates the Sicilian war, and
the conquest of Apulia, (l. i. c. 7, 8, 9, 19.) The same events are
described by Cedrenus (tom. ii. p. 741-743, 755, 756) and Zonaras,
(tom. ii. p. 237, 238;) and the Greeks are so hardened to disgrace, that
their narratives are impartial enough.]

Delisle's map.]

[Footnote 24: Omnes conveniunt; et bis sex nobiliores,

     Quos genus et gravitas morum decorabat et aetas,

       Elegere duces.  Provectis ad comitatum

     His alii parent.  Comitatus nomen honoris

     Quo donantur erat.  Hi totas undique terras

       Divisere sibi, ni sors inimica repugnet;

     Singula proponunt loca quae contingere sorte

        Cuique duci debent, et quaeque tributa locorum.

     And after speaking of Melphi, William Appulus adds,

     Pro numero comitum bis sex statuere plateas,

Atque domus comitum totidem fabricantur in urbe. Leo Ostiensis (l.
ii. c. 67) enumerates the divisions of the Apulian cities, which it is
needless to repeat.]

[Footnote 25: Gulielm. Appulus, l. ii. c 12, according to the reference
of Giannone, (Istoria Civile di Napoli, tom. ii. p. 31,) which I cannot
verify in the original. The Apulian praises indeed his validas vires,
probitas animi, and vivida virtus; and declares that, had he lived, no
poet could have equalled his merits, (l. i. p. 258, l. ii. p. 259.)
He was bewailed by the Normans, quippe qui tanti consilii virum, (says
Malaterra, l. i. c. 12, p. 552,) tam armis strenuum, tam sibi munificum,
affabilem, morigeratum, ulterius se habere diffidebant.]

[Footnote 26: The gens astutissima, injuriarum ultrix.... adulari
sciens.... eloquentiis inserviens, of Malaterra, (l. i. c. 3, p. 550,)
are expressive of the popular and proverbial character of the Normans.]

[Footnote 27: The hunting and hawking more properly belong to the
descendants of the Norwegian sailors; though they might import from
Norway and Iceland the finest casts of falcons.]

[Footnote 28: We may compare this portrait with that of William of
Malmsbury, (de Gestis Anglorum, l. iii. p. 101, 102,) who appreciates,
like a philosophic historian, the vices and virtues of the Saxons and
Normans. England was assuredly a gainer by the conquest.]
