## Chapter XXIV: The Retreat And Death Of Julian.--Part V.

The esteem of an enemy is most sincerely expressed by his fears; and
the degree of fear may be accurately measured by the joy with which he
celebrates his deliverance. The welcome news of the death of Julian,
which a deserter revealed to the camp of Sapor, inspired the desponding
monarch with a sudden confidence of victory. He immediately detached the
royal cavalry, perhaps the ten thousand Immortals, [104] to second
and support the pursuit; and discharged the whole weight of his united
forces on the rear-guard of the Romans. The rear-guard was thrown
into disorder; the renowned legions, which derived their titles from
Diocletian, and his warlike colleague, were broke and trampled down by
the elephants; and three tribunes lost their lives in attempting to stop
the flight of their soldiers. The battle was at length restored by the
persevering valor of the Romans; the Persians were repulsed with a
great slaughter of men and elephants; and the army, after marching and
fighting a long summer's day, arrived, in the evening, at Samara, on the
banks of the Tigris, about one hundred miles above Ctesiphon. [105]
On the ensuing day, the Barbarians, instead of harassing the march,
attacked the camp, of Jovian; which had been seated in a deep and
sequestered valley. From the hills, the archers of Persia insulted
and annoyed the wearied legionaries; and a body of cavalry, which had
penetrated with desperate courage through the Praetorian gate, was cut
in pieces, after a doubtful conflict, near the Imperial tent. In the
succeeding night, the camp of Carche was protected by the lofty dikes
of the river; and the Roman army, though incessantly exposed to the
vexatious pursuit of the Saracens, pitched their tents near the city of
Dura, [106] four days after the death of Julian. The Tigris was still
on their left; their hopes and provisions were almost consumed; and
the impatient soldiers, who had fondly persuaded themselves that the
frontiers of the empire were not far distant, requested their new
sovereign, that they might be permitted to hazard the passage of the
river. With the assistance of his wisest officers, Jovian endeavored to
check their rashness; by representing, that if they possessed sufficient
skill and vigor to stem the torrent of a deep and rapid stream, they
would only deliver themselves naked and defenceless to the Barbarians,
who had occupied the opposite banks, Yielding at length to their
clamorous importunities, he consented, with reluctance, that five
hundred Gauls and Germans, accustomed from their infancy to the waters
of the Rhine and Danube, should attempt the bold adventure, which might
serve either as an encouragement, or as a warning, for the rest of the
army. In the silence of the night, they swam the Tigris, surprised an
unguarded post of the enemy, and displayed at the dawn of day the signal
of their resolution and fortune. The success of this trial disposed
the emperor to listen to the promises of his architects, who propose to
construct a floating bridge of the inflated skins of sheep, oxen, and
goats, covered with a floor of earth and fascines. [107] Two important
days were spent in the ineffectual labor; and the Romans, who already
endured the miseries of famine, cast a look of despair on the Tigris,
and upon the Barbarians; whose numbers and obstinacy increased with the
distress of the Imperial army. [108]

[Footnote 104: Regius equitatus. It appears, from Irocopius, that the
Immortals, so famous under Cyrus and his successors, were revived, if we
may use that improper word, by the Sassanides. Brisson de Regno Persico,
p. 268, &c.]

[Footnote 105: The obscure villages of the inland country are
irrecoverably lost; nor can we name the field of battle where Julian
fell: but M. D'Anville has demonstrated the precise situation of Sumere,
Carche, and Dura, along the banks of the Tigris, (Geographie Ancienne,
tom. ii. p. 248 L'Euphrate et le Tigre, p. 95, 97.) In the ninth
century, Sumere, or Samara, became, with a slight change of name, the
royal residence of the khalifs of the house of Abbas. * Note: Sormanray,
called by the Arabs Samira, where D'Anville placed Samara, is too
much to the south; and is a modern town built by Caliph Morasen.
Serra-man-rai means, in Arabic, it rejoices every one who sees it. St.
Martin, iii. 133.--M.]

[Footnote 106: Dura was a fortified place in the wars of Antiochus
against the rebels of Media and Persia, (Polybius, l. v. c. 48, 52, p.
548, 552 edit. Casaubon, in 8vo.)]

[Footnote 107: A similar expedient was proposed to the leaders of the
ten thousand, and wisely rejected. Xenophon, Anabasis, l. iii. p. 255,
256, 257. It appears, from our modern travellers, that rafts floating on
bladders perform the trade and navigation of the Tigris.]

[Footnote 108: The first military acts of the reign of Jovian are
related by Ammianus, (xxv. 6,) Libanius, (Orat. Parent. c. 146, p. 364,)
and Zosimus, (l. iii. p. 189, 190, 191.) Though we may distrust the
fairness of Libanius, the ocular testimony of Eutropius (uno a Persis
atque altero proelio victus, x. 17) must incline us to suspect that
Ammianus had been too jealous of the honor of the Roman arms.]

In this hopeless condition, the fainting spirits of the Romans were
revived by the sound of peace. The transient presumption of Sapor had
vanished: he observed, with serious concern, that, in the repetition of
doubtful combats, he had lost his most faithful and intrepid nobles, his
bravest troops, and the greatest part of his train of elephants: and
the experienced monarch feared to provoke the resistance of despair, the
vicissitudes of fortune, and the unexhausted powers of the Roman empire;
which might soon advance to elieve, or to revenge, the successor of
Julian. The Surenas himself, accompanied by another satrap, appeared
in the camp of Jovian; [109] and declared, that the clemency of his
sovereign was not averse to signify the conditions on which he would
consent to spare and to dismiss the Caesar with the relics of his
captive army. [109a] The hopes of safety subdued the firmness of the
Romans; the emperor was compelled, by the advice of his council, and
the cries of his soldiers, to embrace the offer of peace; [109b] and the
praefect Sallust was immediately sent, with the general Arinthaeus, to
understand the pleasure of the Great King. The crafty Persian delayed,
under various pretenses, the conclusion of the agreement; started
difficulties, required explanations, suggested expedients, receded from
his concessions, increased his demands, and wasted four days in the arts
of negotiation, till he had consumed the stock of provisions which yet
remained in the camp of the Romans. Had Jovian been capable of executing
a bold and prudent measure, he would have continued his march, with
unremitting diligence; the progress of the treaty would have suspended
the attacks of the Barbarians; and, before the expiration of the fourth
day, he might have safely reached the fruitful province of Corduene, at
the distance only of one hundred miles. [110] The irresolute emperor,
instead of breaking through the toils of the enemy, expected his fate
with patient resignation; and accepted the humiliating conditions of
peace, which it was no longer in his power to refuse. The five provinces
beyond the Tigris, which had been ceded by the grandfather of Sapor,
were restored to the Persian monarchy. He acquired, by a single
article, the impregnable city of Nisibis; which had sustained, in three
successive sieges, the effort of his arms. Singara, and the castle of
the Moors, one of the strongest places of Mesopotamia, were likewise
dismembered from the empire. It was considered as an indulgence, that
the inhabitants of those fortresses were permitted to retire with their
effects; but the conqueror rigorously insisted, that the Romans should
forever abandon the king and kingdom of Armenia. [110a] A peace, or
rather a long truce, of thirty years, was stipulated between the hostile
nations; the faith of the treaty was ratified by solemn oaths
and religious ceremonies; and hostages of distinguished rank were
reciprocally delivered to secure the performance of the conditions.
[111]

[Footnote 109: Sextus Rufus (de Provinciis, c. 29) embraces a poor
subterfuge of national vanity. Tanta reverentia nominis Romani fuit, ut
a Persis primus de pace sermo haberetur. ---He is called Junius by John
Malala; the same, M. St. Martin conjectures, with a satrap of Gordyene
named Jovianus, or Jovinianus; mentioned in Ammianus Marcellinus, xviii.
6.--M.]

[Footnote 109a: The Persian historians couch the message of Shah-pour
in these Oriental terms: "I have reassembled my numerous army. I am
resolved to revenge my subjects, who have been plundered, made captives,
and slain. It is for this that I have bared my arm, and girded my loins.
If you consent to pay the price of the blood which has been shed, to
deliver up the booty which has been plundered, and to restore the city
of Nisibis, which is in Irak, and belongs to our empire, though now in
your possession, I will sheathe the sword of war; but should you refuse
these terms, the hoofs of my horse, which are hard as steel, shall
efface the name of the Romans from the earth; and my glorious cimeter,
that destroys like fire, shall exterminate the people of your empire."
These authorities do not mention the death of Julian. Malcolm's Persia,
i. 87.--M.]

[Footnote 109b: The Paschal chronicle, not, as M. St. Martin says,
supported by John Malala, places the mission of this ambassador before
the death of Julian. The king of Persia was then in Persarmenia,
ignorant of the death of Julian; he only arrived at the army subsequent
to that event. St. Martin adopts this view, and finds or extorts support
for it, from Libanius and Ammianus, iii. 158.--M.]

[Footnote 110: It is presumptuous to controvert the opinion of Ammianus,
a soldier and a spectator. Yet it is difficult to understand how the
mountains of Corduene could extend over the plains of Assyria, as low
as the conflux of the Tigris and the great Zab; or how an army of sixty
thousand men could march one hundred miles in four days. Note: *
Yet this appears to be the case (in modern maps: ) the march is the
difficulty.--M.]

[Footnote 110a: Sapor availed himself, a few years after, of the
dissolution of the alliance between the Romans and the Armenians. See
St. M. iii. 163.--M.]

[Footnote 111: The treaty of Dura is recorded with grief or indignation
by Ammianus, (xxv. 7,) Libanius, (Orat. Parent. c. 142, p. 364,)
Zosimus, (l. iii. p. 190, 191,) Gregory Nazianzen, (Orat. iv. p. 117,
118, who imputes the distress to Julian, the deliverance to Jovian,)
and Eutropius, (x. 17.) The last-mentioned writer, who was present in
military station, styles this peace necessarium quidem sed ignoblem.]

The sophist of Antioch, who saw with indignation the sceptre of his hero
in the feeble hand of a Christian successor, professes to admire the
moderation of Sapor, in contenting himself with so small a portion of
the Roman empire. If he had stretched as far as the Euphrates the
claims of his ambition, he might have been secure, says Libanius, of not
meeting with a refusal. If he had fixed, as the boundary of Persia,
the Orontes, the Cydnus, the Sangarius, or even the Thracian Bosphorus,
flatterers would not have been wanting in the court of Jovian to
convince the timid monarch, that his remaining provinces would still
afford the most ample gratifications of power and luxury. [112]
Without adopting in its full force this malicious insinuation, we
must acknowledge, that the conclusion of so ignominious a treaty was
facilitated by the private ambition of Jovian. The obscure domestic,
exalted to the throne by fortune, rather than by merit, was impatient to
escape from the hands of the Persians, that he might prevent the designs
of Procopius, who commanded the army of Mesopotamia, and establish his
doubtful reign over the legions and provinces which were still ignorant
of the hasty and tumultuous choice of the camp beyond the Tigris. [113]
In the neighborhood of the same river, at no very considerable distance
from the fatal station of Dura, [114] the ten thousand Greeks, without
generals, or guides, or provisions, were abandoned, above twelve hundred
miles from their native country, to the resentment of a victorious
monarch. The difference of their conduct and success depended much more
on their character than on their situation. Instead of tamely resigning
themselves to the secret deliberations and private views of a single
person, the united councils of the Greeks were inspired by the generous
enthusiasm of a popular assembly; where the mind of each citizen is
filled with the love of glory, the pride of freedom, and the contempt
of death. Conscious of their superiority over the Barbarians in arms and
discipline, they disdained to yield, they refused to capitulate: every
obstacle was surmounted by their patience, courage, and military skill;
and the memorable retreat of the ten thousand exposed and insulted the
weakness of the Persian monarchy. [115]

[Footnote 112: Libanius, Orat. Parent. c. 143, p. 364, 365.]

[Footnote 113: Conditionibus..... dispendiosis Romanae reipublicae
impositis.... quibus cupidior regni quam gloriae Jovianus, imperio
rudis, adquievit. Sextus Rufus de Provinciis, c. 29. La Bleterie has
expressed, in a long, direct oration, these specious considerations of
public and private interest, (Hist. de Jovien, tom. i. p. 39, &c.)]

[Footnote 114: The generals were murdered on the bauks of the Zabatus,
(Ana basis, l. ii. p. 156, l. iii. p. 226,) or great Zab, a river of
Assyria, 400 feet broad, which falls into the Tigris fourteen hours
below Mosul. The error of the Greeks bestowed on the greater and lesser
Zab the names of the Walf, (Lycus,) and the Goat, (Capros.) They created
these animals to attend the Tiger of the East.]

[Footnote 115: The Cyropoedia is vague and languid; the Anabasis
circumstance and animated. Such is the eternal difference between
fiction and truth.]

As the price of his disgraceful concessions, the emperor might
perhaps have stipulated, that the camp of the hungry Romans should be
plentifully supplied; [116] and that they should be permitted to pass
the Tigris on the bridge which was constructed by the hands of the
Persians. But, if Jovian presumed to solicit those equitable terms, they
were sternly refused by the haughty tyrant of the East, whose clemency
had pardoned the invaders of his country. The Saracens sometimes
intercepted the stragglers of the march; but the generals and troops
of Sapor respected the cessation of arms; and Jovian was suffered to
explore the most convenient place for the passage of the river. The
small vessels, which had been saved from the conflagration of the fleet,
performed the most essential service. They first conveyed the emperor
and his favorites; and afterwards transported, in many successive
voyages, a great part of the army. But, as every man was anxious for his
personal safety, and apprehensive of being left on the hostile shore,
the soldiers, who were too impatient to wait the slow returns of the
boats, boldly ventured themselves on light hurdles, or inflated skins;
and, drawing after them their horses, attempted, with various success,
to swim across the river. Many of these daring adventurers were
swallowed by the waves; many others, who were carried along by the
violence of the stream, fell an easy prey to the avarice or cruelty of
the wild Arabs: and the loss which the army sustained in the passage of
the Tigris, was not inferior to the carnage of a day of battle. As soon
as the Romans were landed on the western bank, they were delivered from
the hostile pursuit of the Barbarians; but, in a laborious march of
two hundred miles over the plains of Mesopotamia, they endured the last
extremities of thirst and hunger. They were obliged to traverse the
sandy desert, which, in the extent of seventy miles, did not afford a
single blade of sweet grass, nor a single spring of fresh water; and
the rest of the inhospitable waste was untrod by the footsteps either
of friends or enemies. Whenever a small measure of flour could be
discovered in the camp, twenty pounds weight were greedily purchased
with ten pieces of gold: [117] the beasts of burden were slaughtered and
devoured; and the desert was strewed with the arms and baggage of
the Roman soldiers, whose tattered garments and meagre countenances
displayed their past sufferings and actual misery. A small convoy of
provisions advanced to meet the army as far as the castle of Ur; and
the supply was the more grateful, since it declared the fidelity
of Sebastian and Procopius. At Thilsaphata, [118] the emperor most
graciously received the generals of Mesopotamia; and the remains of a
once flourishing army at length reposed themselves under the walls
of Nisibis. The messengers of Jovian had already proclaimed, in the
language of flattery, his election, his treaty, and his return; and
the new prince had taken the most effectual measures to secure the
allegiance of the armies and provinces of Europe, by placing the
military command in the hands of those officers, who, from motives
of interest, or inclination, would firmly support the cause of their
benefactor. [119]

[Footnote 116: According to Rufinus, an immediate supply of provisions
was stipulated by the treaty, and Theodoret affirms, that the obligation
was faithfully discharged by the Persians. Such a fact is probable but
undoubtedly false. See Tillemont, Hist. des Empereurs, tom. iv. p. 702.]

[Footnote 117: We may recollect some lines of Lucan, (Pharsal. iv. 95,)
who describes a similar distress of Caesar's army in Spain:-- ----Saeva
fames aderat--Miles eget: toto censu non prodigus emit Exiguam Cererem.
Proh lucri pallida tabes! Non deest prolato jejunus venditor auro.
See Guichardt (Nouveaux Memoires Militaires, tom. i. p. 370-382.)
His analysis of the two campaigns in Spain and Africa is the noblest
monument that has ever been raised to the fame of Caesar.]

[Footnote 118: M. d'Anville (see his Maps, and l'Euphrate et le Tigre,
p. 92, 93) traces their march, and assigns the true position of Hatra,
Ur, and Thilsaphata, which Ammianus has mentioned. ----He does not
complain of the Samiel, the deadly hot wind, which Thevenot (Voyages,
part ii. l. i. p. 192) so much dreaded. ----Hatra, now Kadhr. Ur, Kasr
or Skervidgi. Thilsaphata is unknown--M.]

[Footnote 119: The retreat of Jovian is described by Ammianus, (xxv.
9,) Libanius, (Orat. Parent. c. 143, p. 365,) and Zosimus, (l. iii. p.
194.)]

The friends of Julian had confidently announced the success of his
expedition. They entertained a fond persuasion that the temples of the
gods would be enriched with the spoils of the East; that Persia would
be reduced to the humble state of a tributary province, governed by the
laws and magistrates of Rome; that the Barbarians would adopt the dress,
and manners, and language of their conquerors; and that the youth of
Ecbatana and Susa would study the art of rhetoric under Grecian masters.
[120] The progress of the arms of Julian interrupted his communication
with the empire; and, from the moment that he passed the Tigris, his
affectionate subjects were ignorant of the fate and fortunes of their
prince. Their contemplation of fancied triumphs was disturbed by the
melancholy rumor of his death; and they persisted to doubt, after
they could no longer deny, the truth of that fatal event. [121] The
messengers of Jovian promulgated the specious tale of a prudent and
necessary peace; the voice of fame, louder and more sincere, revealed
the disgrace of the emperor, and the conditions of the ignominious
treaty. The minds of the people were filled with astonishment and grief,
with indignation and terror, when they were informed, that the unworthy
successor of Julian relinquished the five provinces which had been
acquired by the victory of Galerius; and that he shamefully surrendered
to the Barbarians the important city of Nisibis, the firmest bulwark of
the provinces of the East. [122] The deep and dangerous question, how
far the public faith should be observed, when it becomes incompatible
with the public safety, was freely agitated in popular conversation;
and some hopes were entertained that the emperor would redeem his
pusillanimous behavior by a splendid act of patriotic perfidy. The
inflexible spirit of the Roman senate had always disclaimed the unequal
conditions which were extorted from the distress of their captive
armies; and, if it were necessary to satisfy the national honor, by
delivering the guilty general into the hands of the Barbarians, the
greatest part of the subjects of Jovian would have cheerfully acquiesced
in the precedent of ancient times. [123]

[Footnote 120: Libanius, (Orat. Parent. c. 145, p. 366.) Such were the
natural hopes and wishes of a rhetorician.]

[Footnote 121: The people of Carrhae, a city devoted to Paganism, buried
the inauspicious messenger under a pile of stones, (Zosimus, l. iii. p.
196.) Libanius, when he received the fatal intelligence, cast his eye on
his sword; but he recollected that Plato had condemned suicide, and that
he must live to compose the Panegyric of Julian, (Libanius de Vita sua,
tom. ii. p. 45, 46.)]

[Footnote 122: Ammianus and Eutropius may be admitted as fair and
credible witnesses of the public language and opinions. The people
of Antioch reviled an ignominious peace, which exposed them to the
Persians, on a naked and defenceless frontier, (Excerpt. Valesiana, p.
845, ex Johanne Antiocheno.)]

[Footnote 123: The Abbe de la Bleterie, (Hist. de Jovien, tom. i. p.
212-227.) though a severe casuist, has pronounced that Jovian was not
bound to execute his promise; since he could not dismember the empire,
nor alienate, without their consent, the allegiance of his people.
I have never found much delight or instruction in such political
metaphysics.]

But the emperor, whatever might be the limits of his constitutional
authority, was the absolute master of the laws and arms of the state;
and the same motives which had forced him to subscribe, now pressed him
to execute, the treaty of peace. He was impatient to secure an empire
at the expense of a few provinces; and the respectable names of
religion and honor concealed the personal fears and ambition of Jovian.
Notwithstanding the dutiful solicitations of the inhabitants, decency,
as well as prudence, forbade the emperor to lodge in the palace of
Nisibis; but the next morning after his arrival. Bineses, the ambassador
of Persia, entered the place, displayed from the citadel the standard
of the Great King, and proclaimed, in his name, the cruel alternative
of exile or servitude. The principal citizens of Nisibis, who, till that
fatal moment, had confided in the protection of their sovereign, threw
themselves at his feet. They conjured him not to abandon, or, at least,
not to deliver, a faithful colony to the rage of a Barbarian tyrant,
exasperated by the three successive defeats which he had experienced
under the walls of Nisibis. They still possessed arms and courage to
repel the invaders of their country: they requested only the permission
of using them in their own defence; and, as soon as they had asserted
their independence, they should implore the favor of being again
admitted into the ranks of his subjects. Their arguments, their
eloquence, their tears, were ineffectual. Jovian alleged, with some
confusion, the sanctity of oaths; and, as the reluctance with which he
accepted the present of a crown of gold, convinced the citizens of their
hopeless condition, the advocate Sylvanus was provoked to exclaim, "O
emperor! may you thus be crowned by all the cities of your dominions!"
Jovian, who in a few weeks had assumed the habits of a prince, [124] was
displeased with freedom, and offended with truth: and as he reasonably
supposed, that the discontent of the people might incline them to submit
to the Persian government, he published an edict, under pain of death,
that they should leave the city within the term of three days. Ammianus
has delineated in lively colors the scene of universal despair, which he
seems to have viewed with an eye of compassion. [125] The martial youth
deserted, with indignant grief, the walls which they had so gloriously
defended: the disconsolate mourner dropped a last tear over the tomb
of a son or husband, which must soon be profaned by the rude hand of a
Barbarian master; and the aged citizen kissed the threshold, and clung
to the doors, of the house where he had passed the cheerful and careless
hours of infancy. The highways were crowded with a trembling multitude:
the distinctions of rank, and sex, and age, were lost in the general
calamity. Every one strove to bear away some fragment from the wreck of
his fortunes; and as they could not command the immediate service of an
adequate number of horses or wagons, they were obliged to leave
behind them the greatest part of their valuable effects. The savage
insensibility of Jovian appears to have aggravated the hardships of
these unhappy fugitives. They were seated, however, in a new-built
quarter of Amida; and that rising city, with the reenforcement of a very
considerable colony, soon recovered its former splendor, and became
the capital of Mesopotamia. [126] Similar orders were despatched by the
emperor for the evacuation of Singara and the castle of the Moors;
and for the restitution of the five provinces beyond the Tigris. Sapor
enjoyed the glory and the fruits of his victory; and this ignominious
peace has justly been considered as a memorable aera in the decline
and fall of the Roman empire. The predecessors of Jovian had sometimes
relinquished the dominion of distant and unprofitable provinces; but,
since the foundation of the city, the genius of Rome, the god Terminus,
who guarded the boundaries of the republic, had never retired before the
sword of a victorious enemy. [127]

[Footnote 124: At Nisibis he performed a royal act. A brave officer, his
namesake, who had been thought worthy of the purple, was dragged from
supper, thrown into a well, and stoned to death without any form of
trial or evidence of guilt. Anomian. xxv. 8.]

[Footnote 125: See xxv. 9, and Zosimus, l. iii. p. 194, 195.]

[Footnote 126: Chron. Paschal. p. 300. The ecclesiastical Notitie may be
consulted.]

[Footnote 127: Zosimus, l. iii. p. 192, 193. Sextus Rufus de Provinciis,
c. 29. Augustin de Civitat. Dei, l. iv. c. 29. This general position
must be applied and interpreted with some caution.]

After Jovian had performed those engagements which the voice of his
people might have tempted him to violate, he hastened away from the
scene of his disgrace, and proceeded with his whole court to enjoy the
luxury of Antioch. [128] Without consulting the dictates of religious
zeal, he was prompted, by humanity and gratitude, to bestow the last
honors on the remains of his deceased sovereign: [129] and Procopius,
who sincerely bewailed the loss of his kinsman, was removed from
the command of the army, under the decent pretence of conducting the
funeral. The corpse of Julian was transported from Nisibis to Tarsus,
in a slow march of fifteen days; and, as it passed through the cities
of the East, was saluted by the hostile factions, with mournful
lamentations and clamorous insults. The Pagans already placed their
beloved hero in the rank of those gods whose worship he had restored;
while the invectives of the Christians pursued the soul of the Apostate
to hell, and his body to the grave. [130] One party lamented the
approaching ruin of their altars; the other celebrated the marvellous
deliverance of their church. The Christians applauded, in lofty and
ambiguous strains, the stroke of divine vengeance, which had been so
long suspended over the guilty head of Julian. They acknowledge, that
the death of the tyrant, at the instant he expired beyond the Tigris,
was revealed to the saints of Egypt, Syria, and Cappadocia; [131]
and instead of suffering him to fall by the Persian darts, their
indiscretion ascribed the heroic deed to the obscure hand of some mortal
or immortal champion of the faith. [132] Such imprudent declarations
were eagerly adopted by the malice, or credulity, of their adversaries;
[133] who darkly insinuated, or confidently asserted, that the governors
of the church had instigated and directed the fanaticism of a domestic
assassin. [134] Above sixteen years after the death of Julian, the
charge was solemnly and vehemently urged, in a public oration, addressed
by Libanius to the emperor Theodosius. His suspicions are unsupported
by fact or argument; and we can only esteem the generous zeal of the
sophist of Antioch for the cold and neglected ashes of his friend. [135]

[Footnote 128: Ammianus, xxv. 9. Zosimus, l. iii. p. 196. He might be
edax, vino Venerique indulgens. But I agree with La Bleterie (tom. i.
p. 148-154) in rejecting the foolish report of a Bacchanalian riot (ap.
Suidam) celebrated at Antioch, by the emperor, his wife, and a troop of
concubines.]

[Footnote 129: The Abbe de la Bleterie (tom. i. p. 156-209) handsomely
exposes the brutal bigotry of Baronius, who would have thrown Julian to
the dogs, ne cespititia quidem sepultura dignus.]

[Footnote 130: Compare the sophist and the saint, (Libanius, Monod.
tom. ii. p. 251, and Orat. Parent. c. 145, p. 367, c. 156, p. 377, with
Gregory Nazianzen, Orat. iv. p. 125-132.) The Christian orator faintly
mutters some exhortations to modesty and forgiveness; but he is well
satisfied, that the real sufferings of Julian will far exceed the
fabulous torments of Ixion or Tantalus.]

[Footnote 131: Tillemont (Hist. des Empereurs, tom. iv. p. 549) has
collected these visions. Some saint or angel was observed to be absent
in the night, on a secret expedition, &c.]

[Footnote 132: Sozomen (l. vi. 2) applauds the Greek doctrine
of tyrannicide; but the whole passage, which a Jesuit might have
translated, is prudently suppressed by the president Cousin.]

[Footnote 133: Immediately after the death of Julian, an uncertain rumor
was scattered, telo cecidisse Romano. It was carried, by some deserters
to the Persian camp; and the Romans were reproached as the assassins
of the emperor by Sapor and his subjects, (Ammian. xxv. 6. Libanius
de ulciscenda Juliani nece, c. xiii. p. 162, 163.) It was urged, as
a decisive proof, that no Persian had appeared to claim the promised
reward, (Liban. Orat. Parent. c. 141, p. 363.) But the flying horseman,
who darted the fatal javelin, might be ignorant of its effect; or he
might be slain in the same action. Ammianus neither feels nor inspires a
suspicion.]

[Footnote 134: This dark and ambiguous expression may point to
Athanasius, the first, without a rival, of the Christian clergy,
(Libanius de ulcis. Jul. nece, c. 5, p. 149. La Bleterie, Hist. de
Jovien, tom. i. p. 179.)]

[Footnote 135: The orator (Fabricius, Bibliot. Graec. tom. vii. p.
145-179) scatters suspicions, demands an inquiry, and insinuates, that
proofs might still be obtained. He ascribes the success of the Huns to
the criminal neglect of revenging Julian's death.]

It was an ancient custom in the funerals, as well as in the triumphs,
of the Romans, that the voice of praise should be corrected by that of
satire and ridicule; and that, in the midst of the splendid pageants,
which displayed the glory of the living or of the dead, their
imperfections should not be concealed from the eyes of the world. [136]
This custom was practised in the funeral of Julian. The comedians, who
resented his contempt and aversion for the theatre, exhibited, with
the applause of a Christian audience, the lively and exaggerated
representation of the faults and follies of the deceased emperor. His
various character and singular manners afforded an ample scope for
pleasantry and ridicule. [137] In the exercise of his uncommon talents,
he often descended below the majesty of his rank. Alexander was
transformed into Diogenes; the philosopher was degraded into a
priest. The purity of his virtue was sullied by excessive vanity; his
superstition disturbed the peace, and endangered the safety, of a mighty
empire; and his irregular sallies were the less entitled to indulgence,
as they appeared to be the laborious efforts of art, or even of
affectation. The remains of Julian were interred at Tarsus in Cilicia;
but his stately tomb, which arose in that city, on the banks of the cold
and limpid Cydnus, [138] was displeasing to the faithful friends, who
loved and revered the memory of that extraordinary man. The philosopher
expressed a very reasonable wish, that the disciple of Plato might
have reposed amidst the groves of the academy; [139] while the soldier
exclaimed, in bolder accents, that the ashes of Julian should have
been mingled with those of Caesar, in the field of Mars, and among the
ancient monuments of Roman virtue. [140] The history of princes does not
very frequently renew the examples of a similar competition.

[Footnote 136: At the funeral of Vespasian, the comedian who personated
that frugal emperor, anxiously inquired how much it cost. Fourscore
thousand pounds, (centies.) Give me the tenth part of the sum, and throw
my body into the Tiber. Sueton, in Vespasian, c. 19, with the notes of
Casaubon and Gronovius.]

[Footnote 137: Gregory (Orat. iv. p. 119, 120) compares this supposed
ignominy and ridicule to the funeral honors of Constantius, whose body
was chanted over Mount Taurus by a choir of angels.]

[Footnote 138: Quintus Curtius, l. iii. c. 4. The luxuriancy of his
descriptions has been often censured. Yet it was almost the duty of the
historian to describe a river, whose waters had nearly proved fatal to
Alexander.]

[Footnote 139: Libanius, Orat. Parent. c. 156, p. 377. Yet he
acknowledges with gratitude the liberality of the two royal brothers in
decorating the tomb of Julian, (de ulcis. Jul. nece, c. 7, p. 152.)]

[Footnote 140: Cujus suprema et cineres, si qui tunc juste consuleret,
non Cydnus videre deberet, quamvis gratissimus amnis et liquidus: sed ad
perpetuandam gloriam recte factorum praeterlambere Tiberis, intersecans
urbem aeternam, divorumque veterum monumenta praestringens Ammian. xxv.
10.]
