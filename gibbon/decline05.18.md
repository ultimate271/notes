## Chapter LI: Conquests By The Arabs.--Part IV.

Syria, [67] one of the countries that have been improved by the most
early cultivation, is not unworthy of the preference. [68] The heat of
the climate is tempered by the vicinity of the sea and mountains, by the
plenty of wood and water; and the produce of a fertile soil affords the
subsistence, and encourages the propagation, of men and animals. From
the age of David to that of Heraclius, the country was overspread
with ancient and flourishing cities: the inhabitants were numerous and
wealthy; and, after the slow ravage of despotism and superstition, after
the recent calamities of the Persian war, Syria could still attract
and reward the rapacious tribes of the desert. A plain, of ten days'
journey, from Damascus to Aleppo and Antioch, is watered, on the western
side, by the winding course of the Orontes. The hills of Libanus and
Anti-Libanus are planted from north to south, between the Orontes and
the Mediterranean; and the epithet of hollow (Coelesyria) was applied to
a long and fruitful valley, which is confined in the same direction,
by the two ridges of snowy mountains. [69] Among the cities, which are
enumerated by Greek and Oriental names in the geography and conquest
of Syria, we may distinguish Emesa or Hems, Heliopolis or Baalbec, the
former as the metropolis of the plain, the latter as the capital of the
valley. Under the last of the Caesars, they were strong and populous;
the turrets glittered from afar: an ample space was covered with public
and private buildings; and the citizens were illustrious by their
spirit, or at least by their pride; by their riches, or at least by
their luxury. In the days of Paganism, both Emesa and Heliopolis were
addicted to the worship of Baal, or the sun; but the decline of their
superstition and splendor has been marked by a singular variety of
fortune. Not a vestige remains of the temple of Emesa, which was
equalled in poetic style to the summits of Mount Libanus, [70] while
the ruins of Baalbec, invisible to the writers of antiquity, excite the
curiosity and wonder of the European traveller. [71] The measure of the
temple is two hundred feet in length, and one hundred in breadth: the
front is adorned with a double portico of eight columns; fourteen may be
counted on either side; and each column, forty-five feet in height, is
composed of three massy blocks of stone or marble. The proportions
and ornaments of the Corinthian order express the architecture of the
Greeks: but as Baalbec has never been the seat of a monarch, we are at
a loss to conceive how the expense of these magnificent structures could
be supplied by private or municipal liberality. [72] From the conquest
of Damascus the Saracens proceeded to Heliopolis and Emesa: but I
shall decline the repetition of the sallies and combats which have been
already shown on a larger scale. In the prosecution of the war, their
policy was not less effectual than their sword. By short and separate
truces they dissolved the union of the enemy; accustomed the Syrians
to compare their friendship with their enmity; familiarized the idea
of their language, religion, and manners; and exhausted, by clandestine
purchase, the magazines and arsenals of the cities which they returned
to besiege. They aggravated the ransom of the more wealthy, or the more
obstinate; and Chalcis alone was taxed at five thousand ounces of gold,
five thousand ounces of silver, two thousand robes of silk, and as many
figs and olives as would load five thousand asses. But the terms of
truce or capitulation were faithfully observed; and the lieutenant
of the caliph, who had promised not to enter the walls of the captive
Baalbec, remained tranquil and immovable in his tent till the jarring
factions solicited the interposition of a foreign master. The conquest
of the plain and valley of Syria was achieved in less than two years.
Yet the commander of the faithful reproved the slowness of their
progress; and the Saracens, bewailing their fault with tears of rage and
repentance, called aloud on their chiefs to lead them forth to fight the
battles of the Lord. In a recent action, under the walls of Emesa,
an Arabian youth, the cousin of Caled, was heard aloud to exclaim,
"Methinks I see the black-eyed girls looking upon me; one of whom,
should she appear in this world, all mankind would die for love of her.
And I see in the hand of one of them a handkerchief of green silk, and
a cap of precious stones, and she beckons me, and calls out, Come hither
quickly, for I love thee." With these words, charging the Christians, he
made havoc wherever he went, till, observed at length by the governor of
Hems, he was struck through with a javelin.

[Footnote 67: In the Geography of Abulfeda, the description of Syria,
his native country, is the most interesting and authentic portion. It
was published in Arabic and Latin, Lipsiae, 1766, in quarto, with the
learned notes of Kochler and Reiske, and some extracts of geography and
natural history from Ibn Ol Wardii. Among the modern travels, Pocock's
Description of the East (of Syria and Mesopotamia, vol. ii. p. 88-209)
is a work of superior learning and dignity; but the author too often
confounds what he had seen and what he had read.]

[Footnote 68: The praises of Dionysius are just and lively. Syria, (in
Periegesi, v. 902, in tom. iv. Geograph. Minor. Hudson.) In another
place he styles the country differently, (v. 898.) This poetical
geographer lived in the age of Augustus, and his description of the
world is illustrated by the Greek commentary of Eustathius, who paid the
same compliment to Homer and Dionysius, (Fabric. Bibliot. Graec. l. iv.
c. 2, tom. iii. p. 21, &c.)]

[Footnote 69: The topography of the Libanus and Anti-Libanus is
excellently described by the learning and sense of Reland, (Palestin.
tom. i. p. 311-326)]

[Footnote 70:

 --Emesae fastigia celsa renident.
   Nam diffusa solo latus explicat; ac subit auras
   Turribus in coelum nitentibus: incola claris
   Cor studiis acuit...
   Denique flammicomo devoti pectora soli
   Vitam agitant.  Libanus frondosa cacumina turget.
   Et tamen his certant celsi fastigia templi.

These verses of the Latin version of Rufus Avienus are wanting in the
Greek original of Dionysius; and since they are likewise unnoticed by
Eustathius, I must, with Fabricius, (Bibliot. Latin. tom. iii. p. 153,
edit. Ernesti,) and against Salmasius, (ad Vopiscum, p. 366, 367, in
Hist. August.,) ascribed them to the fancy, rather than the Mss., of
Avienus.]

[Footnote 71: I am much better satisfied with Maundrell's slight octavo,
(Journey, p. 134-139), than with the pompous folio of Dr. Pocock,
(Description of the East, vol. ii. p. 106-113;) but every preceding
account is eclipsed by the magnificent description and drawings of Mm.
Dawkins and Wood, who have transported into England the ruins of Pamyra
and Baalbec.]

[Footnote 72: The Orientals explain the prodigy by a never-failing
expedient. The edifices of Baalbec were constructed by the fairies or
the genii, (Hist. de Timour Bec, tom. iii. l. v. c. 23, p. 311, 312.
Voyage d'Otter, tom. i. p. 83.) With less absurdity, but with equal
ignorance, Abulfeda and Ibn Chaukel ascribe them to the Sabaeans or
Aadites Non sunt in omni Syria aedificia magnificentiora his, (Tabula
Syria p. 108.)]

It was incumbent on the Saracens to exert the full powers of their valor
and enthusiasm against the forces of the emperor, who was taught, by
repeated losses, that the rovers of the desert had undertaken, and would
speedily achieve, a regular and permanent conquest. From the provinces
of Europe and Asia, fourscore thousand soldiers were transported by sea
and land to Antioch and Caesarea: the light troops of the army consisted
of sixty thousand Christian Arabs of the tribe of Gassan. Under the
banner of Jabalah, the last of their princes, they marched in the
van; and it was a maxim of the Greeks, that for the purpose of cutting
diamond, a diamond was the most effectual. Heraclius withheld his person
from the dangers of the field; but his presumption, or perhaps his
despondency, suggested a peremptory order, that the fate of the province
and the war should be decided by a single battle. The Syrians were
attached to the standard of Rome and of the cross: but the noble, the
citizen, the peasant, were exasperated by the injustice and cruelty of
a licentious host, who oppressed them as subjects, and despised them
as strangers and aliens. [73] A report of these mighty preparations was
conveyed to the Saracens in their camp of Emesa, and the chiefs, though
resolved to fight, assembled a council: the faith of Abu Obeidah would
have expected on the same spot the glory of martyrdom; the wisdom
of Caled advised an honorable retreat to the skirts of Palestine and
Arabia, where they might await the succors of their friends, and the
attack of the unbelievers. A speedy messenger soon returned from the
throne of Medina, with the blessings of Omar and Ali, the prayers of the
widows of the prophet, and a reenforcement of eight thousand Moslems. In
their way they overturned a detachment of Greeks, and when they
joined at Yermuk the camp of their brethren, they found the pleasing
intelligence, that Caled had already defeated and scattered the
Christian Arabs of the tribe of Gassan. In the neighborhood of Bosra,
the springs of Mount Hermon descend in a torrent to the plain of
Decapolis, or ten cities; and the Hieromax, a name which has been
corrupted to Yermuk, is lost, after a short course, in the Lake of
Tiberias. [74] The banks of this obscure stream were illustrated by a
long and bloody encounter. [7411] On this momentous occasion, the public
voice, and the modesty of Abu Obeidah, restored the command to the most
deserving of the Moslems. Caled assumed his station in the front, his
colleague was posted in the rear, that the disorder of the fugitive
might be checked by his venerable aspect, and the sight of the yellow
banner which Mahomet had displayed before the walls of Chaibar. The last
line was occupied by the sister of Derar, with the Arabian women who had
enlisted in this holy war, who were accustomed to wield the bow and
the lance, and who in a moment of captivity had defended, against
the uncircumcised ravishers, their chastity and religion. [75] The
exhortation of the generals was brief and forcible: "Paradise is before
you, the devil and hell-fire in your rear." Yet such was the weight
of the Roman cavalry, that the right wing of the Arabs was broken and
separated from the main body. Thrice did they retreat in disorder, and
thrice were they driven back to the charge by the reproaches and blows
of the women. In the intervals of action, Abu Obeidah visited the tents
of his brethren, prolonged their repose by repeating at once the prayers
of two different hours, bound up their wounds with his own hands, and
administered the comfortable reflection, that the infidels partook of
their sufferings without partaking of their reward. Four thousand and
thirty of the Moslems were buried in the field of battle; and the skill
of the Armenian archers enabled seven hundred to boast that they had
lost an eye in that meritorious service. The veterans of the Syrian war
acknowledged that it was the hardest and most doubtful of the days which
they had seen. But it was likewise the most decisive: many thousands
of the Greeks and Syrians fell by the swords of the Arabs; many were
slaughtered, after the defeat, in the woods and mountains; many, by
mistaking the ford, were drowned in the waters of the Yermuk; and
however the loss may be magnified, [76] the Christian writers confess
and bewail the bloody punishment of their sins. [77] Manuel, the Roman
general, was either killed at Damascus, or took refuge in the monastery
of Mount Sinai. An exile in the Byzantine court, Jabalah lamented the
manners of Arabia, and his unlucky preference of the Christian cause.
[78] He had once inclined to the profession of Islam; but in the
pilgrimage of Mecca, Jabalah was provoked to strike one of his brethren,
and fled with amazement from the stern and equal justice of the caliph
These victorious Saracens enjoyed at Damascus a month of pleasure and
repose: the spoil was divided by the discretion of Abu Obeidah: an equal
share was allotted to a soldier and to his horse, and a double portion
was reserved for the noble coursers of the Arabian breed.

[Footnote 73: I have read somewhere in Tacitus, or Grotius, Subjectos
habent tanquam suos, viles tanquam alienos. Some Greek officers ravished
the wife, and murdered the child, of their Syrian landlord; and Manuel
smiled at his undutiful complaint.]

[Footnote 74: See Reland, Palestin. tom. i. p. 272, 283, tom. ii. p.
773, 775. This learned professor was equal to the task of describing
the Holy Land, since he was alike conversant with Greek and Latin, with
Hebrew and Arabian literature. The Yermuk, or Hieromax, is noticed by
Cellarius (Geograph. Antiq. tom. ii. p. 392) and D'Anville, (Geographie
Ancienne, tom. ii. p. 185.) The Arabs, and even Abulfeda himself, do not
seem to recognize the scene of their victory.]

[Footnote 7411: Compare Price, p. 79. The army of the Romans is swoller
to 400,000 men of which 70,000 perished.--M.]

[Footnote 75: These women were of the tribe of the Hamyarites, who
derived their origin from the ancient Amalekites. Their females were
accustomed to ride on horseback, and to fight like the Amazons of old,
(Ockley, vol. i. p. 67.)]

[Footnote 76: We killed of them, says Abu Obeidah to the caliph, one
hundred and fifty thousand, and made prisoners forty thousand, (Ockley
vol. i. p. 241.) As I cannot doubt his veracity, nor believe his
computation, I must suspect that the Arabic historians indulge
themselves in the practice of comparing speeches and letters for their
heroes.]

[Footnote 77: After deploring the sins of the Christians, Theophanes,
adds, (Chronograph. p. 276,) does he mean Aiznadin? His account is brief
and obscure, but he accuses the numbers of the enemy, the adverse wind,
and the cloud of dust. (Chronograph. p. 280.)]

[Footnote 78: See Abulfeda, (Annal. Moslem. p. 70, 71,) who transcribes
the poetical complaint of Jabalah himself, and some panegyrical strains
of an Arabian poet, to whom the chief of Gassan sent from Constantinople
a gift of five hundred pieces of gold by the hands of the ambassador of
Omar.]

After the battle of Yermuk, the Roman army no longer appeared in the
field; and the Saracens might securely choose, among the fortified towns
of Syria, the first object of their attack. They consulted the caliph
whether they should march to Caesarea or Jerusalem; and the advice of
Ali determined the immediate siege of the latter. To a profane eye,
Jerusalem was the first or second capital of Palestine; but after Mecca
and Medina, it was revered and visited by the devout Moslems, as the
temple of the Holy Land which had been sanctified by the revelation of
Moses, of Jesus, and of Mahomet himself. The son of Abu Sophian was
sent with five thousand Arabs to try the first experiment of surprise
or treaty; but on the eleventh day, the town was invested by the whole
force of Abu Obeidah. He addressed the customary summons to the chief
commanders and people of Aelia. [79]

[Footnote 79: In the name of the city, the profane prevailed over the
sacred Jerusalem was known to the devout Christians, (Euseb. de Martyr
Palest. c xi.;) but the legal and popular appellation of Aelia (the
colony of Aelius Hadrianus) has passed from the Romans to the Arabs.
(Reland, Palestin. tom. i. p. 207, tom. ii. p. 835. D'Herbelot,
Bibliotheque Orientale, Cods, p. 269, Ilia, p. 420.) The epithet of Al
Cods, the Holy, is used as the proper name of Jerusalem.]

"Health and happiness to every one that follows the right way! We
require of you to testify that there is but one God, and that Mahomet is
his apostle. If you refuse this, consent to pay tribute, and be under us
forthwith. Otherwise I shall bring men against you who love death better
than you do the drinking of wine or eating hog's flesh. Nor will I ever
stir from you, if it please God, till I have destroyed those that fight
for you, and made slaves of your children." But the city was defended
on every side by deep valleys and steep ascents; since the invasion of
Syria, the walls and towers had been anxiously restored; the bravest of
the fugitives of Yermuk had stopped in the nearest place of refuge; and
in the defence of the sepulchre of Christ, the natives and strangers
might feel some sparks of the enthusiasm, which so fiercely glowed in
the bosoms of the Saracens. The siege of Jerusalem lasted four months;
not a day was lost without some action of sally or assault; the military
engines incessantly played from the ramparts; and the inclemency of
the winter was still more painful and destructive to the Arabs. The
Christians yielded at length to the perseverance of the besiegers.
The patriarch Sophronius appeared on the walls, and by the voice of
an interpreter demanded a conference. [7911] After a vain attempt to
dissuade the lieutenant of the caliph from his impious enterprise, he
proposed, in the name of the people, a fair capitulation, with this
extraordinary clause, that the articles of security should be ratified
by the authority and presence of Omar himself. The question was debated
in the council of Medina; the sanctity of the place, and the advice
of Ali, persuaded the caliph to gratify the wishes of his soldiers and
enemies; and the simplicity of his journey is more illustrious than the
royal pageants of vanity and oppression. The conqueror of Persia and
Syria was mounted on a red camel, which carried, besides his person,
a bag of corn, a bag of dates, a wooden dish, and a leathern bottle of
water. Wherever he halted, the company, without distinction, was invited
to partake of his homely fare, and the repast was consecrated by the
prayer and exhortation of the commander of the faithful. [80] But
in this expedition or pilgrimage, his power was exercised in the
administration of justice: he reformed the licentious polygamy of
the Arabs, relieved the tributaries from extortion and cruelty, and
chastised the luxury of the Saracens, by despoiling them of their rich
silks, and dragging them on their faces in the dirt. When he came
within sight of Jerusalem, the caliph cried with a loud voice, "God is
victorious. O Lord, give us an easy conquest!" and, pitching his tent
of coarse hair, calmly seated himself on the ground. After signing
the capitulation, he entered the city without fear or precaution; and
courteously discoursed with the patriarch concerning its religious
antiquities. [81] Sophronius bowed before his new master, and secretly
muttered, in the words of Daniel, "The abomination of desolation is in
the holy place." [82] At the hour of prayer they stood together in
the church of the resurrection; but the caliph refused to perform his
devotions, and contented himself with praying on the steps of the church
of Constantine. To the patriarch he disclosed his prudent and honorable
motive. "Had I yielded," said Omar, "to your request, the Moslems of a
future age would have infringed the treaty under color of imitating
my example." By his command the ground of the temple of Solomon was
prepared for the foundation of a mosch; [83] and, during a residence
of ten days, he regulated the present and future state of his Syrian
conquests. Medina might be jealous, lest the caliph should be
detained by the sanctity of Jerusalem or the beauty of Damascus; her
apprehensions were dispelled by his prompt and voluntary return to the
tomb of the apostle. [84]

[Footnote 7911: See the explanation of this in Price, with the prophecy
which was hereby fulfilled, p 85.--M]

[Footnote 80: The singular journey and equipage of Omar are described
(besides Ockley, vol. i. p. 250) by Murtadi, (Merveilles de l'Egypte, p.
200-202.)]

[Footnote 81: The Arabs boast of an old prophecy preserved at Jerusalem,
and describing the name, the religion, and the person of Omar, the
future conqueror. By such arts the Jews are said to have soothed the
pride of their foreign masters, Cyrus and Alexander, (Joseph. Ant. Jud.
l. xi c. 1, 8, p. 447, 579-582.)]

[Footnote 82: Theophan. Chronograph. p. 281. This prediction, which had
already served for Antiochus and the Romans, was again refitted for
the present occasion, by the economy of Sophronius, one of the deepest
theologians of the Monothelite controversy.]

[Footnote 83: According to the accurate survey of D'Anville,
(Dissertation sun l'ancienne Jerusalem, p. 42-54,) the mosch of Omar,
enlarged and embellished by succeeding caliphs, covered the ground of
the ancient temple, (says Phocas,) a length of 215, a breadth of 172,
toises. The Nubian geographer declares, that this magnificent structure
was second only in size and beauty to the great mosch of Cordova, (p.
113,) whose present state Mr. Swinburne has so elegantly represented,
(Travels into Spain, p. 296-302.)]

[Footnote 84: Of the many Arabic tarikhs or chronicles of Jerusalem,
(D'Herbelot, p. 867,) Ockley found one among the Pocock Mss. of Oxford,
(vol. i. p. 257,) which he has used to supply the defective narrative of
Al Wakidi.]

To achieve what yet remained of the Syrian war the caliph had formed two
separate armies; a chosen detachment, under Amrou and Yezid, was left in
the camp of Palestine; while the larger division, under the standard
of Abu Obeidah and Caled, marched away to the north against Antioch
and Aleppo. The latter of these, the Beraea of the Greeks, was not
yet illustrious as the capital of a province or a kingdom; and the
inhabitants, by anticipating their submission and pleading their
poverty, obtained a moderate composition for their lives and religion.
But the castle of Aleppo, [85] distinct from the city, stood erect on
a lofty artificial mound the sides were sharpened to a precipice, and
faced with free-stone; and the breadth of the ditch might be filled with
water from the neighboring springs. After the loss of three thousand
men, the garrison was still equal to the defence; and Youkinna, their
valiant and hereditary chief, had murdered his brother, a holy monk,
for daring to pronounce the name of peace. In a siege of four or five
months, the hardest of the Syrian war, great numbers of the Saracens
were killed and wounded: their removal to the distance of a mile could
not seduce the vigilance of Youkinna; nor could the Christians be
terrified by the execution of three hundred captives, whom they beheaded
before the castle wall. The silence, and at length the complaints,
of Abu Obeidah informed the caliph that their hope and patience were
consumed at the foot of this impregnable fortress. "I am variously
affected," replied Omar, "by the difference of your success; but I
charge you by no means to raise the siege of the castle. Your retreat
would diminish the reputation of our arms, and encourage the infidels
to fall upon you on all sides. Remain before Aleppo till God shall
determine the event, and forage with your horse round the adjacent
country." The exhortation of the commander of the faithful was fortified
by a supply of volunteers from all the tribes of Arabia, who arrived in
the camp on horses or camels. Among these was Dames, of a servile birth,
but of gigantic size and intrepid resolution. The forty-seventh day of
his service he proposed, with only thirty men, to make an attempt on the
castle. The experience and testimony of Caled recommended his offer; and
Abu Obeidah admonished his brethren not to despise the baser origin
of Dames, since he himself, could he relinquish the public care, would
cheerfully serve under the banner of the slave. His design was covered
by the appearance of a retreat; and the camp of the Saracens was pitched
about a league from Aleppo. The thirty adventurers lay in ambush at the
foot of the hill; and Dames at length succeeded in his inquiries, though
he was provoked by the ignorance of his Greek captives. "God curse these
dogs," said the illiterate Arab; "what a strange barbarous language they
speak!" At the darkest hour of the night, he scaled the most accessible
height, which he had diligently surveyed, a place where the stones
were less entire, or the slope less perpendicular, or the guard less
vigilant. Seven of the stoutest Saracens mounted on each other's
shoulders, and the weight of the column was sustained on the broad and
sinewy back of the gigantic slave. The foremost in this painful ascent
could grasp and climb the lowest part of the battlements; they silently
stabbed and cast down the sentinels; and the thirty brethren, repeating
a pious ejaculation, "O apostle of God, help and deliver us!" were
successively drawn up by the long folds of their turbans. With bold
and cautious footsteps, Dames explored the palace of the governor, who
celebrated, in riotous merriment, the festival of his deliverance. From
thence, returning to his companions, he assaulted on the inside the
entrance of the castle. They overpowered the guard, unbolted the gate,
let down the drawbridge, and defended the narrow pass, till the arrival
of Caled, with the dawn of day, relieved their danger and assured
their conquest. Youkinna, a formidable foe, became an active and useful
proselyte; and the general of the Saracens expressed his regard for the
most humble merit, by detaining the army at Aleppo till Dames was cured
of his honorable wounds. The capital of Syria was still covered by the
castle of Aazaz and the iron bridge of the Orontes. After the loss of
those important posts, and the defeat of the last of the Roman armies,
the luxury of Antioch [86] trembled and obeyed. Her safety was ransomed
with three hundred thousand pieces of gold; but the throne of the
successors of Alexander, the seat of the Roman government of the East,
which had been decorated by Caesar with the titles of free, and
holy, and inviolate was degraded under the yoke of the caliphs to the
secondary rank of a provincial town. [87]

[Footnote 85: The Persian historian of Timur (tom. iii. l. v. c. 21,
p. 300) describes the castle of Aleppo as founded on a rock one hundred
cubits in height; a proof, says the French translator, that he had never
visited the place. It is now in the midst of the city, of no strength
with a single gate; the circuit is about 500 or 600 paces, and the
ditch half full of stagnant water, (Voyages de Tavernier, tom. i. p.
149 Pocock, vol. ii. part i. p. 150.) The fortresses of the East are
contemptible to a European eye.]

[Footnote 86: The date of the conquest of Antioch by the Arabs is of
some importance. By comparing the years of the world in the chronography
of Theophanes with the years of the Hegira in the history of Elmacin, we
shall determine, that it was taken between January 23d and September 1st
of the year of Christ 638, (Pagi, Critica, in Baron. Annal. tom. ii.
p. 812, 813.) Al Wakidi (Ockley, vol. i. p. 314) assigns that event to
Tuesday, August 21st, an inconsistent date; since Easter fell that
year on April 5th, the 21st of August must have been a Friday, (see the
Tables of the Art de Verifier les Dates.)]

[Footnote 87: His bounteous edict, which tempted the grateful city to
assume the victory of Pharsalia for a perpetual aera, is given. John
Malala, in Chron. p. 91, edit. Venet. We may distinguish his authentic
information of domestic facts from his gross ignorance of general
history.]

In the life of Heraclius, the glories of the Persian war are clouded on
either hand by the disgrace and weakness of his more early and his later
days. When the successors of Mahomet unsheathed the sword of war and
religion, he was astonished at the boundless prospect of toil and
danger; his nature was indolent, nor could the infirm and frigid age of
the emperor be kindled to a second effort. The sense of shame, and the
importunities of the Syrians, prevented the hasty departure from the
scene of action; but the hero was no more; and the loss of Damascus and
Jerusalem, the bloody fields of Aiznadin and Yermuk, may be imputed in
some degree to the absence or misconduct of the sovereign. Instead of
defending the sepulchre of Christ, he involved the church and state in a
metaphysical controversy for the unity of his will; and while Heraclius
crowned the offspring of his second nuptials, he was tamely stripped
of the most valuable part of their inheritance. In the cathedral of
Antioch, in the presence of the bishops, at the foot of the crucifix,
he bewailed the sins of the prince and people; but his confession
instructed the world, that it was vain, and perhaps impious, to resist
the judgment of God. The Saracens were invincible in fact, since they
were invincible in opinion; and the desertion of Youkinna, his false
repentance and repeated perfidy, might justify the suspicion of
the emperor, that he was encompassed by traitors and apostates, who
conspired to betray his person and their country to the enemies of
Christ. In the hour of adversity, his superstition was agitated by
the omens and dreams of a falling crown; and after bidding an eternal
farewell to Syria, he secretly embarked with a few attendants, and
absolved the faith of his subjects. [88] Constantine, his eldest son,
had been stationed with forty thousand men at Caesarea, the civil
metropolis of the three provinces of Palestine. But his private interest
recalled him to the Byzantine court; and, after the flight of his
father, he felt himself an unequal champion to the united force of the
caliph. His vanguard was boldly attacked by three hundred Arabs and
a thousand black slaves, who, in the depth of winter, had climbed
the snowy mountains of Libanus, and who were speedily followed by the
victorious squadrons of Caled himself. From the north and south the
troops of Antioch and Jerusalem advanced along the sea-shore till their
banners were joined under the walls of the Phoenician cities: Tripoli
and Tyre were betrayed; and a fleet of fifty transports, which entered
without distrust the captive harbors, brought a seasonable supply of
arms and provisions to the camp of the Saracens. Their labors were
terminated by the unexpected surrender of Caesarea: the Roman prince had
embarked in the night; [89] and the defenceless citizens solicited their
pardon with an offering of two hundred thousand pieces of gold.
The remainder of the province, Ramlah, Ptolemais or Acre, Sichem or
Neapolis, Gaza, Ascalon, Berytus, Sidon, Gabala, Laodicea, Apamea,
Hierapolis, no longer presumed to dispute the will of the conqueror; and
Syria bowed under the sceptre of the caliphs seven hundred years after
Pompey had despoiled the last of the Macedonian kings. [90]

[Footnote 88: See Ockley, (vol. i. p. 308, 312,) who laughs at the
credulity of his author. When Heraclius bade farewell to Syria, Vale
Syria et ultimum vale, he prophesied that the Romans should never
reenter the province till the birth of an inauspicious child, the future
scourge of the empire. Abulfeda, p. 68. I am perfectly ignorant of the
mystic sense, or nonsense, of this prediction.]

[Footnote 89: In the loose and obscure chronology of the times, I am
guided by an authentic record, (in the book of ceremonies of Constantine
Porphyrogenitus,) which certifies that, June 4, A.D. 638, the emperor
crowned his younger son Heraclius, in the presence of his eldest,
Constantine, and in the palace of Constantinople; that January 1, A.D.
639, the royal procession visited the great church, and on the 4th of
the same month, the hippodrome.]

[Footnote 90: Sixty-five years before Christ, Syria Pontusque monumenta
sunt Cn. Pompeii virtutis, (Vell. Patercul. ii. 38,) rather of his
fortune and power: he adjudged Syria to be a Roman province, and the
last of the Seleucides were incapable of drawing a sword in the defence
of their patrimony (see the original texts collected by Usher, Annal. p.
420)]
