## Chapter XLVI: Troubles In Persia.--Part II.

While the majesty of the Roman name was revived in the East, the
prospect of Europe is less pleasing and less glorious. By the departure
of the Lombards, and the ruin of the Gepidae, the balance of power was
destroyed on the Danube; and the Avars spread their permanent dominion
from the foot of the Alps to the sea-coast of the Euxine. The reign
of Baian is the brightest aera of their monarchy; their chagan, who
occupied the rustic palace of Attila, appears to have imitated his
character and policy; [23] but as the same scenes were repeated in a
smaller circle, a minute representation of the copy would be devoid
of the greatness and novelty of the original. The pride of the second
Justin, of Tiberius, and Maurice, was humbled by a proud Barbarian, more
prompt to inflict, than exposed to suffer, the injuries of war; and as
often as Asia was threatened by the Persian arms, Europe was oppressed
by the dangerous inroads, or costly friendship, of the Avars. When the
Roman envoys approached the presence of the chagan, they were commanded
to wait at the door of his tent, till, at the end perhaps of ten or
twelve days, he condescended to admit them. If the substance or the
style of their message was offensive to his ear, he insulted, with real
or affected fury, their own dignity, and that of their prince; their
baggage was plundered, and their lives were only saved by the promise
of a richer present and a more respectful address. But his sacred
ambassadors enjoyed and abused an unbounded license in the midst of
Constantinople: they urged, with importunate clamors, the increase of
tribute, or the restitution of captives and deserters: and the majesty
of the empire was almost equally degraded by a base compliance, or
by the false and fearful excuses with which they eluded such insolent
demands. The chagan had never seen an elephant; and his curiosity was
excited by the strange, and perhaps fabulous, portrait of that wonderful
animal. At his command, one of the largest elephants of the Imperial
stables was equipped with stately caparisons, and conducted by a
numerous train to the royal village in the plains of Hungary. He
surveyed the enormous beast with surprise, with disgust, and possibly
with terror; and smiled at the vain industry of the Romans, who, in
search of such useless rarities, could explore the limits of the land
and sea. He wished, at the expense of the emperor, to repose in a golden
bed. The wealth of Constantinople, and the skilful diligence of her
artists, were instantly devoted to the gratification of his caprice; but
when the work was finished, he rejected with scorn a present so unworthy
the majesty of a great king. [24] These were the casual sallies of his
pride; but the avarice of the chagan was a more steady and tractable
passion: a rich and regular supply of silk apparel, furniture, and
plate, introduced the rudiments of art and luxury among the tents of the
Scythians; their appetite was stimulated by the pepper and cinnamon of
India; [25] the annual subsidy or tribute was raised from fourscore to
one hundred and twenty thousand pieces of gold; and after each hostile
interruption, the payment of the arrears, with exorbitant interest, was
always made the first condition of the new treaty. In the language of a
Barbarian, without guile, the prince of the Avars affected to complain
of the insincerity of the Greeks; [26] yet he was not inferior to the
most civilized nations in the refinement of dissimulation and perfidy.
As the successor of the Lombards, the chagan asserted his claim to
the important city of Sirmium, the ancient bulwark of the Illyrian
provinces. [27] The plains of the Lower Hungary were covered with the
Avar horse and a fleet of large boats was built in the Hercynian wood,
to descend the Danube, and to transport into the Save the materials of
a bridge. But as the strong garrison of Singidunum, which commanded the
conflux of the two rivers, might have stopped their passage and baffled
his designs, he dispelled their apprehensions by a solemn oath that his
views were not hostile to the empire. He swore by his sword, the symbol
of the god of war, that he did not, as the enemy of Rome, construct
a bridge upon the Save. "If I violate my oath," pursued the intrepid
Baian, "may I myself, and the last of my nation, perish by the sword!
May the heavens, and fire, the deity of the heavens, fall upon our
heads! May the forests and mountains bury us in their ruins! and the
Save returning, against the laws of nature, to his source, overwhelm
us in his angry waters!" After this barbarous imprecation, he calmly
inquired, what oath was most sacred and venerable among the Christians,
what guilt or perjury it was most dangerous to incur. The bishop of
Singidunum presented the gospel, which the chagan received with devout
reverence. "I swear," said he, "by the God who has spoken in this holy
book, that I have neither falsehood on my tongue, nor treachery in my
heart." As soon as he rose from his knees, he accelerated the labor of
the bridge, and despatched an envoy to proclaim what he no longer wished
to conceal. "Inform the emperor," said the perfidious Baian, "that
Sirmium is invested on every side. Advise his prudence to withdraw
the citizens and their effects, and to resign a city which it is now
impossible to relieve or defend." Without the hope of relief, the
defence of Sirmium was prolonged above three years: the walls were still
untouched; but famine was enclosed within the walls, till a merciful
capitulation allowed the escape of the naked and hungry inhabitants.
Singidunum, at the distance of fifty miles, experienced a more cruel
fate: the buildings were razed, and the vanquished people was condemned
to servitude and exile. Yet the ruins of Sirmium are no longer visible;
the advantageous situation of Singidunum soon attracted a new colony of
Sclavonians, and the conflux of the Save and Danube is still guarded
by the fortifications of Belgrade, or the White City, so often and
so obstinately disputed by the Christian and Turkish arms. [28] From
Belgrade to the walls of Constantinople a line may be measured of six
hundred miles: that line was marked with flames and with blood; the
horses of the Avars were alternately bathed in the Euxine and the
Adriatic; and the Roman pontiff, alarmed by the approach of a more
savage enemy, [29] was reduced to cherish the Lombards, as the
protectors of Italy. The despair of a captive, whom his country refused
to ransom, disclosed to the Avars the invention and practice of military
engines. [30] But in the first attempts they were rudely framed, and
awkwardly managed; and the resistance of Diocletianopolis and Beraea, of
Philippopolis and Adrianople, soon exhausted the skill and patience of
the besiegers. The warfare of Baian was that of a Tartar; yet his mind
was susceptible of a humane and generous sentiment: he spared Anchialus,
whose salutary waters had restored the health of the best beloved of his
wives; and the Romans confessed, that their starving army was fed and
dismissed by the liberality of a foe. His empire extended over Hungary,
Poland, and Prussia, from the mouth of the Danube to that of the Oder;
[31] and his new subjects were divided and transplanted by the jealous
policy of the conqueror. [32] The eastern regions of Germany, which had
been left vacant by the emigration of the Vandals, were replenished with
Sclavonian colonists; the same tribes are discovered in the neighborhood
of the Adriatic and of the Baltic, and with the name of Baian himself,
the Illyrian cities of Neyss and Lissa are again found in the heart of
Silesia. In the disposition both of his troops and provinces the chagan
exposed the vassals, whose lives he disregarded, [33] to the first
assault; and the swords of the enemy were blunted before they
encountered the native valor of the Avars.

[Footnote 23: A general idea of the pride and power of the chagan may be
taken from Menander (Excerpt. Legat. p. 118, &c.) and Theophylact, (l.
i. c. 3, l. vii. c. 15,) whose eight books are much more honorable to
the Avar than to the Roman prince. The predecessors of Baian had tasted
the liberality of Rome, and he survived the reign of Maurice, (Buat,
Hist. des Peuples Barbares, tom. xi. p. 545.) The chagan who invaded
Italy, A.D. 611, (Muratori, Annali, tom. v. p. 305,) was then invenili
aetate florentem, (Paul Warnefrid, de Gest. Langobard. l v c 38,) the
son, perhaps, or the grandson, of Baian.]

The Persian alliance restored the troops of the East to the defence of
Europe: and Maurice, who had supported ten years the insolence of
the chagan, declared his resolution to march in person against the
Barbarians. In the space of two centuries, none of the successors of
Theodosius had appeared in the field: their lives were supinely spent in
the palace of Constantinople; and the Greeks could no longer understand,
that the name of emperor, in its primitive sense, denoted the chief of
the armies of the republic. The martial ardor of Maurice was opposed
by the grave flattery of the senate, the timid superstition of the
patriarch, and the tears of the empress Constantina; and they all
conjured him to devolve on some meaner general the fatigues and perils
of a Scythian campaign. Deaf to their advice and entreaty, the emperor
boldly advanced [34] seven miles from the capital; the sacred ensign
of the cross was displayed in the front; and Maurice reviewed, with
conscious pride, the arms and numbers of the veterans who had fought and
conquered beyond the Tigris. Anchialus was the last term of his progress
by sea and land; he solicited, without success, a miraculous answer
to his nocturnal prayers; his mind was confounded by the death of a
favorite horse, the encounter of a wild boar, a storm of wind and rain,
and the birth of a monstrous child; and he forgot that the best of omens
is to unsheathe our sword in the defence of our country. [35] Under the
pretence of receiving the ambassadors of Persia, the emperor returned to
Constantinople, exchanged the thoughts of war for those of devotion,
and disappointed the public hope by his absence and the choice of his
lieutenants. The blind partiality of fraternal love might excuse the
promotion of his brother Peter, who fled with equal disgrace from the
Barbarians, from his own soldiers and from the inhabitants of a Roman
city. That city, if we may credit the resemblance of name and character,
was the famous Azimuntium, [36] which had alone repelled the tempest of
Attila. The example of her warlike youth was propagated to succeeding
generations; and they obtained, from the first or the second Justin, an
honorable privilege, that their valor should be always reserved for the
defence of their native country. The brother of Maurice attempted
to violate this privilege, and to mingle a patriot band with the
mercenaries of his camp; they retired to the church, he was not awed
by the sanctity of the place; the people rose in their cause, the gates
were shut, the ramparts were manned; and the cowardice of Peter was
found equal to his arrogance and injustice. The military fame of
Commentiolus [37] is the object of satire or comedy rather than of
serious history, since he was even deficient in the vile and vulgar
qualification of personal courage. His solemn councils, strange
evolutions, and secret orders, always supplied an apology for flight or
delay. If he marched against the enemy, the pleasant valleys of Mount
Haemus opposed an insuperable barrier; but in his retreat, he explored,
with fearless curiosity, the most difficult and obsolete paths, which
had almost escaped the memory of the oldest native. The only blood which
he lost was drawn, in a real or affected malady, by the lancet of a
surgeon; and his health, which felt with exquisite sensibility the
approach of the Barbarians, was uniformly restored by the repose and
safety of the winter season. A prince who could promote and support this
unworthy favorite must derive no glory from the accidental merit of his
colleague Priscus. [38] In five successive battles, which seem to have
been conducted with skill and resolution, seventeen thousand two hundred
Barbarians were made prisoners: near sixty thousand, with four sons of
the chagan, were slain: the Roman general surprised a peaceful district
of the Gepidae, who slept under the protection of the Avars; and his
last trophies were erected on the banks of the Danube and the Teyss.
Since the death of Trajan the arms of the empire had not penetrated so
deeply into the old Dacia: yet the success of Priscus was transient and
barren; and he was soon recalled by the apprehension that Baian, with
dauntless spirit and recruited forces, was preparing to avenge his
defeat under the walls of Constantinople. [39]

[Footnote 34: See the march and return of Maurice, in Theophylact, l.
v. c. 16 l. vi. c. 1, 2, 3. If he were a writer of taste or genius,
we might suspect him of an elegant irony: but Theophylact is surely
harmless.]

[Footnote 35: Iliad, xii. 243. This noble verse, which unites the spirit
of a hero with the reason of a sage, may prove that Homer was in every
light superior to his age and country.]

[Footnote 36: Theophylact, l. vii. c. 3. On the evidence of this fact,
which had not occurred to my memory, the candid reader will correct and
excuse a note in Chapter XXXIV., note 86 of this History, which hastens
the decay of Asimus, or Azimuntium; another century of patriotism and
valor is cheaply purchased by such a confession.]

[Footnote 39: The general detail of the war against the Avars may be
traced in the first, second, sixth, seventh, and eighth books of the
history of the emperor Maurice, by Theophylact Simocatta. As he wrote in
the reign of Heraclius, he had no temptation to flatter; but his want
of judgment renders him diffuse in trifles, and concise in the most
interesting facts.]

The theory of war was not more familiar to the camps of Caesar and
Trajan, than to those of Justinian and Maurice. [40] The iron of Tuscany
or Pontus still received the keenest temper from the skill of the
Byzantine workmen. The magazines were plentifully stored with every
species of offensive and defensive arms. In the construction and use of
ships, engines, and fortifications, the Barbarians admired the superior
ingenuity of a people whom they had so often vanquished in the field.
The science of tactics, the order, evolutions, and stratagems of
antiquity, was transcribed and studied in the books of the Greeks and
Romans. But the solitude or degeneracy of the provinces could no longer
supply a race of men to handle those weapons, to guard those walls,
to navigate those ships, and to reduce the theory of war into bold and
successful practice. The genius of Belisarius and Narses had been formed
without a master, and expired without a disciple Neither honor, nor
patriotism, nor generous superstition, could animate the lifeless bodies
of slaves and strangers, who had succeeded to the honors of the legions:
it was in the camp alone that the emperor should have exercised a
despotic command; it was only in the camps that his authority was
disobeyed and insulted: he appeased and inflamed with gold the
licentiousness of the troops; but their vices were inherent, their
victories were accidental, and their costly maintenance exhausted the
substance of a state which they were unable to defend. After a long and
pernicious indulgence, the cure of this inveterate evil was undertaken
by Maurice; but the rash attempt, which drew destruction on his own
head, tended only to aggravate the disease. A reformer should be exempt
from the suspicion of interest, and he must possess the confidence and
esteem of those whom he proposes to reclaim. The troops of Maurice
might listen to the voice of a victorious leader; they disdained the
admonitions of statesmen and sophists; and, when they received an edict
which deducted from their pay the price of their arms and clothing, they
execrated the avarice of a prince insensible of the dangers and fatigues
from which he had escaped.

The camps both of Asia and Europe were agitated with frequent and
furious seditions; [41] the enraged soldiers of Edessa pursued with
reproaches, with threats, with wounds, their trembling generals;
they overturned the statues of the emperor, cast stones against the
miraculous image of Christ, and either rejected the yoke of all
civil and military laws, or instituted a dangerous model of voluntary
subordination. The monarch, always distant and often deceived, was
incapable of yielding or persisting, according to the exigence of the
moment. But the fear of a general revolt induced him too readily to
accept any act of valor, or any expression of loyalty, as an atonement
for the popular offence; the new reform was abolished as hastily as it
had been announced, and the troops, instead of punishment and restraint,
were agreeably surprised by a gracious proclamation of immunities and
rewards. But the soldiers accepted without gratitude the tardy and
reluctant gifts of the emperor: their insolence was elated by the
discovery of his weakness and their own strength; and their mutual
hatred was inflamed beyond the desire of forgiveness or the hope of
reconciliation. The historians of the times adopt the vulgar suspicion,
that Maurice conspired to destroy the troops whom he had labored to
reform; the misconduct and favor of Commentiolus are imputed to this
malevolent design; and every age must condemn the inhumanity of avarice
[42] of a prince, who, by the trifling ransom of six thousand pieces of
gold, might have prevented the massacre of twelve thousand prisoners in
the hands of the chagan. In the just fervor of indignation, an order
was signified to the army of the Danube, that they should spare the
magazines of the province, and establish their winter quarters in the
hostile country of the Avars. The measure of their grievances was full:
they pronounced Maurice unworthy to reign, expelled or slaughtered
his faithful adherents, and, under the command of Phocas, a
simple centurion, returned by hasty marches to the neighborhood of
Constantinople. After a long series of legal succession, the military
disorders of the third century were again revived; yet such was the
novelty of the enterprise, that the insurgents were awed by their
own rashness. They hesitated to invest their favorite with the vacant
purple; and, while they rejected all treaty with Maurice himself,
they held a friendly correspondence with his son Theodosius, and with
Germanus, the father-in-law of the royal youth. So obscure had been the
former condition of Phocas, that the emperor was ignorant of the
name and character of his rival; but as soon as he learned, that the
centurion, though bold in sedition, was timid in the face of danger,
"Alas!" cried the desponding prince, "if he is a coward, he will surely
be a murderer."

[Footnote 40: Maurice himself composed xii books on the military art,
which are still extant, and have been published (Upsal, 1664) by John
Schaeffer, at the end of the Tactics of Arrian, (Fabricius, Bibliot
Graeca, l. iv. c. 8, tom. iii. p. 278,) who promises to speak more fully
of his work in its proper place.]

[Footnote 41: See the mutinies under the reign of Maurice, in
Theophylact l iii c. 1--4,.vi. c. 7, 8, 10, l. vii. c. 1 l. viii. c. 6,
&c.]

[Footnote 42: Theophylact and Theophanes seem ignorant of the conspiracy
and avarice of Maurice. These charges, so unfavorable to the memory
of that emperor, are first mentioned by the author of the Paschal
Chronicle, (p. 379, 280;) from whence Zonaras (tom. ii. l. xiv. p.
77, 78) has transcribed them. Cedrenus (p. 399) has followed another
computation of the ransom.]

Yet if Constantinople had been firm and faithful, the murderer might
have spent his fury against the walls; and the rebel army would have
been gradually consumed or reconciled by the prudence of the emperor.
In the games of the Circus, which he repeated with unusual pomp,
Maurice disguised, with smiles of confidence, the anxiety of his heart,
condescended to solicit the applause of the factions, and flattered
their pride by accepting from their respective tribunes a list of nine
hundred blues and fifteen hundred greens, whom he affected to esteem
as the solid pillars of his throne Their treacherous or languid support
betrayed his weakness and hastened his fall: the green faction were the
secret accomplices of the rebels, and the blues recommended lenity
and moderation in a contest with their Roman brethren The rigid and
parsimonious virtues of Maurice had long since alienated the hearts of
his subjects: as he walked barefoot in a religious procession, he was
rudely assaulted with stones, and his guards were compelled to present
their iron maces in the defence of his person. A fanatic monk ran
through the streets with a drawn sword, denouncing against him the
wrath and the sentence of God; and a vile plebeian, who represented
his countenance and apparel, was seated on an ass, and pursued by the
imprecations of the multitude. [43] The emperor suspected the popularity
of Germanus with the soldiers and citizens: he feared, he threatened,
but he delayed to strike; the patrician fled to the sanctuary of the
church; the people rose in his defence, the walls were deserted by the
guards, and the lawless city was abandoned to the flames and rapine of
a nocturnal tumult. In a small bark, the unfortunate Maurice, with his
wife and nine children, escaped to the Asiatic shore; but the violence
of the wind compelled him to land at the church of St. Autonomus, [44]
near Chalcedon, from whence he despatched Theodosius, he eldest son,
to implore the gratitude and friendship of the Persian monarch. For
himself, he refused to fly: his body was tortured with sciatic pains,
[45] his mind was enfeebled by superstition; he patiently awaited the
event of the revolution, and addressed a fervent and public prayer to
the Almighty, that the punishment of his sins might be inflicted in this
world rather than in a future life. After the abdication of Maurice, the
two factions disputed the choice of an emperor; but the favorite of the
blues was rejected by the jealousy of their antagonists, and Germanus
himself was hurried along by the crowds who rushed to the palace of
Hebdomon, seven miles from the city, to adore the majesty of Phocas the
centurion. A modest wish of resigning the purple to the rank and merit
of Germanus was opposed by his resolution, more obstinate and equally
sincere; the senate and clergy obeyed his summons; and, as soon as
the patriarch was assured of his orthodox belief, he consecrated the
successful usurper in the church of St. John the Baptist. On the third
day, amidst the acclamations of a thoughtless people, Phocas made his
public entry in a chariot drawn by four white horses: the revolt of the
troops was rewarded by a lavish donative; and the new sovereign, after
visiting the palace, beheld from his throne the games of the hippodrome.
In a dispute of precedency between the two factions, his partial
judgment inclined in favor of the greens. "Remember that Maurice is
still alive," resounded from the opposite side; and the indiscreet
clamor of the blues admonished and stimulated the cruelty of the tyrant.
The ministers of death were despatched to Chalcedon: they dragged
the emperor from his sanctuary; and the five sons of Maurice were
successively murdered before the eyes of their agonizing parent. At
each stroke, which he felt in his heart, he found strength to rehearse
a pious ejaculation: "Thou art just, O Lord! and thy judgments are
righteous." And such, in the last moments, was his rigid attachment to
truth and justice, that he revealed to the soldiers the pious falsehood
of a nurse who presented her own child in the place of a royal infant.
[46] The tragic scene was finally closed by the execution of the emperor
himself, in the twentieth year of his reign, and the sixty-third of his
age. The bodies of the father and his five sons were cast into the sea;
their heads were exposed at Constantinople to the insults or pity of the
multitude; and it was not till some signs of putrefaction had appeared,
that Phocas connived at the private burial of these venerable remains.
In that grave, the faults and errors of Maurice were kindly interred.
His fate alone was remembered; and at the end of twenty years, in the
recital of the history of Theophylact, the mournful tale was interrupted
by the tears of the audience. [47]

[Footnote 43: In their clamors against Maurice, the people of
Constantinople branded him with the name of Marcionite or Marcionist; a
heresy (says Theophylact, l. viii. c. 9). Did they only cast out a vague
reproach--or had the emperor really listened to some obscure teacher of
those ancient Gnostics?]

[Footnote 44: The church of St. Autonomous (whom I have not the honor to
know) was 150 stadia from Constantinople, (Theophylact, l. viii. c. 9.)
The port of Eutropius, where Maurice and his children were murdered, is
described by Gyllius (de Bosphoro Thracio, l. iii. c. xi.) as one of the
two harbors of Chalcedon.]

[Footnote 45: The inhabitants of Constantinople were generally subject;
and Theophylact insinuates, (l. viii. c. 9,) that if it were consistent
with the rules of history, he could assign the medical cause. Yet such
a digression would not have been more impertinent than his inquiry (l.
vii. c. 16, 17) into the annual inundations of the Nile, and all the
opinions of the Greek philosophers on that subject.]

[Footnote 46: From this generous attempt, Corneille has deduced the
intricate web of his tragedy of Heraclius, which requires more than one
representation to be clearly understood, (Corneille de Voltaire, tom.
v. p. 300;) and which, after an interval of some years, is said to have
puzzled the author himself, (Anecdotes Dramatiques, tom. i. p. 422.)]

[Footnote 47: The revolt of Phocas and death of Maurice are told by
Theophylact Simocatta, (l. viii. c. 7--12,) the Paschal Chronicle, (p.
379, 380,) Theophanes, (Chronograph. p. 238-244,) Zonaras, (tom. ii. l.
xiv. p. 77--80,) and Cedrenus, (p. 399--404.)]

Such tears must have flowed in secret, and such compassion would have
been criminal, under the reign of Phocas, who was peaceably acknowledged
in the provinces of the East and West. The images of the emperor and his
wife Leontia were exposed in the Lateran to the veneration of the
clergy and senate of Rome, and afterwards deposited in the palace of the
Caesars, between those of Constantine and Theodosius. As a subject and
a Christian, it was the duty of Gregory to acquiesce in the established
government; but the joyful applause with which he salutes the fortune of
the assassin, has sullied, with indelible disgrace, the character of the
saint. The successor of the apostles might have inculcated with decent
firmness the guilt of blood, and the necessity of repentance; he is
content to celebrate the deliverance of the people and the fall of the
oppressor; to rejoice that the piety and benignity of Phocas have been
raised by Providence to the Imperial throne; to pray that his hands may
be strengthened against all his enemies; and to express a wish,
perhaps a prophecy, that, after a long and triumphant reign, he may
be transferred from a temporal to an everlasting kingdom. [48] I have
already traced the steps of a revolution so pleasing, in Gregory's
opinion, both to heaven and earth; and Phocas does not appear less
hateful in the exercise than in the acquisition of power The pencil of
an impartial historian has delineated the portrait of a monster:
[49] his diminutive and deformed person, the closeness of his shaggy
eyebrows, his red hair, his beardless chin, and his cheek disfigured and
discolored by a formidable scar. Ignorant of letters, of laws, and even
of arms, he indulged in the supreme rank a more ample privilege of lust
and drunkenness; and his brutal pleasures were either injurious to his
subjects or disgraceful to himself. Without assuming the office of
a prince, he renounced the profession of a soldier; and the reign of
Phocas afflicted Europe with ignominious peace, and Asia with desolating
war. His savage temper was inflamed by passion, hardened by fear, and
exasperated by resistance of reproach. The flight of Theodosius to the
Persian court had been intercepted by a rapid pursuit, or a deceitful
message: he was beheaded at Nice, and the last hours of the young
prince were soothed by the comforts of religion and the consciousness
of innocence. Yet his phantom disturbed the repose of the usurper: a
whisper was circulated through the East, that the son of Maurice was
still alive: the people expected their avenger, and the widow and
daughters of the late emperor would have adopted as their son and
brother the vilest of mankind. In the massacre of the Imperial family,
[50] the mercy, or rather the discretion, of Phocas had spared these
unhappy females, and they were decently confined to a private house. But
the spirit of the empress Constantina, still mindful of her father, her
husband, and her sons, aspired to freedom and revenge. At the dead of
night, she escaped to the sanctuary of St. Sophia; but her tears, and
the gold of her associate Germanus, were insufficient to provoke an
insurrection. Her life was forfeited to revenge, and even to justice:
but the patriarch obtained and pledged an oath for her safety: a
monastery was allotted for her prison, and the widow of Maurice accepted
and abused the lenity of his assassin. The discovery or the suspicion of
a second conspiracy, dissolved the engagements, and rekindled the fury,
of Phocas. A matron who commanded the respect and pity of mankind, the
daughter, wife, and mother of emperors, was tortured like the vilest
malefactor, to force a confession of her designs and associates; and the
empress Constantina, with her three innocent daughters, was beheaded at
Chalcedon, on the same ground which had been stained with the blood
of her husband and five sons. After such an example, it would be
superfluous to enumerate the names and sufferings of meaner victims.
Their condemnation was seldom preceded by the forms of trial, and their
punishment was embittered by the refinements of cruelty: their eyes were
pierced, their tongues were torn from the root, the hands and feet were
amputated; some expired under the lash, others in the flames; others
again were transfixed with arrows; and a simple speedy death was mercy
which they could rarely obtain. The hippodrome, the sacred asylum of
the pleasures and the liberty of the Romans, was polluted with heads and
limbs, and mangled bodies; and the companions of Phocas were the most
sensible, that neither his favor, nor their services, could protect them
from a tyrant, the worthy rival of the Caligulas and Domitians of the
first age of the empire. [51]

[Footnote 48: Gregor. l. xi. epist. 38, indict. vi. Benignitatem vestrae
pietatis ad Imperiale fastigium pervenisse gaudemus. Laetentur coeli
et exultet terra, et de vestris benignis actibus universae republicae
populus nunc usque vehementer afflictus hilarescat, &c. This base
flattery, the topic of Protestant invective, is justly censured by the
philosopher Bayle, (Dictionnaire Critique, Gregoire I. Not. H. tom. ii.
p. 597 598.) Cardinal Baronius justifies the pope at the expense of the
fallen emperor.]

[Footnote 49: The images of Phocas were destroyed; but even the malice
of his enemies would suffer one copy of such a portrait or caricature
(Cedrenus, p. 404) to escape the flames.]

[Footnote 50: The family of Maurice is represented by Ducange, (Familiae
By zantinae, p. 106, 107, 108;) his eldest son Theodosius had been
crowned emperor, when he was no more than four years and a half old, and
he is always joined with his father in the salutations of Gregory. With
the Christian daughters, Anastasia and Theocteste, I am surprised to
find the Pagan name of Cleopatra.]

[Footnote 51: Some of the cruelties of Phocas are marked by Theophylact,
l. viii. c. 13, 14, 15. George of Pisidia, the poet of Heraclius, styles
him (Bell. Avaricum, p. 46, Rome, 1777). The latter epithet is just--but
the corrupter of life was easily vanquished.]
