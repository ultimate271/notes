## Chapter LII: More Conquests By The Arabs.--Part II.

Constantinople and the Greek fire might exclude the Arabs from the
eastern entrance of Europe; but in the West, on the side of the
Pyrenees, the provinces of Gaul were threatened and invaded by the
conquerors of Spain. [25] The decline of the French monarchy invited the
attack of these insatiate fanatics. The descendants of Clovis had
lost the inheritance of his martial and ferocious spirit; and their
misfortune or demerit has affixed the epithet of lazy to the last kings
of the Merovingian race. [26] They ascended the throne without power,
and sunk into the grave without a name. A country palace, in the
neighborhood of Compiegne [27] was allotted for their residence or
prison: but each year, in the month of March or May, they were conducted
in a wagon drawn by oxen to the assembly of the Franks, to give audience
to foreign ambassadors, and to ratify the acts of the mayor of the
palace. That domestic officer was become the minister of the nation and
the master of the prince. A public employment was converted into the
patrimony of a private family: the elder Pepin left a king of mature
years under the guardianship of his own widow and her child; and these
feeble regents were forcibly dispossessed by the most active of his
bastards. A government, half savage and half corrupt, was almost
dissolved; and the tributary dukes, and provincial counts, and the
territorial lords, were tempted to despise the weakness of the monarch,
and to imitate the ambition of the mayor. Among these independent
chiefs, one of the boldest and most successful was Eudes, duke of
Aquitain, who in the southern provinces of Gaul usurped the authority,
and even the title of king. The Goths, the Gascons, and the Franks,
assembled under the standard of this Christian hero: he repelled the
first invasion of the Saracens; and Zama, lieutenant of the caliph, lost
his army and his life under the walls of Thoulouse. The ambition of his
successors was stimulated by revenge; they repassed the Pyrenees with
the means and the resolution of conquest. The advantageous situation
which had recommended Narbonne [28] as the first Roman colony, was
again chosen by the Moslems: they claimed the province of Septimania or
Languedoc as a just dependence of the Spanish monarchy: the vineyards
of Gascony and the city of Bourdeaux were possessed by the sovereign of
Damascus and Samarcand; and the south of France, from the mouth of
the Garonne to that of the Rhone, assumed the manners and religion of
Arabia.

Charles Martel, see the Historia Arabum (c. 11, 12, 13, 14) of Roderic
Ximenes, archbishop of Toledo, who had before him the Christian
chronicle of Isidore Pacensis, and the Mahometan history of Novairi.
The Moslems are silent or concise in the account of their losses; but M
Cardonne (tom. i. p. 129, 130, 131) has given a pure and simple account
of all that he could collect from Ibn Halikan, Hidjazi, and an anonymous
writer. The texts of the chronicles of France, and lives of saints, are
inserted in the Collection of Bouquet, (tom. iii.,) and the Annals
of Pagi, who (tom. iii. under the proper years) has restored the
chronology, which is anticipated six years in the Annals of Baronius.
The Dictionary of Bayle (Abderame and Munuza) has more merit for lively
reflection than original research.]

Charlemagne of exaggerating the weakness of the Merovingians; but the
general outline is just, and the French reader will forever repeat the
beautiful lines of Boileau's Lutrin.]

was a palace of more dignity, (Hadrian. Valesii Notitia Galliarum, p.
152,) and that laughing philosopher, the Abbe Galliani, (Dialogues sur
le Commerce des Bleds,) may truly affirm, that it was the residence of
the rois tres Chretiens en tres chevelus.]

[Footnote 28: Even before that colony, A. U. C. 630, (Velleius Patercul.
i. 15,) In the time of Polybius, (Hist. l. iii. p. 265, edit. Gronov.)
Narbonne was a Celtic town of the first eminence, and one of the most
northern places of the known world, (D'Anville, Notice de l'Ancienne
Gaule, p. 473.)]

But these narrow limits were scorned by the spirit of Abdalraman, or
Abderame, who had been restored by the caliph Hashem to the wishes of
the soldiers and people of Spain. That veteran and daring commander
adjudged to the obedience of the prophet whatever yet remained of France
or of Europe; and prepared to execute the sentence, at the head of a
formidable host, in the full confidence of surmounting all opposition
either of nature or of man. His first care was to suppress a domestic
rebel, who commanded the most important passes of the Pyrenees: Manuza,
a Moorish chief, had accepted the alliance of the duke of Aquitain;
and Eudes, from a motive of private or public interest, devoted his
beauteous daughter to the embraces of the African misbeliever. But the
strongest fortresses of Cerdagne were invested by a superior force; the
rebel was overtaken and slain in the mountains; and his widow was sent
a captive to Damascus, to gratify the desires, or more probably the
vanity, of the commander of the faithful. From the Pyrenees, Abderame
proceeded without delay to the passage of the Rhone and the siege of
Arles.

An army of Christians attempted the relief of the city: the tombs of
their leaders were yet visible in the thirteenth century; and many
thousands of their dead bodies were carried down the rapid stream into
the Mediterranean Sea. The arms of Abderame were not less successful
on the side of the ocean. He passed without opposition the Garonne and
Dordogne, which unite their waters in the Gulf of Bourdeaux; but he
found, beyond those rivers, the camp of the intrepid Eudes, who had
formed a second army and sustained a second defeat, so fatal to the
Christians, that, according to their sad confession, God alone could
reckon the number of the slain. The victorious Saracen overran the
provinces of Aquitain, whose Gallic names are disguised, rather than
lost, in the modern appellations of Perigord, Saintonge, and Poitou: his
standards were planted on the walls, or at least before the gates,
of Tours and of Sens; and his detachments overspread the kingdom of
Burgundy as far as the well-known cities of Lyons and Besan√ßon. The
memory of these devastations (for Abderame did not spare the country or
the people) was long preserved by tradition; and the invasion of France
by the Moors or Mahometans affords the groundwork of those fables,
which have been so wildly disfigured in the romances of chivalry, and
so elegantly adorned by the Italian muse. In the decline of society and
art, the deserted cities could supply a slender booty to the Saracens;
their richest spoil was found in the churches and monasteries, which
they stripped of their ornaments and delivered to the flames: and the
tutelar saints, both Hilary of Poitiers and Martin of Tours, forgot
their miraculous powers in the defence of their own sepulchres. [29] A
victorious line of march had been prolonged above a thousand miles from
the rock of Gibraltar to the banks of the Loire; the repetition of an
equal space would have carried the Saracens to the confines of Poland
and the Highlands of Scotland; the Rhine is not more impassable than
the Nile or Euphrates, and the Arabian fleet might have sailed without a
naval combat into the mouth of the Thames. Perhaps the interpretation of
the Koran would now be taught in the schools of Oxford, and her pulpits
might demonstrate to a circumcised people the sanctity and truth of the
revelation of Mahomet. [30]

[Footnote 29: With regard to the sanctuary of St. Martin of Tours,
Roderic Ximenes accuses the Saracens of the deed. Turonis civitatem,
ecclesiam et palatia vastatione et incendio simili diruit et consumpsit.
The continuator of Fredegarius imputes to them no more than the
intention. Ad domum beatissimi Martini evertendam destinant. At Carolus,
&c. The French annalist was more jealous of the honor of the saint.]

[Footnote 30: Yet I sincerely doubt whether the Oxford mosch would have
produced a volume of controversy so elegant and ingenious as the sermons
lately preached by Mr. White, the Arabic professor, at Mr. Bampton's
lecture. His observations on the character and religion of Mahomet
are always adapted to his argument, and generally founded in truth and
reason. He sustains the part of a lively and eloquent advocate; and
sometimes rises to the merit of an historian and philosopher.]

From such calamities was Christendom delivered by the genius and fortune
of one man. Charles, the illegitimate son of the elder Pepin, was
content with the titles of mayor or duke of the Franks; but he deserved
to become the father of a line of kings. In a laborious administration
of twenty-four years, he restored and supported the dignity of the
throne, and the rebels of Germany and Gaul were successively crushed by
the activity of a warrior, who, in the same campaign, could display
his banner on the Elbe, the Rhone, and the shores of the ocean. In
the public danger he was summoned by the voice of his country; and his
rival, the duke of Aquitain, was reduced to appear among the fugitives
and suppliants. "Alas!" exclaimed the Franks, "what a misfortune! what
an indignity! We have long heard of the name and conquests of the
Arabs: we were apprehensive of their attack from the East; they have
now conquered Spain, and invade our country on the side of the West. Yet
their numbers, and (since they have no buckler) their arms, are inferior
to our own." "If you follow my advice," replied the prudent mayor of
the palace, "you will not interrupt their march, nor precipitate your
attack. They are like a torrent, which it is dangerous to stem in its
career. The thirst of riches, and the consciousness of success, redouble
their valor, and valor is of more avail than arms or numbers. Be patient
till they have loaded themselves with the encumbrance of wealth. The
possession of wealth will divide their councils and assure your
victory." This subtile policy is perhaps a refinement of the Arabian
writers; and the situation of Charles will suggest a more narrow and
selfish motive of procrastination--the secret desire of humbling the
pride and wasting the provinces of the rebel duke of Aquitain. It is yet
more probable, that the delays of Charles were inevitable and reluctant.
A standing army was unknown under the first and second race; more than
half the kingdom was now in the hands of the Saracens: according to
their respective situation, the Franks of Neustria and Austrasia were to
conscious or too careless of the impending danger; and the voluntary
aids of the Gepidae and Germans were separated by a long interval from
the standard of the Christian general. No sooner had he collected his
forces, than he sought and found the enemy in the centre of France,
between Tours and Poitiers. His well-conducted march was covered with a
range of hills, and Abderame appears to have been surprised by his
unexpected presence. The nations of Asia, Africa, and Europe, advanced
with equal ardor to an encounter which would change the history of the
world. In the six first days of desultory combat, the horsemen and
archers of the East maintained their advantage: but in the closer onset
of the seventh day, the Orientals were oppressed by the strength and
stature of the Germans, who, with stout hearts and iron hands, [31]
asserted the civil and religious freedom of their posterity. The epithet
of Martel, the Hammer, which has been added to the name of Charles, is
expressive of his weighty and irresistible strokes: the valor of Eudes
was excited by resentment and emulation; and their companions, in the
eye of history, are the true Peers and Paladins of French chivalry.
After a bloody field, in which Abderame was slain, the Saracens, in the
close of the evening, retired to their camp. In the disorder and despair
of the night, the various tribes of Yemen and Damascus, of Africa and
Spain, were provoked to turn their arms against each other: the remains
of their host were suddenly dissolved, and each emir consulted his
safety by a hasty and separate retreat. At the dawn of the day, the
stillness of a hostile camp was suspected by the victorious Christians:
on the report of their spies, they ventured to explore the riches of the
vacant tents; but if we except some celebrated relics, a small portion
of the spoil was restored to the innocent and lawful owners. The joyful
tidings were soon diffused over the Catholic world, and the monks of
Italy could affirm and believe that three hundred and fifty, or three
hundred and seventy-five, thousand of the Mahometans had been crushed by
the hammer of Charles, [32] while no more than fifteen hundred
Christians were slain in the field of Tours. But this incredible tale is
sufficiently disproved by the caution of the French general, who
apprehended the snares and accidents of a pursuit, and dismissed his
German allies to their native forests.

The inactivity of a conqueror betrays the loss of strength and blood,
and the most cruel execution is inflicted, not in the ranks of battle,
but on the backs of a flying enemy. Yet the victory of the Franks was
complete and final; Aquitain was recovered by the arms of Eudes; the
Arabs never resumed the conquest of Gaul, and they were soon driven
beyond the Pyrenees by Charles Martel and his valiant race. [33] It
might have been expected that the savior of Christendom would have been
canonized, or at least applauded, by the gratitude of the clergy, who
are indebted to his sword for their present existence. But in the
public distress, the mayor of the palace had been compelled to apply
the riches, or at least the revenues, of the bishops and abbots, to
the relief of the state and the reward of the soldiers. His merits were
forgotten, his sacrilege alone was remembered, and, in an epistle to
a Carlovingian prince, a Gallic synod presumes to declare that his
ancestor was damned; that on the opening of his tomb, the spectators
were affrighted by a smell of fire and the aspect of a horrid dragon;
and that a saint of the times was indulged with a pleasant vision of the
soul and body of Charles Martel, burning, to all eternity, in the abyss
of hell. [34]

[Footnote 32: These numbers are stated by Paul Warnefrid, the deacon
of Aquileia, (de Gestis Langobard. l. vi. p. 921, edit. Grot.,) and
Anastasius, the librarian of the Roman church, (in Vit. Gregorii
II.,) who tells a miraculous story of three consecrated sponges, which
rendered invulnerable the French soldiers, among whom they had been
shared It should seem, that in his letters to the pope, Eudes usurped
the honor of the victory, from which he is chastised by the French
annalists, who, with equal falsehood, accuse him of inviting the
Saracens.]

[Footnote 33: Narbonne, and the rest of Septimania, was recovered by
Pepin the son of Charles Martel, A.D. 755, (Pagi, Critica, tom. iii. p.
300.) Thirty-seven years afterwards, it was pillaged by a sudden inroad
of the Arabs, who employed the captives in the construction of the mosch
of Cordova, (De Guignes, Hist. des Huns, tom. i. p. 354.)]

[Footnote 34: This pastoral letter, addressed to Lewis the Germanic, the
grandson of Charlemagne, and most probably composed by the pen of the
artful Hincmar, is dated in the year 858, and signed by the bishops of
the provinces of Rheims and Rouen, (Baronius, Annal. Eccles. A.D. 741.
Fleury, Hist. Eccles. tom. x. p. 514-516.) Yet Baronius himself, and
the French critics, reject with contempt this episcopal fiction.]

The loss of an army, or a province, in the Western world, was less
painful to the court of Damascus, than the rise and progress of a
domestic competitor. Except among the Syrians, the caliphs of the house
of Ommiyah had never been the objects of the public favor. The life of
Mahomet recorded their perseverance in idolatry and rebellion: their
conversion had been reluctant, their elevation irregular and factious,
and their throne was cemented with the most holy and noble blood of
Arabia. The best of their race, the pious Omar, was dissatisfied with
his own title: their personal virtues were insufficient to justify a
departure from the order of succession; and the eyes and wishes of the
faithful were turned towards the line of Hashem, and the kindred of
the apostle of God. Of these the Fatimites were either rash or
pusillanimous; but the descendants of Abbas cherished, with courage
and discretion, the hopes of their rising fortunes. From an obscure
residence in Syria, they secretly despatched their agents and
missionaries, who preached in the Eastern provinces their hereditary
indefeasible right; and Mohammed, the son of Ali, the son of Abdallah,
the son of Abbas, the uncle of the prophet, gave audience to the
deputies of Chorasan, and accepted their free gift of four hundred
thousand pieces of gold. After the death of Mohammed, the oath of
allegiance was administered in the name of his son Ibrahim to a numerous
band of votaries, who expected only a signal and a leader; and the
governor of Chorasan continued to deplore his fruitless admonitions and
the deadly slumber of the caliphs of Damascus, till he himself, with
all his adherents, was driven from the city and palace of Meru, by the
rebellious arms of Abu Moslem. [35] That maker of kings, the author, as
he is named, of the call of the Abbassides, was at length rewarded for
his presumption of merit with the usual gratitude of courts. A mean,
perhaps a foreign, extraction could not repress the aspiring energy of
Abu Moslem. Jealous of his wives, liberal of his wealth, prodigal of
his own blood and of that of others, he could boast with pleasure, and
possibly with truth, that he had destroyed six hundred thousand of his
enemies; and such was the intrepid gravity of his mind and countenance,
that he was never seen to smile except on a day of battle. In the
visible separation of parties, the green was consecrated to the
Fatimites; the Ommiades were distinguished by the white; and the black,
as the most adverse, was naturally adopted by the Abbassides. Their
turbans and garments were stained with that gloomy color: two black
standards, on pike staves nine cubits long, were borne aloft in the van
of Abu Moslem; and their allegorical names of the night and the shadow
obscurely represented the indissoluble union and perpetual succession
of the line of Hashem. From the Indus to the Euphrates, the East was
convulsed by the quarrel of the white and the black factions: the
Abbassides were most frequently victorious; but their public success
was clouded by the personal misfortune of their chief. The court
of Damascus, awakening from a long slumber, resolved to prevent the
pilgrimage of Mecca, which Ibrahim had undertaken with a splendid
retinue, to recommend himself at once to the favor of the prophet and of
the people. A detachment of cavalry intercepted his march and arrested
his person; and the unhappy Ibrahim, snatched away from the promise of
untasted royalty, expired in iron fetters in the dungeons of Haran. His
two younger brothers, Saffah [3511] and Almansor, eluded the search of
the tyrant, and lay concealed at Cufa, till the zeal of the people and
the approach of his Eastern friends allowed them to expose their persons
to the impatient public. On Friday, in the dress of a caliph, in the
colors of the sect, Saffah proceeded with religious and military pomp
to the mosch: ascending the pulpit, he prayed and preached as the lawful
successor of Mahomet; and after his departure, his kinsmen bound a
willing people by an oath of fidelity. But it was on the banks of the
Zab, and not in the mosch of Cufa, that this important controversy was
determined. Every advantage appeared to be on the side of the white
faction: the authority of established government; an army of a hundred
and twenty thousand soldiers, against a sixth part of that number; and
the presence and merit of the caliph Mervan, the fourteenth and last
of the house of Ommiyah. Before his accession to the throne, he had
deserved, by his Georgian warfare, the honorable epithet of the ass of
Mesopotamia; [36] and he might have been ranked amongst the greatest
princes, had not, says Abulfeda, the eternal order decreed that moment
for the ruin of his family; a decree against which all human fortitude
and prudence must struggle in vain. The orders of Mervan were mistaken,
or disobeyed: the return of his horse, from which he had dismounted on
a necessary occasion, impressed the belief of his death; and the
enthusiasm of the black squadrons was ably conducted by Abdallah, the
uncle of his competitor. After an irretrievab defeat, the caliph escaped
to Mosul; but the colors of the Abbassides were displayed from the
rampart; he suddenly repassed the Tigris, cast a melancholy look on his
palace of Haran, crossed the Euphrates, abandoned the fortifications of
Damascus, and, without halting in Palestine, pitched his last and fatal
camp at Busir, on the banks of the Nile. [37] His speed was urged by
the incessant diligence of Abdallah, who in every step of the pursuit
acquired strength and reputation: the remains of the white faction were
finally vanquished in Egypt; and the lance, which terminated the life
and anxiety of Mervan, was not less welcome perhaps to the unfortunate
than to the victorious chief. The merciless inquisition of the conqueror
eradicated the most distant branches of the hostile race: their bones
were scattered, their memory was accursed, and the martyrdom of Hossein
was abundantly revenged on the posterity of his tyrants. Fourscore of
the Ommiades, who had yielded to the faith or clemency of their foes,
were invited to a banquet at Damascus. The laws of hospitality were
violated by a promiscuous massacre: the board was spread over their
fallen bodies; and the festivity of the guests was enlivened by the
music of their dying groans. By the event of the civil war, the dynasty
of the Abbassides was firmly established; but the Christians only
could triumph in the mutual hatred and common loss of the disciples of
Mahomet. [38]

[Footnote 35: The steed and the saddle which had carried any of his
wives were instantly killed or burnt, lest they should afterwards be
mounted by a male. Twelve hundred mules or camels were required for his
kitchen furniture; and the daily consumption amounted to three thousand
cakes, a hundred sheep, besides oxen, poultry, &c., (Abul pharagius,
Hist. Dynast. p. 140.)]

[Footnote 3511: He is called Abdullah or Abul Abbas in the Tarikh Tebry.

[Footnote 36: Al Hemar. He had been governor of Mesopotamia, and the
Arabic proverb praises the courage of that warlike breed of asses
who never fly from an enemy. The surname of Mervan may justify the
comparison of Homer, (Iliad, A. 557, &c.,) and both will silence
the moderns, who consider the ass as a stupid and ignoble emblem,
(D'Herbelot, Bibliot. Orient. p. 558.)]

[Footnote 37: Four several places, all in Egypt, bore the name of Busir,
or Busiris, so famous in Greek fable. The first, where Mervan was slain
was to the west of the Nile, in the province of Fium, or Arsinoe;
the second in the Delta, in the Sebennytic nome; the third near the
pyramids; the fourth, which was destroyed by Dioclesian, (see above,
vol. ii. p. 130,) in the Thebais. I shall here transcribe a note of the
learned and orthodox Michaelis: Videntur in pluribus Aegypti superioris
urbibus Busiri Coptoque arma sumpsisse Christiani, libertatemque de

Yet the thousands who were swept away by the sword of war might
have been speedily retrieved in the succeeding generation, if the
consequences of the revolution had not tended to dissolve the power
and unity of the empire of the Saracens. In the proscription of the
Ommiades, a royal youth of the name of Abdalrahman alone escaped the
rage of his enemies, who hunted the wandering exile from the banks
of the Euphrates to the valleys of Mount Atlas. His presence in the
neighborhood of Spain revived the zeal of the white faction. The name
and cause of the Abbassides had been first vindicated by the Persians:
the West had been pure from civil arms; and the servants of the
abdicated family still held, by a precarious tenure, the inheritance
of their lands and the offices of government. Strongly prompted by
gratitude, indignation, and fear, they invited the grandson of the
caliph Hashem to ascend the throne of his ancestors; and, in his
desperate condition, the extremes of rashness and prudence were almost
the same. The acclamations of the people saluted his landing on the
coast of Andalusia: and, after a successful struggle, Abdalrahman
established the throne of Cordova, and was the father of the Ommiades of
Spain, who reigned above two hundred and fifty years from the Atlantic
to the Pyrenees. [39] He slew in battle a lieutenant of the Abbassides,
who had invaded his dominions with a fleet and army: the head of Ala, in
salt and camphire, was suspended by a daring messenger before the palace
of Mecca; and the caliph Almansor rejoiced in his safety, that he was
removed by seas and lands from such a formidable adversary. Their mutual
designs or declarations of offensive war evaporated without effect;
but instead of opening a door to the conquest of Europe, Spain was
dissevered from the trunk of the monarchy, engaged in perpetual
hostility with the East, and inclined to peace and friendship with the
Christian sovereigns of Constantinople and France. The example of the
Ommiades was imitated by the real or fictitious progeny of Ali, the
Edrissites of Mauritania, and the more powerful fatimites of Africa and
Egypt. In the tenth century, the chair of Mahomet was disputed by three
caliphs or commanders of the faithful, who reigned at Bagdad, Cairoan,
and Cordova, excommunicating each other, and agreed only in a principle
of discord, that a sectary is more odious and criminal than an
unbeliever. [40]

edition de Lausanne) concerning the division of the Saracen empire. The
mistakes of Voltaire proceeded from the want of knowledge or reflection;
but Sir William was deceived by a Spanish impostor, who has framed an
apocryphal history of the conquest of Spain by the Arabs.]

Mecca was the patrimony of the line of Hashem, yet the Abbassides were
never tempted to reside either in the birthplace or the city of the
prophet. Damascus was disgraced by the choice, and polluted with the
blood, of the Ommiades; and, after some hesitation, Almansor, the
brother and successor of Saffah, laid the foundations of Bagdad, [41]
the Imperial seat of his posterity during a reign of five hundred years.
[42] The chosen spot is on the eastern bank of the Tigris, about fifteen
miles above the ruins of Modain: the double wall was of a circular
form; and such was the rapid increase of a capital, now dwindled to a
provincial town, that the funeral of a popular saint might be attended
by eight hundred thousand men and sixty thousand women of Bagdad and the
adjacent villages. In this city of peace, [43] amidst the riches of the
East, the Abbassides soon disdained the abstinence and frugality of the
first caliphs, and aspired to emulate the magnificence of the Persian
kings. After his wars and buildings, Almansor left behind him in gold
and silver about thirty millions sterling: [44] and this treasure was
exhausted in a few years by the vices or virtues of his children. His
son Mahadi, in a single pilgrimage to Mecca, expended six millions
of dinars of gold. A pious and charitable motive may sanctify the
foundation of cisterns and caravanseras, which he distributed along a
measured road of seven hundred miles; but his train of camels, laden
with snow, could serve only to astonish the natives of Arabia, and to
refresh the fruits and liquors of the royal banquet. [45] The courtiers
would surely praise the liberality of his grandson Almamon, who gave
away four fifths of the income of a province, a sum of two millions four
hundred thousand gold dinars, before he drew his foot from the stirrup.
At the nuptials of the same prince, a thousand pearls of the largest
size were showered on the head of the bride, [46] and a lottery of lands
and houses displayed the capricious bounty of fortune. The glories of
the court were brightened, rather than impaired, in the decline of the
empire, and a Greek ambassador might admire, or pity, the magnificence
of the feeble Moctader. "The caliph's whole army," says the historian
Abulfeda, "both horse and foot, was under arms, which together made
a body of one hundred and sixty thousand men. His state officers,
the favorite slaves, stood near him in splendid apparel, their belts
glittering with gold and gems. Near them were seven thousand eunuchs,
four thousand of them white, the remainder black. The porters or
door-keepers were in number seven hundred. Barges and boats, with the
most superb decorations, were seen swimming upon the Tigris. Nor was the
palace itself less splendid, in which were hung up thirty-eight thousand
pieces of tapestry, twelve thousand five hundred of which were of
silk embroidered with gold. The carpets on the floor were twenty-two
thousand. A hundred lions were brought out, with a keeper to each lion.
[47] Among the other spectacles of rare and stupendous luxury was a tree
of gold and silver spreading into eighteen large branches, on which, and
on the lesser boughs, sat a variety of birds made of the same precious
metals, as well as the leaves of the tree. While the machinery affected
spontaneous motions, the several birds warbled their natural harmony.
Through this scene of magnificence, the Greek ambassador was led by
the vizier to the foot of the caliph's throne." [48] In the West, the
Ommiades of Spain supported, with equal pomp, the title of commander
of the faithful. Three miles from Cordova, in honor of his favorite
sultana, the third and greatest of the Abdalrahmans constructed the
city, palace, and gardens of Zehra. Twenty-five years, and above three
millions sterling, were employed by the founder: his liberal taste
invited the artists of Constantinople, the most skilful sculptors and
architects of the age; and the buildings were sustained or adorned by
twelve hundred columns of Spanish and African, of Greek and Italian
marble. The hall of audience was incrusted with gold and pearls, and
a great basin in the centre was surrounded with the curious and costly
figures of birds and quadrupeds. In a lofty pavilion of the gardens, one
of these basins and fountains, so delightful in a sultry climate,
was replenished not with water, but with the purest quicksilver. The
seraglio of Abdalrahman, his wives, concubines, and black eunuchs,
amounted to six thousand three hundred persons: and he was attended to
the field by a guard of twelve thousand horse, whose belts and cimeters
were studded with gold. [49]

121-123,) and the Orientalist D'Herbelot, (Bibliotheque, p. 167, 168,)
may suffice for the knowledge of Bagdad. Our travellers, Pietro

Thevenot, (part ii. p. 209-212,) Otter, (tom. i. p. 162-168,) and
Niebuhr, (Voyage en Arabie, tom. ii. p. 239-271,) have seen only its
decay; and the Nubian geographer, (p. 204,) and the travelling Jew,
Benjamin of Tuleda (Itinerarium, p. 112-123, a Const. l'Empereur, apud
Elzevir, 1633,) are the only writers of my acquaintance, who have known
Bagdad under the reign of the Abbassides.]

Mostasem, the last of the Abbassides, was taken and put to death by the
Tartars, A. H. 656, A.D. 1258, the 20th of February.]

[Footnote 43: Medinat al Salem, Dar al Salem. Urbs pacis, or, as it is
more neatly compounded by the Byzantine writers, (Irenopolis.) There is
some dispute concerning the etymology of Bagdad, but the first syllable
is allowed to signify a garden in the Persian tongue; the garden of
Dad, a Christian hermit, whose cell had been the only habitation on the
spot.]

proportion to the silver as twelve to one. But I will never answer for
the numbers of Erpenius; and the Latins are scarcely above the savages
in the language of arithmetic.]

[Footnote 46: Abulfeda (p. 184, 189) describes the splendor and
liberality of Almamon. Milton has alluded to this Oriental custom:--

     Or where the gorgeous East, with richest hand,

     Showers on her kings Barbaric pearls and gold.

I have used the modern word lottery to express the word of the Roman
emperors, which entitled to some prize the person who caught them, as
they were thrown among the crowd.]

Shah Hussein of Persia, two lions were introduced, to denote the power
of the king over the fiercest animals.]

received at Bagdad, A. H. 305, A.D. 917. In the passage of Abulfeda, I
have used, with some variations, the English translation of the learned
and amiable Mr. Harris of Salisbury, (Philological Enquiries p. 363,
364.)]
