From the Isle of Sicily, the reader must transport himself beyond the
Caspian Sea, to the original seat of the Turks or Turkmans, against whom
the first crusade was principally directed. Their Scythian empire of the
sixth century was long since dissolved; but the name was still famous
among the Greeks and Orientals; and the fragments of the nation, each
a powerful and independent people, were scattered over the desert from
China to the Oxus and the Danube: the colony of Hungarians was admitted
into the republic of Europe, and the thrones of Asia were occupied by
slaves and soldiers of Turkish extraction. While Apulia and Sicily
were subdued by the Norman lance, a swarm of these northern shepherds
overspread the kingdoms of Persia; their princes of the race of Seljuk
erected a splendid and solid empire from Samarcand to the confines of
Greece and Egypt; and the Turks have maintained their dominion in Asia
Minor, till the victorious crescent has been planted on the dome of St.
Sophia.

One of the greatest of the Turkish princes was Mahmood or Mahmud, [1]
the Gaznevide, who reigned in the eastern provinces of Persia, one
thousand years after the birth of Christ. His father Sebectagi was the
slave of the slave of the slave of the commander of the faithful. But in
this descent of servitude, the first degree was merely titular, since it
was filled by the sovereign of Transoxiana and Chorasan, who still paid
a nominal allegiance to the caliph of Bagdad. The second rank was that
of a minister of state, a lieutenant of the Samanides, [2] who broke,
by his revolt, the bonds of political slavery. But the third step was a
state of real and domestic servitude in the family of that rebel; from
which Sebectagi, by his courage and dexterity, ascended to the supreme
command of the city and provinces of Gazna, [3] as the son-in-law and
successor of his grateful master.

The falling dynasty of the Samanides was at first protected, and at last
overthrown, by their servants; and, in the public disorders, the fortune
of Mahmud continually increased. From him the title of Sultan [4] was
first invented; and his kingdom was enlarged from Transoxiana to the
neighborhood of Ispahan, from the shores of the Caspian to the mouth of
the Indus. But the principal source of his fame and riches was the holy
war which he waged against the Gentoos of Hindostan. In this foreign
narrative I may not consume a page; and a volume would scarcely suffice
to recapitulate the battles and sieges of his twelve expeditions. Never
was the Mussulman hero dismayed by the inclemency of the seasons, the
height of the mountains, the breadth of the rivers, the barrenness of
the desert, the multitudes of the enemy, or the formidable array of
their elephants of war. [5] The sultan of Gazna surpassed the limits
of the conquests of Alexander: after a march of three months, over the
hills of Cashmir and Thibet, he reached the famous city of Kinnoge, [6]
on the Upper Ganges; and, in a naval combat on one of the branches of
the Indus, he fought and vanquished four thousand boats of the natives.
Delhi, Lahor, and Multan, were compelled to open their gates: the
fertile kingdom of Guzarat attracted his ambition and tempted his stay;
and his avarice indulged the fruitless project of discovering the golden
and aromatic isles of the Southern Ocean. On the payment of a tribute,
the rajahs preserved their dominions; the people, their lives and
fortunes; but to the religion of Hindostan the zealous Mussulman was
cruel and inexorable: many hundred temples, or pagodas, were levelled
with the ground; many thousand idols were demolished; and the servants
of the prophet were stimulated and rewarded by the precious materials
of which they were composed. The pagoda of Sumnat was situate on the
promontory of Guzarat, in the neighborhood of Diu, one of the last
remaining possessions of the Portuguese. [7] It was endowed with the
revenue of two thousand villages; two thousand Brahmins were consecrated
to the service of the Deity, whom they washed each morning and evening
in water from the distant Ganges: the subordinate ministers consisted of
three hundred musicians, three hundred barbers, and five hundred dancing
girls, conspicuous for their birth or beauty. Three sides of the temple
were protected by the ocean, the narrow isthmus was fortified by a
natural or artificial precipice; and the city and adjacent country
were peopled by a nation of fanatics. They confessed the sins and the
punishment of Kinnoge and Delhi; but if the impious stranger should
presume to approach their holy precincts, he would surely be overwhelmed
by a blast of the divine vengeance. By this challenge, the faith of
Mahmud was animated to a personal trial of the strength of this Indian
deity. Fifty thousand of his worshippers were pierced by the spear of
the Moslems; the walls were scaled; the sanctuary was profaned; and the
conqueror aimed a blow of his iron mace at the head of the idol. The
trembling Brahmins are said to have offered ten millions [711] sterling
for his ransom; and it was urged by the wisest counsellors, that the
destruction of a stone image would not change the hearts of the Gentoos;
and that such a sum might be dedicated to the relief of the true
believers. "Your reasons," replied the sultan, "are specious and strong;
but never in the eyes of posterity shall Mahmud appear as a merchant
of idols." [712] He repeated his blows, and a treasure of pearls and
rubies, concealed in the belly of the statue, explained in some degree
the devout prodigality of the Brahmins. The fragments of the idol were
distributed to Gazna, Mecca, and Medina. Bagdad listened to the edifying
tale; and Mahmud was saluted by the caliph with the title of guardian of
the fortune and faith of Mahomet.

Hindostan, he styles himself the translator of the Persian Ferishta; but
in his florid text, it is not easy to distinguish the version and the
original. * Note: The European reader now possesses a more accurate
version of Ferishta, that of Col. Briggs. Of Col. Dow's work, Col.
Briggs observes, "that the author's name will be handed down to
posterity as one of the earliest and most indefatigable of our Oriental
scholars. Instead of confining himself, however, to mere translation,
he has filled his work with his own observations, which have been so
embodied in the text that Gibbon declares it impossible to distinguish
the translator from the original author." Preface p. vii.--M.]

and Latin languages, after it had passed from the Gaznevides to the
Seljukides, and other emirs of Asia and Egypt. Ducange (Dissertation
xvi. sur Joinville, p. 238-240. Gloss. Graec. et Latin.) labors to find
the title of Sultan in the ancient kingdom of Persia: but his proofs are
mere shadows; a proper name in the Themes of Constantine, (ii. 11,) an
anticipation of Zonaras, &c., and a medal of Kai Khosrou, not (as he
believes) the Sassanide of the vith, but the Seljukide of Iconium of the

[Footnote 5: Ferishta (apud Dow, Hist. of Hindostan, vol. i. p. 49)
mentions the report of a gun in the Indian army. But as I am slow in
believing this premature (A.D. 1008) use of artillery, I must desire to
scrutinize first the text, and then the authority of Ferishta, who
lived in the Mogul court in the last century. * Note: This passage is
differently written in the various manuscripts I have seen; and in some
the word tope (gun) has been written for nupth, (naphtha, and toofung)
(musket) for khudung, (arrow.) But no Persian or Arabic history speaks
of gunpowder before the time usually assigned for its invention, (A.D.
1317;) long after which, it was first applied to the purposes of war.

at the bottom of the page, "ten millions," which is the explanation of
the word "crore." Mr. Gibbon says rashly that the sum offered by the
Brahmins was ten millions sterling. Note to Mill's India, vol. ii. p.
222. Col. Briggs's translation is "a quantity of gold." The treasure
found in the temple, "perhaps in the image," according to Major Price's
authorities, was twenty millions of dinars of gold, above nine millions
sterling; but this was a hundred-fold the ransom offered by the
Brahmins. Price, vol. ii. p. 290.--M.]

From the paths of blood (and such is the history of nations) I cannot
refuse to turn aside to gather some flowers of science or virtue.
The name of Mahmud the Gaznevide is still venerable in the East: his
subjects enjoyed the blessings of prosperity and peace; his vices
were concealed by the veil of religion; and two familiar examples will
testify his justice and magnanimity.

I. As he sat in the Divan, an unhappy subject bowed before the throne to
accuse the insolence of a Turkish soldier who had driven him from his
house and bed. "Suspend your clamors," said Mahmud; "inform me of his
next visit, and ourself in person will judge and punish the offender."
The sultan followed his guide, invested the house with his guards, and
extinguishing the torches, pronounced the death of the criminal, who had
been seized in the act of rapine and adultery. After the execution of
his sentence, the lights were rekindled, Mahmud fell prostrate in
prayer, and rising from the ground, demanded some homely fare, which he
devoured with the voraciousness of hunger. The poor man, whose injury he
had avenged, was unable to suppress his astonishment and curiosity; and
the courteous monarch condescended to explain the motives of this
singular behavior. "I had reason to suspect that none, except one of my
sons, could dare to perpetrate such an outrage; and I extinguished the
lights, that my justice might be blind and inexorable. My prayer was a
thanksgiving on the discovery of the offender; and so painful was my
anxiety, that I had passed three days without food since the first
moment of your complaint."

II. The sultan of Gazna had declared war against the dynasty of the
Bowides, the sovereigns of the western Persia: he was disarmed by an
epistle of the sultana mother, and delayed his invasion till the manhood
of her son. [8] "During the life of my husband," said the artful regent,
"I was ever apprehensive of your ambition: he was a prince and a soldier
worthy of your arms. He is now no more his sceptre has passed to a woman
and a child, and you dare not attack their infancy and weakness. How
inglorious would be your conquest, how shameful your defeat! and yet the
event of war is in the hand of the Almighty." Avarice was the only
defect that tarnished the illustrious character of Mahmud; and never has
that passion been more richly satiated. [811] The Orientals exceed the
measure of credibility in the account of millions of gold and silver,
such as the avidity of man has never accumulated; in the magnitude of
pearls, diamonds, and rubies, such as have never been produced by the
workmanship of nature. [9] Yet the soil of Hindostan is impregnated with
precious minerals: her trade, in every age, has attracted the gold and
silver of the world; and her virgin spoils were rifled by the first of
the Mahometan conquerors. His behavior, in the last days of his life,
evinces the vanity of these possessions, so laboriously won, so
dangerously held, and so inevitably lost. He surveyed the vast and
various chambers of the treasury of Gazna, burst into tears, and again
closed the doors, without bestowing any portion of the wealth which he
could no longer hope to preserve. The following day he reviewed the
state of his military force; one hundred thousand foot, fifty-five
thousand horse, and thirteen hundred elephants of battle. [10] He again
wept the instability of human greatness; and his grief was imbittered by
the hostile progress of the Turkmans, whom he had introduced into the
heart of his Persian kingdom.

[Footnote 8: D'Herbelot, Bibliotheque Orientale, p. 527. Yet these
letters apothegms, &c., are rarely the language of the heart, or the
motives of public action.]

[Footnote 811: Compare Price, vol. ii. p. 295.--M]

[Footnote 9: For instance, a ruby of four hundred and fifty miskals,
(Dow, vol. i. p. 53,) or six pounds three ounces: the largest in the
treasury of Delhi weighed seventeen miskals, (Voyages de Tavernier,
partie ii. p. 280.) It is true, that in the East all colored stones are
calied rubies, (p. 355,) and that Tavernier saw three larger and more
precious among the jewels de notre grand roi, le plus puissant et plus
magnifique de tous les rois de la terre, (p. 376.)]

[Footnote 10: Dow, vol. i. p. 65. The sovereign of Kinoge is said to
have possessed 2500 elephants, (Abulfed. Geograph. tab. xv. p. 274.)
From these Indian stories, the reader may correct a note in my first
volume, (p. 245;) or from that note he may correct these stories.]

In the modern depopulation of Asia, the regular operation of government
and agriculture is confined to the neighborhood of cities; and the
distant country is abandoned to the pastoral tribes of Arabs, Curds, and
Turkmans. [11] Of the last-mentioned people, two considerable branches
extend on either side of the Caspian Sea: the western colony can muster
forty thousand soldiers; the eastern, less obvious to the traveller,
but more strong and populous, has increased to the number of one hundred
thousand families. In the midst of civilized nations, they preserve the
manners of the Scythian desert, remove their encampments with a change
of seasons, and feed their cattle among the ruins of palaces and
temples. Their flocks and herds are their only riches; their tents,
either black or white, according to the color of the banner, are covered
with felt, and of a circular form; their winter apparel is a sheep-skin;
a robe of cloth or cotton their summer garment: the features of the
men are harsh and ferocious; the countenance of their women is soft
and pleasing. Their wandering life maintains the spirit and exercise
of arms; they fight on horseback; and their courage is displayed in
frequent contests with each other and with their neighbors. For the
license of pasture they pay a slight tribute to the sovereign of the
land; but the domestic jurisdiction is in the hands of the chiefs and
elders. The first emigration of the Eastern Turkmans, the most ancient
of the race, may be ascribed to the tenth century of the Christian
aera. [12] In the decline of the caliphs, and the weakness of their
lieutenants, the barrier of the Jaxartes was often violated; in each
invasion, after the victory or retreat of their countrymen, some
wandering tribe, embracing the Mahometan faith, obtained a free
encampment in the spacious plains and pleasant climate of Transoxiana
and Carizme. The Turkish slaves who aspired to the throne encouraged
these emigrations which recruited their armies, awed their subjects
and rivals, and protected the frontier against the wilder natives of
Turkestan; and this policy was abused by Mahmud the Gaznevide beyond the
example of former times. He was admonished of his error by the chief of
the race of Seljuk, who dwelt in the territory of Bochara. The sultan
had inquired what supply of men he could furnish for military service.
"If you send," replied Ismael, "one of these arrows into our camp,
fifty thousand of your servants will mount on horseback."--"And if
that number," continued Mahmud, "should not be sufficient?"--"Send this
second arrow to the horde of Balik, and you will find fifty thousand
more."--"But," said the Gaznevide, dissembling his anxiety, "if I should
stand in need of the whole force of your kindred tribes?"--"Despatch my
bow," was the last reply of Ismael, "and as it is circulated around, the
summons will be obeyed by two hundred thousand horse." The apprehension
of such formidable friendship induced Mahmud to transport the most
obnoxious tribes into the heart of Chorasan, where they would be
separated from their brethren of the River Oxus, and enclosed on all
sides by the walls of obedient cities. But the face of the country was
an object of temptation rather than terror; and the vigor of government
was relaxed by the absence and death of the sultan of Gazna. The
shepherds were converted into robbers; the bands of robbers were
collected into an army of conquerors: as far as Ispahan and the Tigris,
Persia was afflicted by their predatory inroads; and the Turkmans were
not ashamed or afraid to measure their courage and numbers with the
proudest sovereigns of Asia. Massoud, the son and successor of Mahmud,
had too long neglected the advice of his wisest Omrahs. "Your enemies,"
they repeatedly urged, "were in their origin a swarm of ants; they are
now little snakes; and, unless they be instantly crushed, they will
acquire the venom and magnitude of serpents." After some alternatives
of truce and hostility, after the repulse or partial success of his
lieutenants, the sultan marched in person against the Turkmans, who
attacked him on all sides with barbarous shouts and irregular onset.
"Massoud," says the Persian historian, [13] "plunged singly to oppose
the torrent of gleaming arms, exhibiting such acts of gigantic force and
valor as never king had before displayed. A few of his friends, roused
by his words and actions, and that innate honor which inspires the
brave, seconded their lord so well, that wheresoever he turned his fatal
sword, the enemies were mowed down, or retreated before him. But now,
when victory seemed to blow on his standard, misfortune was active
behind it; for when he looked round, be beheld almost his whole army,
excepting that body he commanded in person, devouring the paths of
flight." The Gaznevide was abandoned by the cowardice or treachery of
some generals of Turkish race; and this memorable day of Zendecan [14]
founded in Persia the dynasty of the shepherd kings. [15]

[Footnote 11: See a just and natural picture of these pastoral manners,
in the history of William archbishop of Tyre, (l. i. c. vii. in the
Gesta Dei per Francos, p. 633, 634,) and a valuable note by the editor
of the Histoire Genealogique des Tatars, p. 535-538.]

of the Seljukians, may be traced in the laborious History of the Huns,

799-802, 897-901,) Elmacin, (Hist. Saracen. p. 321-333,) and
Abulpharagius, (Dynast. p. 221, 222.)]

[Footnote 13: Dow, Hist. of Hindostan, vol. i. p. 89, 95-98. I have
copied this passage as a specimen of the Persian manner; but I suspect
that, by some odd fatality, the style of Ferishta has been improved by
that of Ossian. * Note: Gibbon's conjecture was well founded. Compare
the more sober and genuine version of Col. Briggs, vol. i. p. 110.-M.]

[Footnote 14: The Zendekan of D'Herbelot, (p. 1028,) the Dindaka of Dow
(vol. i. p. 97,) is probably the Dandanekan of Abulfeda, (Geograph. p.
345, Reiske,) a small town of Chorasan, two days' journey from Maru, and
renowned through the East for the production and manufacture of cotton.]

[Footnote 15: The Byzantine historians (Cedrenus, tom. ii. p. 766, 766,
Zonaras tom. ii. p. 255, Nicephorus Bryennius, p. 21) have confounded,
in this revolution, the truth of time and place, of names and persons,
of causes and events. The ignorance and errors of these Greeks (which
I shall not stop to unravel) may inspire some distrust of the story of
Cyaxares and Cyrus, as it is told by their most eloquent predecessor.]

The victorious Turkmans immediately proceeded to the election of a king;
and, if the probable tale of a Latin historian [16] deserves any credit,
they determined by lot the choice of their new master. A number of
arrows were successively inscribed with the name of a tribe, a family,
and a candidate; they were drawn from the bundle by the hand of a child;
and the important prize was obtained by Togrul Beg, the son of Michael
the son of Seljuk, whose surname was immortalized in the greatness of
his posterity. The sultan Mahmud, who valued himself on his skill in
national genealogy, professed his ignorance of the family of Seljuk;
yet the father of that race appears to have been a chief of power and
renown. [17] For a daring intrusion into the harem of his prince. Seljuk
was banished from Turkestan: with a numerous tribe of his friends
and vassals, he passed the Jaxartes, encamped in the neighborhood of
Samarcand, embraced the religion of Mahomet, and acquired the crown of
martyrdom in a war against the infidels. His age, of a hundred and seven
years, surpassed the life of his son, and Seljuk adopted the care of
his two grandsons, Togrul and Jaafar; the eldest of whom, at the age of
forty-five, was invested with the title of Sultan, in the royal city of
Nishabur. The blind determination of chance was justified by the virtues
of the successful candidate. It would be superfluous to praise the valor
of a Turk; and the ambition of Togrul [18] was equal to his valor. By
his arms, the Gasnevides were expelled from the eastern kingdoms of
Persia, and gradually driven to the banks of the Indus, in search of a
softer and more wealthy conquest. In the West he annihilated the dynasty
of the Bowides; and the sceptre of Irak passed from the Persian to the
Turkish nation. The princes who had felt, or who feared, the Seljukian
arrows, bowed their heads in the dust; by the conquest of Aderbijan, or
Media, he approached the Roman confines; and the shepherd presumed to
despatch an ambassador, or herald, to demand the tribute and obedience
of the emperor of Constantinople. [19] In his own dominions, Togrul
was the father of his soldiers and people; by a firm and equal
administration, Persia was relieved from the evils of anarchy; and
the same hands which had been imbrued in blood became the guardians
of justice and the public peace. The more rustic, perhaps the wisest,
portion of the Turkmans [20] continued to dwell in the tents of their
ancestors; and, from the Oxus to the Euphrates, these military colonies
were protected and propagated by their native princes. But the Turks of
the court and city were refined by business and softened by pleasure:
they imitated the dress, language, and manners of Persia; and the royal
palaces of Nishabur and Rei displayed the order and magnificence of a
great monarchy. The most deserving of the Arabians and Persians were
promoted to the honors of the state; and the whole body of the Turkish
nation embraced, with fervor and sincerity, the religion of Mahomet. The
northern swarms of Barbarians, who overspread both Europe and Asia, have
been irreconcilably separated by the consequences of a similar conduct.
Among the Moslems, as among the Christians, their vague and local
traditions have yielded to the reason and authority of the prevailing
system, to the fame of antiquity, and the consent of nations. But
the triumph of the Koran is more pure and meritorious, as it was not
assisted by any visible splendor of worship which might allure the
Pagans by some resemblance of idolatry. The first of the Seljukian
sultans was conspicuous by his zeal and faith: each day he repeated the
five prayers which are enjoined to the true believers; of each week, the
two first days were consecrated by an extraordinary fast; and in
every city a mosch was completed, before Togrul presumed to lay the
foundations of a palace. [21]

[Footnote 17: D'Herbelot, p. 801. Yet after the fortune of his
posterity, Seljuk became the thirty-fourth in lineal descent from the
great Afrasiab, emperor of Touran, (p. 800.) The Tartar pedigree of the
house of Zingis gave a different cast to flattery and fable; and the
historian Mirkhond derives the Seljukides from Alankavah, the virgin
mother, (p. 801, col. 2.) If they be the same as the Zalzuts of
Abulghazi Bahadur Kahn, (Hist. Genealogique, p. 148,) we quote in
their favor the most weighty evidence of a Tartar prince himself, the
descendant of Zingis, Alankavah, or Alancu, and Oguz Khan.]

the vicar and successor of the caliph.]

[Footnote 20: From William of Tyre I have borrowed this distinction of
Turks and Turkmans, which at least is popular and convenient. The names
are the same, and the addition of man is of the same import in the
Persic and Teutonic idioms. Few critics will adopt the etymology of
James de Vitry, (Hist. Hierosol. l. i. c. 11 p. 1061,) of Turcomani,

With the belief of the Koran, the son of Seljuk imbibed a lively
reverence for the successor of the prophet. But that sublime character
was still disputed by the caliphs of Bagdad and Egypt, and each of the
rivals was solicitous to prove his title in the judgment of the strong,
though illiterate Barbarians. Mahmud the Gaznevide had declared himself
in favor of the line of Abbas; and had treated with indignity the
robe of honor which was presented by the Fatimite ambassador. Yet
the ungrateful Hashemite had changed with the change of fortune; he
applauded the victory of Zendecan, and named the Seljukian sultan
his temporal vicegerent over the Moslem world. As Togrul executed and
enlarged this important trust, he was called to the deliverance of the
caliph Cayem, and obeyed the holy summons, which gave a new kingdom to
his arms. [22] In the palace of Bagdad, the commander of the faithful
still slumbered, a venerable phantom. His servant or master, the prince
of the Bowides, could no longer protect him from the insolence of meaner
tyrants; and the Euphrates and Tigris were oppressed by the revolt of
the Turkish and Arabian emirs. The presence of a conqueror was implored
as a blessing; and the transient mischiefs of fire and sword were
excused as the sharp but salutary remedies which alone could restore the
health of the republic. At the head of an irresistible force, the sultan
of Persia marched from Hamadan: the proud were crushed, the prostrate
were spared; the prince of the Bowides disappeared; the heads of the
most obstinate rebels were laid at the feet of Togrul; and he inflicted
a lesson of obedience on the people of Mosul and Bagdad. After the
chastisement of the guilty, and the restoration of peace, the royal
shepherd accepted the reward of his labors; and a solemn comedy
represented the triumph of religious prejudice over Barbarian power.
[23] The Turkish sultan embarked on the Tigris, landed at the gate of
Racca, and made his public entry on horseback. At the palace-gate he
respectfully dismounted, and walked on foot, preceded by his emirs
without arms. The caliph was seated behind his black veil: the black
garment of the Abbassides was cast over his shoulders, and he held in
his hand the staff of the apostle of God. The conqueror of the East
kissed the ground, stood some time in a modest posture, and was led
towards the throne by the vizier and interpreter. After Togrul had
seated himself on another throne, his commission was publicly read,
which declared him the temporal lieutenant of the vicar of the prophet.
He was successively invested with seven robes of honor, and presented
with seven slaves, the natives of the seven climates of the Arabian
empire. His mystic veil was perfumed with musk; two crowns [231] were
placed on his head; two cimeters were girded to his side, as the symbols
of a double reign over the East and West. After this inauguration, the
sultan was prevented from prostrating himself a second time; but he
twice kissed the hand of the commander of the faithful, and his titles
were proclaimed by the voice of heralds and the applause of the Moslems.
In a second visit to Bagdad, the Seljukian prince again rescued the
caliph from his enemies and devoutly, on foot, led the bridle of his
mule from the prison to the palace. Their alliance was cemented by the
marriage of Togrul's sister with the successor of the prophet. Without
reluctance he had introduced a Turkish virgin into his harem; but Cayem
proudly refused his daughter to the sultan, disdained to mingle the
blood of the Hashemites with the blood of a Scythian shepherd; and
protracted the negotiation many months, till the gradual diminution of
his revenue admonished him that he was still in the hands of a master.
The royal nuptials were followed by the death of Togrul himself; [24]
as he left no children, his nephew Alp Arslan succeeded to the title
and prerogatives of sultan; and his name, after that of the caliph, was
pronounced in the public prayers of the Moslems. Yet in this revolution,
the Abbassides acquired a larger measure of liberty and power. On the
throne of Asia, the Turkish monarchs were less jealous of the domestic
administration of Bagdad; and the commanders of the faithful were
relieved from the ignominious vexations to which they had been exposed
by the presence and poverty of the Persian dynasty.
