## Chapter LI: Conquests By The Arabs.--Part I.

     The Conquest Of Persia, Syria, Egypt, Africa, And Spain, By
     The Arabs Or Saracens.--Empire Of The Caliphs, Or Successors
     Of Mahomet.--State Of The Christians, &c., Under Their
     Government.

The revolution of Arabia had not changed the character of the Arabs: the
death of Mahomet was the signal of independence; and the hasty structure
of his power and religion tottered to its foundations. A small and
faithful band of his primitive disciples had listened to his eloquence,
and shared his distress; had fled with the apostle from the persecution
of Mecca, or had received the fugitive in the walls of Medina. The
increasing myriads, who acknowledged Mahomet as their king and prophet,
had been compelled by his arms, or allured by his prosperity. The
polytheists were confounded by the simple idea of a solitary and
invisible God; the pride of the Christians and Jews disdained the
yoke of a mortal and contemporary legislator. The habits of faith and
obedience were not sufficiently confirmed; and many of the new converts
regretted the venerable antiquity of the law of Moses, or the rites
and mysteries of the Catholic church; or the idols, the sacrifices, the
joyous festivals, of their Pagan ancestors. The jarring interests and
hereditary feuds of the Arabian tribes had not yet coalesced in a system
of union and subordination; and the Barbarians were impatient of the
mildest and most salutary laws that curbed their passions, or violated
their customs. They submitted with reluctance to the religious precepts
of the Koran, the abstinence from wine, the fast of the Ramadan, and the
daily repetition of five prayers; and the alms and tithes, which were
collected for the treasury of Medina, could be distinguished only by
a name from the payment of a perpetual and ignominious tribute. The
example of Mahomet had excited a spirit of fanaticism or imposture,
and several of his rivals presumed to imitate the conduct, and defy
the authority, of the living prophet. At the head of the fugitives
and auxiliaries, the first caliph was reduced to the cities of Mecca,
Medina, and Tayef; and perhaps the Koreish would have restored the
idols of the Caaba, if their levity had not been checked by a seasonable
reproof. "Ye men of Mecca, will ye be the last to embrace, and the
first to abandon, the religion of Islam?" After exhorting the Moslems
to confide in the aid of God and his apostle, Abubeker resolved, by a
vigorous attack, to prevent the junction of the rebels. The women
and children were safely lodged in the cavities of the mountains: the
warriors, marching under eleven banners, diffused the terror of their
arms; and the appearance of a military force revived and confirmed the
loyalty of the faithful. The inconstant tribes accepted, with humble
repentance, the duties of prayer, and fasting, and alms; and, after
some examples of success and severity, the most daring apostates fell
prostrate before the sword of the Lord and of Caled. In the fertile
province of Yemanah, [1] between the Red Sea and the Gulf of Persia,
in a city not inferior to Medina itself, a powerful chief (his name
was Moseilama) had assumed the character of a prophet, and the tribe of
Hanifa listened to his voice. A female prophetess [1111] was attracted
by his reputation; the decencies of words and actions were spurned by
these favorites of Heaven; [2] and they employed several days in mystic
and amorous converse. An obscure sentence of his Koran, or book, is yet
extant; [3] and in the pride of his mission, Moseilama condescended to
offer a partition of the earth. The proposal was answered by Mahomet
with contempt; but the rapid progress of the impostor awakened the
fears of his successor: forty thousand Moslems were assembled under the
standard of Caled; and the existence of their faith was resigned to
the event of a decisive battle. [3111] In the first action they
were repulsed by the loss of twelve hundred men; but the skill and
perseverance of their general prevailed; their defeat was avenged by the
slaughter of ten thousand infidels; and Moseilama himself was pierced by
an Aethiopian slave with the same javelin which had mortally wounded
the uncle of Mahomet. The various rebels of Arabia without a chief or
a cause, were speedily suppressed by the power and discipline of
the rising monarchy; and the whole nation again professed, and more
steadfastly held, the religion of the Koran. The ambition of the caliphs
provided an immediate exercise for the restless spirit of the Saracens:
their valor was united in the prosecution of a holy war; and their
enthusiasm was equally confirmed by opposition and victory.

[Footnote 1: See the description of the city and country of Al Yamanah,
in Abulfeda, Descript. Arabiae, p. 60, 61. In the xiiith century, there
were some ruins, and a few palms; but in the present century, the same
ground is occupied by the visions and arms of a modern prophet, whose
tenets are imperfectly known, (Niebuhr, Description de l'Arabie, p.
296-302.)]

[Footnote 1111: This extraordinary woman was a Christian; she was at
the head of a numerous and flourishing sect; Moseilama professed to
recognize her inspiration. In a personal interview he proposed their
marriage and the union of their sects. The handsome person, the
impassioned eloquence, and the arts of Moseilama, triumphed over the
virtue of the prophetesa who was rejected with scorn by her lover, and
by her notorious unchastity ost her influence with her own followers.
Gibbon, with that propensity too common, especially in his later
volumes, has selected only the grosser part of this singular
adventure.--M.]

[Footnote 2: The first salutation may be transcribed, but cannot be
translated. It was thus that Moseilama said or sung:--

 Surge tandem itaque strenue permolenda; nam stratus tibi thorus est.
 Aut in propatulo tentorio si velis, aut in abditiore cubiculo si malis;
 Aut supinam te humi exporrectam fustigabo, si velis,
 Aut si malis manibus pedibusque nixam.
 Aut si velis ejus (Priapi) gemino triente aut si malis totus veniam.
 Imo, totus venito, O Apostole Dei, clamabat foemina.
 Id ipsum, dicebat
 Moseilama, mihi quoque suggessit Deus.

The prophetess Segjah, after the fall of her lover, returned to
idolatry; but under the reign of Moawiyah, she became a Mussulman, and
died at Bassora, (Abulfeda, Annal. vers. Reiske, p. 63.)]

[Footnote 3: See this text, which demonstrates a God from the work of
generation, in Abulpharagius (Specimen Hist. Arabum, p. 13, and Dynast.
p. 103) and Abulfeda, (Annal. p. 63.)]

[Footnote 3111: Compare a long account of this battle in Price, p.
42.--M.]

From the rapid conquests of the Saracens a presumption will naturally
arise, that the caliphs [311] commanded in person the armies of the
faithful, and sought the crown of martyrdom in the foremost ranks of
the battle. The courage of Abubeker, [4] Omar, [5] and Othman, [6] had
indeed been tried in the persecution and wars of the prophet; and the
personal assurance of paradise must have taught them to despise the
pleasures and dangers of the present world. But they ascended the
throne in a venerable or mature age; and esteemed the domestic cares of
religion and justice the most important duties of a sovereign.
Except the presence of Omar at the siege of Jerusalem, their longest
expeditions were the frequent pilgrimage from Medina to Mecca; and they
calmly received the tidings of victory as they prayed or preached before
the sepulchre of the prophet. The austere and frugal measure of
their lives was the effect of virtue or habit, and the pride of their
simplicity insulted the vain magnificence of the kings of the earth.
When Abubeker assumed the office of caliph, he enjoined his daughter
Ayesha to take a strict account of his private patrimony, that it might
be evident whether he were enriched or impoverished by the service of
the state. He thought himself entitled to a stipend of three pieces
of gold, with the sufficient maintenance of a single camel and a black
slave; but on the Friday of each week he distributed the residue of his
own and the public money, first to the most worthy, and then to the most
indigent, of the Moslems. The remains of his wealth, a coarse garment,
and five pieces of gold, were delivered to his successor, who lamented
with a modest sigh his own inability to equal such an admirable model.
Yet the abstinence and humility of Omar were not inferior to the virtues
of Abubeker: his food consisted of barley bread or dates; his drink was
water; he preached in a gown that was torn or tattered in twelve places;
and the Persian satrap, who paid his homage to the conqueror, found him
asleep among the beggars on the steps of the mosch of Medina. Oeeconomy
is the source of liberality, and the increase of the revenue enabled
Omar to establish a just and perpetual reward for the past and present
services of the faithful. Careless of his own emolument, he assigned to
Abbas, the uncle of the prophet, the first and most ample allowance of
twenty-five thousand drachms or pieces of silver. Five thousand were
allotted to each of the aged warriors, the relics of the field of Beder;
and the last and meanest of the companions of Mahomet was distinguished
by the annual reward of three thousand pieces. One thousand was the
stipend of the veterans who had fought in the first battles against the
Greeks and Persians; and the decreasing pay, as low as fifty pieces
of silver, was adapted to the respective merit and seniority of the
soldiers of Omar. Under his reign, and that of his predecessor, the
conquerors of the East were the trusty servants of God and the people;
the mass of the public treasure was consecrated to the expenses of
peace and war; a prudent mixture of justice and bounty maintained the
discipline of the Saracens, and they united, by a rare felicity, the
despatch and execution of despotism with the equal and frugal maxims of
a republican government. The heroic courage of Ali, [7] the consummate
prudence of Moawiyah, [8] excited the emulation of their subjects; and
the talents which had been exercised in the school of civil discord
were more usefully applied to propagate the faith and dominion of
the prophet. In the sloth and vanity of the palace of Damascus, the
succeeding princes of the house of Ommiyah were alike destitute of the
qualifications of statesmen and of saints. [9] Yet the spoils of unknown
nations were continually laid at the foot of their throne, and the
uniform ascent of the Arabian greatness must be ascribed to the spirit
of the nation rather than the abilities of their chiefs. A large
deduction must be allowed for the weakness of their enemies. The birth
of Mahomet was fortunately placed in the most degenerate and disorderly
period of the Persians, the Romans, and the Barbarians of Europe: the
empires of Trajan, or even of Constantine or Charlemagne, would
have repelled the assault of the naked Saracens, and the torrent of
fanaticism might have been obscurely lost in the sands of Arabia.

In the victorious days of the Roman republic, it had been the aim of
the senate to confine their councils and legions to a single war,
and completely to suppress a first enemy before they provoked the
hostilities of a second. These timid maxims of policy were disdained
by the magnanimity or enthusiasm of the Arabian caliphs. With the same
vigor and success they invaded the successors of Augustus and those of
Artaxerxes; and the rival monarchies at the same instant became the prey
of an enemy whom they had been so long accustomed to despise. In the
ten years of the administration of Omar, the Saracens reduced to his
obedience thirty-six thousand cities or castles, destroyed four thousand
churches or temples of the unbelievers, and edified fourteen hundred
moschs for the exercise of the religion of Mahomet. One hundred years
after his flight from Mecca, the arms and the reign of his successors
extended from India to the Atlantic Ocean, over the various and distant
provinces, which may be comprised under the names of, I. Persia;
II. Syria; III. Egypt; IV. Africa; and, V. Spain. Under this general
division, I shall proceed to unfold these memorable transactions;
despatching with brevity the remote and less interesting conquests of
the East, and reserving a fuller narrative for those domestic countries
which had been included within the pale of the Roman empire. Yet I
must excuse my own defects by a just complaint of the blindness and
insufficiency of my guides. The Greeks, so loquacious in controversy,
have not been anxious to celebrate the triumphs of their enemies. [10]
After a century of ignorance, the first annals of the Mussulmans were
collected in a great measure from the voice of tradition. [11] Among
the numerous productions of Arabic and Persian literature, [12] our
interpreters have selected the imperfect sketches of a more recent
age. [13] The art and genius of history have ever been unknown to the
Asiatics; [14] they are ignorant of the laws of criticism; and our
monkish chronicle of the same period may be compared to their most
popular works, which are never vivified by the spirit of philosophy and
freedom.

The Oriental library of a Frenchman [15] would instruct the most learned
mufti of the East; and perhaps the Arabs might not find in a single
historian so clear and comprehensive a narrative of their own exploits
as that which will be deduced in the ensuing sheets.

[Footnote 10: For the viith and viiith century, we have scarcely any
original evidence of the Byzantine historians, except the chronicles of
Theophanes (Theophanis Confessoris Chronographia, Gr. et Lat. cum notis
Jacobi Goar. Paris, 1665, in folio) and the Abridgment of Nicephorus,
(Nicephori Patriarchae C. P. Breviarium Historicum, Gr. et Lat. Paris,
1648, in folio,) who both lived in the beginning of the ixth century,
(see Hanckius de Scriptor. Byzant. p. 200-246.) Their contemporary,
Photius, does not seem to be more opulent. After praising the style of
Nicephorus, he adds, and only complains of his extreme brevity, (Phot.
Bibliot. Cod. lxvi. p. 100.) Some additions may be gleaned from the more
recent histories of Cedrenus and Zonaras of the xiith century.]

[Footnote 11: Tabari, or Al Tabari, a native of Taborestan, a famous
Imam of Bagdad, and the Livy of the Arabians, finished his general
history in the year of the Hegira 302, (A.D. 914.) At the request of his
friends, he reduced a work of 30,000 sheets to a more reasonable
size. But his Arabic original is known only by the Persian and Turkish
versions. The Saracenic history of Ebn Amid, or Elmacin, is said to be
an abridgment of the great Tabari, (Ockley's Hist. of the Saracens, vol.
ii. preface, p. xxxix. and list of authors, D'Herbelot, p. 866, 870,
1014.)]

[Footnote 12: Besides the list of authors framed by Prideaux, (Life of
Mahomet, p. 179-189,) Ockley, (at the end of his second volume,) and
Petit de la Croix, (Hist. de Gengiscan, p. 525-550,) we find in the
Bibliotheque Orientale Tarikh, a catalogue of two or three hundred
histories or chronicles of the East, of which not more than three or
four are older than Tabari. A lively sketch of Oriental literature is
given by Reiske, (in his Prodidagmata ad Hagji Chalifae librum
memorialem ad calcem Abulfedae Tabulae Syriae, Lipsiae, 1776;) but his
project and the French version of Petit de la Croix (Hist. de Timur Bec,
tom. i. preface, p. xlv.) have fallen to the ground.]

[Footnote 13: The particular historians and geographers will be
occasionally introduced. The four following titles represent the Annals
which have guided me in this general narrative. 1. Annales Eutychii,
Patriarchoe Alexandrini, ab Edwardo Pocockio, Oxon. 1656, 2 vols. in
4to. A pompous edition of an indifferent author, translated by Pocock
to gratify the Presbyterian prejudices of his friend Selden. 2. Historia
Saracenica Georgii Elmacini, opera et studio Thomae Erpenii, in 4to.,
Lugd. Batavorum, 1625. He is said to have hastily translated a corrupt
Ms., and his version is often deficient in style and sense. 3. Historia
compendiosa Dynastiarum a Gregorio Abulpharagio, interprete Edwardo
Pocockio, in 4to., Oxon. 1663. More useful for the literary than the
civil history of the East. 4. Abulfedoe Annales Moslemici ad Ann.
Hegiroe ccccvi. a Jo. Jac. Reiske, in 4to., Lipsioe, 1754. The best of
our chronicles, both for the original and version, yet how far below the
name of Abulfeda! We know that he wrote at Hamah in the xivth century.
The three former were Christians of the xth, xiith, and xiiith
centuries; the two first, natives of Egypt; a Melchite patriarch, and a
Jacobite scribe.]

[Footnote 14: M. D. Guignes (Hist. des Huns, tom. i. pref. p. xix. xx.)
has characterized, with truth and knowledge, the two sorts of Arabian
historians--the dry annalist, and the tumid and flowery orator.]

[Footnote 15: Bibliotheque Orientale, par M. D'Herbelot, in folio,
Paris, 1697. For the character of the respectable author, consult his
friend Thevenot, (Voyages du Levant, part i. chap. 1.) His work is an
agreeable miscellany, which must gratify every taste; but I never can
digest the alphabetical order; and I find him more satisfactory in the
Persian than the Arabic history. The recent supplement from the papers
of Mm. Visdelou, and Galland, (in folio, La Haye, 1779,) is of a
different cast, a medley of tales, proverbs, and Chinese antiquities.]

I. In the first year of the first caliph, his lieutenant Caled, the
Sword of God, and the scourge of the infidels, advanced to the banks of
the Euphrates, and reduced the cities of Anbar and Hira. Westward of the
ruins of Babylon, a tribe of sedentary Arabs had fixed themselves on the
verge of the desert; and Hira was the seat of a race of kings who had
embraced the Christian religion, and reigned above six hundred years
under the shadow of the throne of Persia. [16] The last of the Mondars
[1611] was defeated and slain by Caled; his son was sent a captive to
Medina; his nobles bowed before the successor of the prophet; the people
was tempted by the example and success of their countrymen; and the
caliph accepted as the first-fruits of foreign conquest an annual
tribute of seventy thousand pieces of gold. The conquerors, and even
their historians, were astonished by the dawn of their future greatness:
"In the same year," says Elmacin, "Caled fought many signal battles: an
immense multitude of the infidels was slaughtered; and spoils infinite
and innumerable were acquired by the victorious Moslems." [17] But the
invincible Caled was soon transferred to the Syrian war: the invasion
of the Persian frontier was conducted by less active or less prudent
commanders: the Saracens were repulsed with loss in the passage of
the Euphrates; and, though they chastised the insolent pursuit of the
Magians, their remaining forces still hovered in the desert of Babylon.
[1711]

[Footnote 16: Pocock will explain the chronology, (Specimen Hist.
Arabum, p. 66-74,) and D'Anville the geography, (l'Euphrate, et le
Tigre, p. 125,) of the dynasty of the Almondars. The English scholar
understood more Arabic than the mufti of Aleppo, (Ockley, vol. ii. p.
34: ) the French geographer is equally at home in every age and every
climate of the world.]

vicerunt Muslimi, et infidelium immensa multitudine occisa spolia
infinita et innumera sunt nacti, (Hist. Saracenica, p. 20.) The
Christian annalist slides into the national and compendious term of
infidels, and I often adopt (I hope without scandal) this characteristic
mode of expression.]

[Footnote 1711: Compare throughout Malcolm, vol. ii. p. 136.--M.]

The indignation and fears of the Persians suspended for a moment their
intestine divisions. By the unanimous sentence of the priests and
nobles, their queen Arzema was deposed; the sixth of the transient
usurpers, who had arisen and vanished in three or four years since the
death of Chosroes, and the retreat of Heraclius. Her tiara was placed
on the head of Yezdegerd, the grandson of Chosroes; and the same aera,
which coincides with an astronomical period, [18] has recorded the fall
of the Sassanian dynasty and the religion of Zoroaster. [19] The youth
and inexperience of the prince (he was only fifteen years of age)
declined a perilous encounter: the royal standard was delivered into the
hands of his general Rustam; and a remnant of thirty thousand regular
troops was swelled in truth, or in opinion, to one hundred and twenty
thousand subjects, or allies, of the great king. The Moslems, whose
numbers were reenforced from twelve to thirty thousand, had pitched
their camp in the plains of Cadesia: [20] and their line, though it
consisted of fewer men, could produce more soldiers, than the unwieldy
host of the infidels. I shall here observe, what I must often repeat,
that the charge of the Arabs was not, like that of the Greeks and
Romans, the effort of a firm and compact infantry: their military force
was chiefly formed of cavalry and archers; and the engagement, which
was often interrupted and often renewed by single combats and flying
skirmishes, might be protracted without any decisive event to the
continuance of several days. The periods of the battle of Cadesia
were distinguished by their peculiar appellations. The first, from
the well-timed appearance of six thousand of the Syrian brethren, was
denominated the day of succor. The day of concussion might express
the disorder of one, or perhaps of both, of the contending armies. The
third, a nocturnal tumult, received the whimsical name of the night
of barking, from the discordant clamors, which were compared to
the inarticulate sounds of the fiercest animals. The morning of the
succeeding day [2011] determined the fate of Persia; and a seasonable
whirlwind drove a cloud of dust against the faces of the unbelievers.
The clangor of arms was reechoed to the tent of Rustam, who, far
unlike the ancient hero of his name, was gently reclining in a cool and
tranquil shade, amidst the baggage of his camp, and the train of mules
that were laden with gold and silver. On the sound of danger he started
from his couch; but his flight was overtaken by a valiant Arab, who
caught him by the foot, struck off his head, hoisted it on a lance, and
instantly returning to the field of battle, carried slaughter and dismay
among the thickest ranks of the Persians. The Saracens confess a loss
of seven thousand five hundred men; [2012] and the battle of Cadesia is
justly described by the epithets of obstinate and atrocious. [21] The
standard of the monarchy was overthrown and captured in the field--a
leathern apron of a blacksmith, who in ancient times had arisen the
deliverer of Persia; but this badge of heroic poverty was disguised,
and almost concealed, by a profusion of precious gems. [22] After this
victory, the wealthy province of Irak, or Assyria, submitted to
the caliph, and his conquests were firmly established by the speedy
foundation of Bassora, [23] a place which ever commands the trade and
navigation of the Persians. As the distance of fourscore miles from
the Gulf, the Euphrates and Tigris unite in a broad and direct current,
which is aptly styled the river of the Arabs. In the midway, between the
junction and the mouth of these famous streams, the new settlement was
planted on the western bank: the first colony was composed of eight
hundred Moslems; but the influence of the situation soon reared a
flourishing and populous capital. The air, though excessively hot, is
pure and healthy: the meadows are filled with palm-trees and cattle; and
one of the adjacent valleys has been celebrated among the four paradises
or gardens of Asia. Under the first caliphs the jurisdiction of this
Arabian colony extended over the southern provinces of Persia: the city
has been sanctified by the tombs of the companions and martyrs; and the
vessels of Europe still frequent the port of Bassora, as a convenient
station and passage of the Indian trade.

[Footnote 18: A cycle of 120 years, the end of which an intercalary
month of 30 days supplied the use of our Bissextile, and restored the
integrity of the solar year. In a great revolution of 1440 years this
intercalation was successively removed from the first to the twelfth
month; but Hyde and Freret are involved in a profound controversy,
whether the twelve, or only eight of these changes were accomplished
before the aera of Yezdegerd, which is unanimously fixed to the 16th
of June, A.D. 632. How laboriously does the curious spirit of Europe
explore the darkest and most distant antiquities! (Hyde de Religione
Persarum, c. 14-18, p. 181-211. Freret in the Mem. de l'Academie des
Inscriptions, tom. xvi. p. 233-267.)]

[Footnote 19: Nine days after the death of Mahomet (7th June, A.D. 632)
we find the aera of Yezdegerd, (16th June, A.D. 632,) and his accession
cannot be postponed beyond the end of the first year. His predecessors
could not therefore resist the arms of the caliph Omar; and these
unquestionable dates overthrow the thoughtless chronology of
Abulpharagius. See Ockley's Hist. of the Saracens, vol. i. p. 130. *
Note: The Rezont Uzzuffa (Price, p. 105) has a strange account of an
embassy to Yezdegerd. The Oriental historians take great delight in
these embassies, which give them an opportunity of displaying their
Asiatic eloquence--M.]
