     The Bulgarians.--Origin, Migrations, And Settlement Of The
     Hungarians.--Their Inroads In The East And West.--The
     Monarchy Of Russia.--Geography And Trade.--Wars Of The
     Russians Against The Greek Empire.--Conversion Of The
     Barbarians.

Under the reign of Constantine the grandson of Heraclius, the ancient
barrier of the Danube, so often violated and so often restored, was
irretrievably swept away by a new deluge of Barbarians. Their progress
was favored by the caliphs, their unknown and accidental auxiliaries:
the Roman legions were occupied in Asia; and after the loss of Syria,
Egypt, and Africa, the Caesars were twice reduced to the danger and
disgrace of defending their capital against the Saracens. If, in the
account of this interesting people, I have deviated from the strict and
original line of my undertaking, the merit of the subject will hide my
transgression, or solicit my excuse. In the East, in the West, in war,
in religion, in science, in their prosperity, and in their decay, the
Arabians press themselves on our curiosity: the first overthrow of the
church and empire of the Greeks may be imputed to their arms; and the
disciples of Mahomet still hold the civil and religious sceptre of the
Oriental world. But the same labor would be unworthily bestowed on the
swarms of savages, who, between the seventh and the twelfth century,
descended from the plains of Scythia, in transient inroad or perpetual
emigration. [1] Their names are uncouth, their origins doubtful, their
actions obscure, their superstition was blind, their valor brutal, and
the uniformity of their public and private lives was neither softened
by innocence nor refined by policy. The majesty of the Byzantine throne
repelled and survived their disorderly attacks; the greater part of
these Barbarians has disappeared without leaving any memorial of their
existence, and the despicable remnant continues, and may long continue,
to groan under the dominion of a foreign tyrant. From the antiquities
of, I. Bulgarians, II. Hungarians, and, III. Russians, I shall content
myself with selecting such facts as yet deserve to be remembered. The
conquests of the, IV. Normans, and the monarchy of the, V. Turks, will
naturally terminate in the memorable Crusades to the Holy Land, and the
double fall of the city and empire of Constantine.

[Footnote 1: All the passages of the Byzantine history which relate to
the Barbarians are compiled, methodized, and transcribed, in a Latin
version, by the laborious John Gotthelf Stritter, in his "Memoriae
Populorum, ad Danubium, Pontum Euxinum, Paludem Maeotidem, Caucasum,
Mare Caspium, et inde Magis ad Septemtriones incolentium." Petropoli,
1771-1779; in four tomes, or six volumes, in 4to. But the fashion has
not enhanced the price of these raw materials.]

I. In his march to Italy, Theodoric [2] the Ostrogoth had trampled on
the arms of the Bulgarians. After this defeat, the name and the nation
are lost during a century and a half; and it may be suspected that the
same or a similar appellation was revived by strange colonies from the
Borysthenes, the Tanais, or the Volga. A king of the ancient Bulgaria,
bequeathed to his five sons a last lesson of moderation and concord.
It was received as youth has ever received the counsels of age and
experience: the five princes buried their father; divided his subjects
and cattle; forgot his advice; separated from each other; and wandered
in quest of fortune till we find the most adventurous in the heart of
Italy, under the protection of the exarch of Ravenna. [4] But the stream
of emigration was directed or impelled towards the capital. The modern
Bulgaria, along the southern banks of the Danube, was stamped with
the name and image which it has retained to the present hour: the new
conquerors successively acquired, by war or treaty, the Roman provinces
of Dardania, Thessaly, and the two Epirus; [5] the ecclesiastical
supremacy was translated from the native city of Justinian; and, in
their prosperous age, the obscure town of Lychnidus, or Achrida,
was honored with the throne of a king and a patriarch. [6] The
unquestionable evidence of language attests the descent of the
Bulgarians from the original stock of the Sclavonian, or more properly
Slavonian, race; [7] and the kindred bands of Servians, Bosnians,
Rascians, Croatians, Walachians, [8] &c., followed either the standard
or the example of the leading tribe. From the Euxine to the Adriatic, in
the state of captives, or subjects, or allies, or enemies, of the Greek
empire, they overspread the land; and the national appellation of the
slaves [9] has been degraded by chance or malice from the signification
of glory to that of servitude. [10] Among these colonies, the
Chrobatians, [11] or Croats, who now attend the motions of an Austrian
army, are the descendants of a mighty people, the conquerors and
sovereigns of Dalmatia. The maritime cities, and of these the infant
republic of Ragusa, implored the aid and instructions of the Byzantine
court: they were advised by the magnanimous Basil to reserve a small
acknowledgment of their fidelity to the Roman empire, and to appease,
by an annual tribute, the wrath of these irresistible Barbarians. The
kingdom of Crotia was shared by eleven Zoupans, or feudatory lords;
and their united forces were numbered at sixty thousand horse and
one hundred thousand foot. A long sea-coast, indented with capacious
harbors, covered with a string of islands, and almost in sight of the
Italian shores, disposed both the natives and strangers to the practice
of navigation. The boats or brigantines of the Croats were constructed
after the fashion of the old Liburnians: one hundred and eighty vessels
may excite the idea of a respectable navy; but our seamen will smile at
the allowance of ten, or twenty, or forty, men for each of these ships
of war. They were gradually converted to the more honorable service of
commerce; yet the Sclavonian pirates were still frequent and dangerous;
and it was not before the close of the tenth century that the freedom
and sovereignty of the Gulf were effectually vindicated by the Venetian
republic. [12] The ancestors of these Dalmatian kings were equally
removed from the use and abuse of navigation: they dwelt in the White
Croatia, in the inland regions of Silesia and Little Poland, thirty
days' journey, according to the Greek computation, from the sea of
darkness.

Atell or Volga; but he deprives himself of all geographical credit by
discharging that river into the Euxine Sea.]

[Footnote 4: Paul. Diacon. de Gestis Langobard. l. v. c. 29, p. 881,

above-mentioned Greeks, is easily reconciled by Camillo Pellegrino (de
Ducatu Beneventano, dissert. vii. in the Scriptores Rerum Ital. (tom. v.
p. 186, 187) and Beretti, (Chorograph. Italiae Medii Aevi, p. 273, &c.
This Bulgarian colony was planted in a vacant district of Samnium, and
learned the Latin, without forgetting their native language.]

[Footnote 5: These provinces of the Greek idiom and empire are assigned
to the Bulgarian kingdom in the dispute of ecclesiastical jurisdiction
between the patriarchs of Rome and Constantinople, (Baronius, Annal.
Eccles. A.D. 869, No. 75.)]

[Footnote 6: The situation and royalty of Lychnidus, or Achrida, are
clearly expressed in Cedrenus, (p. 713.) The removal of an archbishop or
patriarch from Justinianea prima to Lychnidus, and at length to Ternovo,
has produced some perplexity in the ideas or language of the Greeks,
(Nicephorus Gregoras, l. ii. c. 2, p. 14, 15. Thomassin, Discipline de
l'Eglise, tom. i. l. i. c. 19, 23;) and a Frenchman (D'Anville) is more
accurately skilled in the geography of their own country, (Hist. de
l'Academie des Inscriptions, tom. xxxi.)]

[Footnote 7: Chalcocondyles, a competent judge, affirms the identity of
the language of the Dalmatians, Bosnians, Servians, Bulgarians, Poles,
(de Rebus Turcicis, l. x. p. 283,) and elsewhere of the Bohemians,
(l. ii. p. 38.) The same author has marked the separate idiom of the
Hungarians. * Note: The Slavonian languages are no doubt Indo-European,
though an original branch of that great family, comprehending the
various dialects named by Gibbon and others. Shafarik, t. 33.--M. 1845.]

[Footnote 8: See the work of John Christopher de Jordan, de Originibus
Sclavicis, Vindobonae, 1745, in four parts, or two volumes in folio. His
collections and researches are useful to elucidate the antiquities of
Bohemia and the adjacent countries; but his plan is narrow, his style
barbarous, his criticism shallow, and the Aulic counsellor is not free
from the prejudices of a Bohemian. * Note: We have at length a profound
and satisfactory work on the Slavonian races. Shafarik, Slawische
Alterthumer. B. 2, Leipzig, 1843.--M. 1845.]

[Footnote 9: Jordan subscribes to the well-known and probable derivation
from Slava, laus, gloria, a word of familiar use in the different
dialects and parts of speech, and which forms the termination of the
most illustrious names, (de Originibus Sclavicis, pars. i. p. 40, pars.
iv. p. 101, 102)]

[Footnote 10: This conversion of a national into an appellative name
appears to have arisen in the viiith century, in the Oriental France,
where the princes and bishops were rich in Sclavonian captives, not of
the Bohemian, (exclaims Jordan,) but of Sorabian race. From thence the
word was extended to the general use, to the modern languages, and even
to the style of the last Byzantines, (see the Greek and Latin Glossaries
and Ducange.) The confusion of the Servians with the Latin Servi, was
still more fortunate and familiar, (Constant. Porphyr. de Administrando,
Imperio, c. 32, p. 99.)]

[Footnote 11: The emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus, most accurate
for his own times, most fabulous for preceding ages, describes the
Sclavonians of Dalmatia, (c. 29-36.)]

[Footnote 12: See the anonymous Chronicle of the xith century, ascribed
to John Sagorninus, (p. 94-102,) and that composed in the xivth by the
Doge Andrew Dandolo, (Script. Rerum. Ital. tom. xii. p. 227-230,) the
two oldest monuments of the history of Venice.]

The glory of the Bulgarians [13] was confined to a narrow scope both of
time and place. In the ninth and tenth centuries, they reigned to the
south of the Danube; but the more powerful nations that had followed
their emigration repelled all return to the north and all progress to
the west. Yet in the obscure catalogue of their exploits, they might
boast an honor which had hitherto been appropriated to the Goths: that
of slaying in battle one of the successors of Augustus and Constantine.
The emperor Nicephorus had lost his fame in the Arabian, he lost his
life in the Sclavonian, war. In his first operations he advanced with
boldness and success into the centre of Bulgaria, and burnt the royal
court, which was probably no more than an edifice and village of timber.
But while he searched the spoil and refused all offers of treaty, his
enemies collected their spirits and their forces: the passes of retreat
were insuperably barred; and the trembling Nicephorus was heard to
exclaim, "Alas, alas! unless we could assume the wings of birds, we
cannot hope to escape." Two days he waited his fate in the inactivity of
despair; but, on the morning of the third, the Bulgarians surprised the
camp, and the Roman prince, with the great officers of the empire,
were slaughtered in their tents. The body of Valens had been saved
from insult; but the head of Nicephorus was exposed on a spear, and
his skull, enchased with gold, was often replenished in the feasts
of victory. The Greeks bewailed the dishonor of the throne; but they
acknowledged the just punishment of avarice and cruelty. This savage cup
was deeply tinctured with the manners of the Scythian wilderness; but
they were softened before the end of the same century by a peaceful
intercourse with the Greeks, the possession of a cultivated region, and
the introduction of the Christian worship. The nobles of Bulgaria were
educated in the schools and palace of Constantinople; and Simeon, [14]
a youth of the royal line, was instructed in the rhetoric of Demosthenes
and the logic of Aristotle. He relinquished the profession of a monk for
that of a king and warrior; and in his reign of more than forty years,
Bulgaria assumed a rank among the civilized powers of the earth. The
Greeks, whom he repeatedly attacked, derived a faint consolation from
indulging themselves in the reproaches of perfidy and sacrilege. They
purchased the aid of the Pagan Turks; but Simeon, in a second battle,
redeemed the loss of the first, at a time when it was esteemed a
victory to elude the arms of that formidable nation. The Servians
were overthrown, made captive and dispersed; and those who visited
the country before their restoration could discover no more than
fifty vagrants, without women or children, who extorted a precarious
subsistence from the chase. On classic ground, on the banks of Achelous,
the greeks were defeated; their horn was broken by the strength of the
Barbaric Hercules. [15] He formed the siege of Constantinople; and, in
a personal conference with the emperor, Simeon imposed the conditions of
peace. They met with the most jealous precautions: the royal gallery
was drawn close to an artificial and well-fortified platform; and the
majesty of the purple was emulated by the pomp of the Bulgarian. "Are
you a Christian?" said the humble Romanus: "it is your duty to abstain
from the blood of your fellow-Christians. Has the thirst of riches
seduced you from the blessings of peace? Sheathe your sword, open
your hand, and I will satiate the utmost measure of your desires." The
reconciliation was sealed by a domestic alliance; the freedom of trade
was granted or restored; the first honors of the court were secured to
the friends of Bulgaria, above the ambassadors of enemies or strangers;
[16] and her princes were dignified with the high and invidious title of
Basileus, or emperor. But this friendship was soon disturbed: after the
death of Simeon, the nations were again in arms; his feeble successors
were divided and extinguished; and, in the beginning of the eleventh
century, the second Basil, who was born in the purple, deserved the
appellation of conqueror of the Bulgarians. His avarice was in some
measure gratified by a treasure of four hundred thousand pounds
sterling, (ten thousand pounds' weight of gold,) which he found in
the palace of Lychnidus. His cruelty inflicted a cool and exquisite
vengeance on fifteen thousand captives who had been guilty of the
defence of their country. They were deprived of sight; but to one of
each hundred a single eye was left, that he might conduct his blind
century to the presence of their king. Their king is said to have
expired of grief and horror; the nation was awed by this terrible
example; the Bulgarians were swept away from their settlements, and
circumscribed within a narrow province; the surviving chiefs bequeathed
to their children the advice of patience and the duty of revenge.

[Footnote 13: The first kingdom of the Bulgarians may be found, under
the proper dates, in the Annals of Cedrenus and Zonaras. The Byzantine
materials are collected by Stritter, (Memoriae Populorum, tom. ii. pars
ii. p. 441-647;) and the series of their kings is disposed and settled
by Ducange, (Fam. Byzant. p. 305-318.]

[Footnote 14: Simeonem semi-Graecum esse aiebant, eo quod a pueritia
Byzantii Demosthenis rhetoricam et Aristotelis syllogismos didicerat,
(Liutprand, l. iii. c. 8.) He says in another place, Simeon, fortis
bella tor, Bulgariae praeerat; Christianus, sed vicinis Graecis valde
inimicus, (l. i. c. 2.)]

combat of the river god and the hero; the native and the stranger.]

[Footnote 16: The ambassador of Otho was provoked by the Greek excuses,

Reiske.]

II. When the black swarm of Hungarians first hung over Europe, above
nine hundred years after the Christian aera, they were mistaken by fear
and superstition for the Gog and Magog of the Scriptures, the signs
and forerunners of the end of the world. [17] Since the introduction
of letters, they have explored their own antiquities with a strong and
laudable impulse of patriotic curiosity. [18] Their rational criticism
can no longer be amused with a vain pedigree of Attila and the Huns; but
they complain that their primitive records have perished in the Tartar
war; that the truth or fiction of their rustic songs is long since
forgotten; and that the fragments of a rude chronicle [19] must be
painfully reconciled with the contemporary though foreign intelligence
of the imperial geographer. [20] Magiar is the national and oriental
denomination of the Hungarians; but, among the tribes of Scythia, they
are distinguished by the Greeks under the proper and peculiar name of
Turks, as the descendants of that mighty people who had conquered
and reigned from China to the Volga. The Pannonian colony preserved a
correspondence of trade and amity with the eastern Turks on the confines
of Persia and after a separation of three hundred and fifty years, the
missionaries of the king of Hungary discovered and visited their ancient
country near the banks of the Volga. They were hospitably entertained
by a people of Pagans and Savages who still bore the name of Hungarians;
conversed in their native tongue, recollected a tradition of their
long-lost brethren, and listened with amazement to the marvellous tale
of their new kingdom and religion. The zeal of conversion was animated
by the interest of consanguinity; and one of the greatest of
their princes had formed the generous, though fruitless, design of
replenishing the solitude of Pannonia by this domestic colony from the
heart of Tartary. [21] From this primitive country they were driven to
the West by the tide of war and emigration, by the weight of the more
distant tribes, who at the same time were fugitives and conquerors.
[2111] Reason or fortune directed their course towards the frontiers of
the Roman empire: they halted in the usual stations along the banks of
the great rivers; and in the territories of Moscow, Kiow, and Moldavia,
some vestiges have been discovered of their temporary residence. In
this long and various peregrination, they could not always escape the
dominion of the stronger; and the purity of their blood was improved or
sullied by the mixture of a foreign race: from a motive of compulsion,
or choice, several tribes of the Chazars were associated to the standard
of their ancient vassals; introduced the use of a second language; and
obtained by their superior renown the most honorable place in the front
of battle. The military force of the Turks and their allies marched in
seven equal and artificial divisions; each division was formed of thirty
thousand eight hundred and fifty-seven warriors, and the proportion of
women, children, and servants, supposes and requires at least a million
of emigrants. Their public counsels were directed by seven vayvods,
or hereditary chiefs; but the experience of discord and weakness
recommended the more simple and vigorous administration of a single
person. The sceptre, which had been declined by the modest Lebedias,
was granted to the birth or merit of Almus and his son Arpad, and the
authority of the supreme khan of the Chazars confirmed the engagement of
the prince and people; of the people to obey his commands, of the prince
to consult their happiness and glory.

[Footnote 17: A bishop of Wurtzburgh submitted his opinion to a
reverend abbot; but he more gravely decided, that Gog and Magog were the
spiritual persecutors of the church; since Gog signifies the root,
the pride of the Heresiarchs, and Magog what comes from the root, the
propagation of their sects. Yet these men once commanded the respect of
mankind, (Fleury, Hist. Eccles. tom. xi. p. 594, &c.)]

[Footnote 18: The two national authors, from whom I have derived the
mos assistance, are George Pray (Dissertationes and Annales veterum Hun
garorum, &c., Vindobonae, 1775, in folio) and Stephen Katona, (Hist.
Critica Ducum et Regum Hungariae Stirpis Arpadianae, Paestini,
1778-1781, 5 vols. in octavo.) The first embraces a large and
often conjectural space; the latter, by his learning, judgment, and
perspicuity, deserves the name of a critical historian. * Note: Compare
Engel Geschichte des Ungrischen Reichs und seiner Neben lander, Halle,
1797, and Mailath, Geschichte der Magyaren, Wien, 1828. In an appendix
to the latter work will be found a brief abstract of the speculations
(for it is difficult to consider them more) which have been advanced by
the learned, on the origin of the Magyar and Hungarian names. Compare
vol. vi. p. 35, note.--M.]

[Footnote 19: The author of this Chronicle is styled the notary of King
Bela. Katona has assigned him to the xiith century, and defends his
character against the hypercriticism of Pray. This rude annalist must
have transcribed some historical records, since he could affirm
with dignity, rejectis falsis fabulis rusticorum, et garrulo cantu
joculatorum. In the xvth century, these fables were collected
by Thurotzius, and embellished by the Italian Bonfinius. See the
Preliminary Discourse in the Hist. Critica Ducum, p. 7-33.]

[Footnote 20: See Constantine de Administrando Imperio, c. 3, 4, 13,
38-42, Katona has nicely fixed the composition of this work to the
years 949, 950, 951, (p. 4-7.) The critical historian (p. 34-107)
endeavors to prove the existence, and to relate the actions, of a first
duke Almus the father of Arpad, who is tacitly rejected by Constantine.]

[Footnote 21: Pray (Dissert. p. 37-39, &c.) produces and illustrates
the original passages of the Hungarian missionaries, Bonfinius and
Aeneas Sylvius.]

[Footnote 2111: In the deserts to the south-east of Astrakhan have been
found the ruins of a city named Madchar, which proves the residence of
the Hungarians or Magiar in those regions. Precis de la Geog. Univ. par
Malte Brun, vol. i. p. 353.--G.----This is contested by Klaproth in
his Travels, c. xxi. Madschar, (he states) in old Tartar, means
"stone building." This was a Tartar city mentioned by the Mahometan
writers.--M.]

With this narrative we might be reasonably content, if the penetration
of modern learning had not opened a new and larger prospect of the
antiquities of nations. The Hungarian language stands alone, and as it
were insulated, among the Sclavonian dialects; but it bears a close and
clear affinity to the idioms of the Fennic race, [22] of an obsolete and
savage race, which formerly occupied the northern regions of Asia and
Europe. [2211] The genuine appellation of Ugri or Igours is found on
the western confines of China; [23] their migration to the banks of the
Irtish is attested by Tartar evidence; [24] a similar name and language
are detected in the southern parts of Siberia; [25] and the remains of
the Fennic tribes are widely, though thinly scattered from the sources
of the Oby to the shores of Lapland. [26] The consanguinity of the
Hungarians and Laplanders would display the powerful energy of climate
on the children of a common parent; the lively contrast between the bold
adventurers who are intoxicated with the wines of the Danube, and the
wretched fugitives who are immersed beneath the snows of the polar
circle.

Arms and freedom have ever been the ruling, though too often the
unsuccessful, passion of the Hungarians, who are endowed by nature
with a vigorous constitution of soul and body. [27] Extreme cold has
diminished the stature and congealed the faculties of the Laplanders;
and the arctic tribes, alone among the sons of men, are ignorant of war,
and unconscious of human blood; a happy ignorance, if reason and virtue
were the guardians of their peace! [28]

[Footnote 22: Fischer in the Quaestiones Petropolitanae, de Origine
Ungrorum, and Pray, Dissertat. i. ii. iii. &c., have drawn up several
comparative tables of the Hungarian with the Fennic dialects. The
affinity is indeed striking, but the lists are short; the words are
purposely chosen; and I read in the learned Bayer, (Comment. Academ.
Petropol. tom. x. p. 374,) that although the Hungarian has adopted many
Fennic words, (innumeras voces,) it essentially differs toto genio et
natura.]

[Footnote 2211: The connection between the Magyar language and that of
the Finns is now almost generally admitted. Klaproth, Asia Polyglotta,
p. 188, &c. Malte Bran, tom. vi. p. 723, &c.--M.]

described by the Chinese Geographers, (Gaubil, Hist. du Grand Gengiscan,

Collection of Voyages and Travels, vol. ii. p. 920, 921) and Bell
(Travels, vol. i p. 174) found the Vogulitz in the neighborhood of
Tobolsky. By the tortures of the etymological art, Ugur and Vogul are
reduced to the same name; the circumjacent mountains really bear the
appellation of Ugrian; and of all the Fennic dialects, the Vogulian is
the nearest to the Hungarian, (Fischer, Dissert. i. p. 20-30. Pray.
Dissert. ii. p. 31-34.)]

curious work of M. Leveque, (Hist. des Peuples soumis a la Domination de

drawn from the Tactics of Leo, p. 796-801, and the Latin Annals, which
are alleged by Baronius, Pagi, and Muratori, A.D. 889, &c.]

[Footnote 28: Buffon, Hist. Naturelle, tom. v. p. 6, in 12mo. Gustavus
Adolphus attempted, without success, to form a regiment of Laplanders.
Grotius says of these arctic tribes, arma arcus et pharetra, sed
adversus feras, (Annal. l. iv. p. 236;) and attempts, after the manner
of Tacitus, to varnish with philosophy their brutal ignorance.]
