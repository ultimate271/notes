## Chapter XLIII: Last Victory And Death Of Belisarius, Death Of Justinian.--Part IV.

About two years after the last victory of Belisarius, the emperor
returned from a Thracian journey of health, or business, or devotion.
Justinian was afflicted by a pain in his head; and his private entry
countenanced the rumor of his death. Before the third hour of the day,
the bakers' shops were plundered of their bread, the houses were shut,
and every citizen, with hope or terror, prepared for the impending
tumult. The senators themselves, fearful and suspicious, were convened
at the ninth hour; and the praefect received their commands to visit
every quarter of the city, and proclaim a general illumination for
the recovery of the emperor's health. The ferment subsided; but every
accident betrayed the impotence of the government, and the factious
temper of the people: the guards were disposed to mutiny as often as
their quarters were changed, or their pay was withheld: the frequent
calamities of fires and earthquakes afforded the opportunities of
disorder; the disputes of the blues and greens, of the orthodox and
heretics, degenerated into bloody battles; and, in the presence of the
Persian ambassador, Justinian blushed for himself and for his subjects.
Capricious pardon and arbitrary punishment imbittered the irksomeness
and discontent of a long reign: a conspiracy was formed in the palace;
and, unless we are deceived by the names of Marcellus and Sergius, the
most virtuous and the most profligate of the courtiers were associated
in the same designs. They had fixed the time of the execution; their
rank gave them access to the royal banquet; and their black slaves [65]
were stationed in the vestibule and porticos, to announce the death
of the tyrant, and to excite a sedition in the capital. But the
indiscretion of an accomplice saved the poor remnant of the days of
Justinian. The conspirators were detected and seized, with daggers
hidden under their garments: Marcellus died by his own hand, and Sergius
was dragged from the sanctuary. [66] Pressed by remorse, or tempted
by the hopes of safety, he accused two officers of the household of
Belisarius; and torture forced them to declare that they had acted
according to the secret instructions of their patron. [67] Posterity
will not hastily believe that a hero who, in the vigor of life, had
disdained the fairest offers of ambition and revenge, should stoop to
the murder of his prince, whom he could not long expect to survive. His
followers were impatient to fly; but flight must have been supported by
rebellion, and he had lived enough for nature and for glory. Belisarius
appeared before the council with less fear than indignation: after forty
years' service, the emperor had prejudged his guilt; and injustice was
sanctified by the presence and authority of the patriarch. The life of
Belisarius was graciously spared; but his fortunes were sequestered,
and, from December to July, he was guarded as a prisoner in his own
palace. At length his innocence was acknowledged; his freedom and honor
were restored; and death, which might be hastened by resentment and
grief, removed him from the world in about eight months after his
deliverance. The name of Belisarius can never die but instead of the
funeral, the monuments, the statues, so justly due to his memory, I
only read, that his treasures, the spoil of the Goths and Vandals,
were immediately confiscated by the emperor. Some decent portion was
reserved, however for the use of his widow: and as Antonina had much
to repent, she devoted the last remains of her life and fortune to the
foundation of a convent. Such is the simple and genuine narrative of the
fall of Belisarius and the ingratitude of Justinian. [68] That he was
deprived of his eyes, and reduced by envy to beg his bread, [6811] "Give
a penny to Belisarius the general!" is a fiction of later times, [69]
which has obtained credit, or rather favor, as a strange example of the
vicissitudes of fortune. [70]

[Footnote 65: They could scarcely be real Indians; and the Aethiopians,
sometimes known by that name, were never used by the ancients as guards
or followers: they were the trifling, though costly objects of female
and royal luxury, (Terent. Eunuch. act. i. scene ii Sueton. in August.
c. 83, with a good note of Casaubon, in Caligula, c. 57.)]

[Footnote 66: The Sergius (Vandal. l. ii. c. 21, 22, Anecdot. c. 5)
and Marcellus (Goth. l. iii. c. 32) are mentioned by Procopius. See
Theophanes, p. 197, 201. * Note: Some words, "the acts of," or "the
crimes cf," appear to have false from the text. The omission is in all
the editions I have consulted.--M.]

[Footnote 67: Alemannus, (p. quotes an old Byzantian Ms., which has been
printed in the Imperium Orientale of Banduri.)]

[Footnote 68: Of the disgrace and restoration of Belisarius, the genuine
original record is preserved in the Fragment of John Malala (tom. ii. p.
234--243) and the exact Chronicle of Theophanes, (p. 194--204.) Cedrenus
(Compend. p. 387, 388) and Zonaras (tom. ii. l. xiv. p. 69) seem to
hesitate between the obsolete truth and the growing falsehood.]

[Footnote 6811: Le Beau, following Allemannus, conceives that Belisarius
was confounded with John of Cappadocia, who was thus reduced to beggary,
(vol. ix. p. 58, 449.) Lord Mahon has, with considerable learning,
and on the authority of a yet unquoted writer of the eleventh century,
endeavored to reestablish the old tradition. I cannot acknowledge that
I have been convinced, and am inclined to subscribe to the theory of Le
Beau.--M.]

[Footnote 69: The source of this idle fable may be derived from a
miscellaneous work of the xiith century, the Chiliads of John Tzetzes,
a monk, (Basil. 1546, ad calcem Lycophront. Colon. Allobrog. 1614, in
Corp. Poet. Graec.) He relates the blindness and beggary of Belisarius
in ten vulgar or political verses, (Chiliad iii. No. 88, 339--348, in
Corp. Poet. Graec. tom. ii. p. 311.) This moral or romantic tale
was imported into Italy with the language and manuscripts of Greece;
repeated before the end of the xvth century by Crinitus, Pontanus, and
Volaterranus, attacked by Alciat, for the honor of the law; and defended
by Baronius, (A.D. 561, No. 2, &c.,) for the honor of the church. Yet
Tzetzes himself had read in other chronicles, that Belisarius did not
lose his sight, and that he recovered his fame and fortunes. * Note:
I know not where Gibbon found Tzetzes to be a monk; I suppose he
considered his bad verses a proof of his monachism. Compare to Gerbelius
in Kiesling's edition of Tzetzes.--M.]

[Footnote 70: The statue in the villa Borghese at Rome, in a sitting
posture, with an open hand, which is vulgarly given to Belisarius, may
be ascribed with more dignity to Augustus in the act of propitiating
Nemesis, (Winckelman, Hist. de l'Art, tom. iii. p. 266.) Ex nocturno
visu etiam stipem, quotannis, die certo, emendicabat a populo, cavana
manum asses porrigentibus praebens, (Sueton. in August. c. 91, with an
excellent note of Casaubon.) * Note: Lord Mahon abandons the statue, as
altogether irreconcilable with the state of the arts at this period, (p.
472.)--M.]

If the emperor could rejoice in the death of Belisarius, he enjoyed
the base satisfaction only eight months, the last period of a reign
of thirty-eight years, and a life of eighty-three years. It would
be difficult to trace the character of a prince who is not the most
conspicuous object of his own times: but the confessions of an enemy may
be received as the safest evidence of his virtues. The resemblance of
Justinian to the bust of Domitian, is maliciously urged; [71] with
the acknowledgment, however, of a well-proportioned figure, a ruddy
complexion, and a pleasing countenance. The emperor was easy of access,
patient of hearing, courteous and affable in discourse, and a master
of the angry passions which rage with such destructive violence in the
breast of a despot. Procopius praises his temper, to reproach him with
calm and deliberate cruelty: but in the conspiracies which attacked his
authority and person, a more candid judge will approve the justice, or
admire the clemency, of Justinian. He excelled in the private virtues
of chastity and temperance: but the impartial love of beauty would have
been less mischievous than his conjugal tenderness for Theodora; and his
abstemious diet was regulated, not by the prudence of a philosopher, but
the superstition of a monk. His repasts were short and frugal: on solemn
fasts, he contented himself with water and vegetables; and such was his
strength, as well as fervor, that he frequently passed two days, and as
many nights, without tasting any food. The measure of his sleep was not
less rigorous: after the repose of a single hour, the body was awakened
by the soul, and, to the astonishment of his chamberlain, Justinian
walked or studied till the morning light. Such restless application
prolonged his time for the acquisition of knowledge [72] and the
despatch of business; and he might seriously deserve the reproach of
confounding, by minute and preposterous diligence, the general order
of his administration. The emperor professed himself a musician and
architect, a poet and philosopher, a lawyer and theologian; and if he
failed in the enterprise of reconciling the Christian sects, the
review of the Roman jurisprudence is a noble monument of his spirit and
industry. In the government of the empire, he was less wise, or less
successful: the age was unfortunate; the people was oppressed and
discontented; Theodora abused her power; a succession of bad ministers
disgraced his judgment; and Justinian was neither beloved in his life,
nor regretted at his death. The love of fame was deeply implanted in his
breast, but he condescended to the poor ambition of titles, honors,
and contemporary praise; and while he labored to fix the admiration, he
forfeited the esteem and affection, of the Romans.

The design of the African and Italian wars was boldly conceived and
executed; and his penetration discovered the talents of Belisarius
in the camp, of Narses in the palace. But the name of the emperor is
eclipsed by the names of his victorious generals; and Belisarius still
lives, to upbraid the envy and ingratitude of his sovereign. The partial
favor of mankind applauds the genius of a conqueror, who leads and
directs his subjects in the exercise of arms. The characters of Philip
the Second and of Justinian are distinguished by the cold ambition which
delights in war, and declines the dangers of the field. Yet a colossal
statue of bronze represented the emperor on horseback, preparing to
march against the Persians in the habit and armor of Achilles. In the
great square before the church of St. Sophia, this monument was raised
on a brass column and a stone pedestal of seven steps; and the pillar of
Theodosius, which weighed seven thousand four hundred pounds of silver,
was removed from the same place by the avarice and vanity of Justinian.
Future princes were more just or indulgent to his memory; the elder
Andronicus, in the beginning of the fourteenth century, repaired and
beautified his equestrian statue: since the fall of the empire it has
been melted into cannon by the victorious Turks. [73]

[Footnote 71: The rubor of Domitian is stigmatized, quaintly enough,
by the pen of Tacitus, (in Vit. Agricol. c. 45;) and has been likewise
noticed by the younger Pliny, (Panegyr. c. 48,) and Suetonius, (in
Domitian, c. 18, and Casaubon ad locum.) Procopius (Anecdot. c. 8)
foolishly believes that only one bust of Domitian had reached the vith
century.]

[Footnote 72: The studies and science of Justinian are attested by the
confession (Anecdot. c. 8, 13) still more than by the praises (Gothic.
l. iii. c. 31, de Edific. l. i. Proem. c. 7) of Procopius. Consult the
copious index of Alemannus, and read the life of Justinian by Ludewig,
(p. 135--142.)]

[Footnote 73: See in the C. P. Christiana of Ducange (l. i. c. 24,
No. 1) a chain of original testimonies, from Procopius in the vith, to
Gyllius in the xvith century.]

I shall conclude this chapter with the comets, the earthquakes, and the
plague, which astonished or afflicted the age of Justinian. I. In the
fifth year of his reign, and in the month of September, a comet [74] was
seen during twenty days in the western quarter of the heavens, and which
shot its rays into the north. Eight years afterwards, while the sun was
in Capricorn, another comet appeared to follow in the Sagittary; the
size was gradually increasing; the head was in the east, the tail in the
west, and it remained visible above forty days. The nations, who gazed
with astonishment, expected wars and calamities from their baleful
influence; and these expectations were abundantly fulfilled. The
astronomers dissembled their ignorance of the nature of these blazing
stars, which they affected to represent as the floating meteors of the
air; and few among them embraced the simple notion of Seneca and the
Chaldeans, that they are only planets of a longer period and more
eccentric motion. [75] Time and science have justified the conjectures
and predictions of the Roman sage: the telescope has opened new worlds
to the eyes of astronomers; [76] and, in the narrow space of history
and fable, one and the same comet is already found to have revisited the
earth in seven equal revolutions of five hundred and seventy-five years.
The first, [77] which ascends beyond the Christian aera one thousand
seven hundred and sixty-seven years, is coeval with Ogyges, the father
of Grecian antiquity. And this appearance explains the tradition which
Varro has preserved, that under his reign the planet Venus changed her
color, size, figure, and course; a prodigy without example either in
past or succeeding ages. [78] The second visit, in the year eleven
hundred and ninety-three, is darkly implied in the fable of Electra, the
seventh of the Pleiads, who have been reduced to six since the time of
the Trojan war. That nymph, the wife of Dardanus, was unable to support
the ruin of her country: she abandoned the dances of her sister
orbs, fled from the zodiac to the north pole, and obtained, from her
dishevelled locks, the name of the comet. The third period expires in
the year six hundred and eighteen, a date that exactly agrees with the
tremendous comet of the Sibyl, and perhaps of Pliny, which arose in the
West two generations before the reign of Cyrus. The fourth apparition,
forty-four years before the birth of Christ, is of all others the most
splendid and important. After the death of Caesar, a long-haired star
was conspicuous to Rome and to the nations, during the games which were
exhibited by young Octavian in honor of Venus and his uncle. The vulgar
opinion, that it conveyed to heaven the divine soul of the dictator, was
cherished and consecrated by the piety of a statesman; while his secret
superstition referred the comet to the glory of his own times. [79] The
fifth visit has been already ascribed to the fifth year of Justinian,
which coincides with the five hundred and thirty-first of the Christian
aera. And it may deserve notice, that in this, as in the preceding
instance, the comet was followed, though at a longer interval, by a
remarkable paleness of the sun. The sixth return, in the year eleven
hundred and six, is recorded by the chronicles of Europe and China: and
in the first fervor of the crusades, the Christians and the Mahometans
might surmise, with equal reason, that it portended the destruction of
the Infidels. The seventh phenomenon, of one thousand six hundred
and eighty, was presented to the eyes of an enlightened age. [80] The
philosophy of Bayle dispelled a prejudice which Milton's muse had
so recently adorned, that the comet, "from its horrid hair shakes
pestilence and war." [81] Its road in the heavens was observed with
exquisite skill by Flamstead and Cassini: and the mathematical science
of Bernoulli, Newton [8111], and Halley, investigated the laws of
its revolutions. At the eighth period, in the year two thousand three
hundred and fifty-five, their calculations may perhaps be verified
by the astronomers of some future capital in the Siberian or American
wilderness.

[Footnote 74: The first comet is mentioned by John Malala (tom. ii. p.
190, 219) and Theophanes, (p. 154;) the second by Procopius, (Persic. l.
ii. 4.) Yet I strongly suspect their identity. The paleness of the
sun sum Vandal. (l. ii. c. 14) is applied by Theophanes (p. 158) to a
different year. Note: See Lydus de Ostentis, particularly c 15, in which
the author begins to show the signification of comets according to
the part of the heavens in which they appear, and what fortunes they
prognosticate to the Roman empire and their Persian enemies. The
chapter, however, is imperfect. (Edit. Neibuhr, p. 290.)--M.]

[Footnote 75: Seneca's viith book of Natural Questions displays, in the
theory of comets, a philosophic mind. Yet should we not too candidly
confound a vague prediction, a venient tempus, &c., with the merit of
real discoveries.]

[Footnote 76: Astronomers may study Newton and Halley. I draw my humble
science from the article Comete, in the French Encyclopedie, by M.
d'Alembert.]

[Footnote 77: Whiston, the honest, pious, visionary Whiston, had
fancied for the aera of Noah's flood (2242 years before Christ) a prior
apparition of the same comet which drowned the earth with its tail.]

[Footnote 78: A Dissertation of Freret (Memoires de l'Academie des
Inscriptions, tom. x. p. 357-377) affords a happy union of philosophy
and erudition. The phenomenon in the time of Ogyges was preserved by
Varro, (Apud Augustin. de Civitate Dei, xxi. 8,) who quotes Castor,
Dion of Naples, and Adastrus of Cyzicus--nobiles mathematici. The two
subsequent periods are preserved by the Greek mythologists and the
spurious books of Sibylline verses.]

[Footnote 79: Pliny (Hist. Nat. ii. 23) has transcribed the original
memorial of Augustus. Mairan, in his most ingenious letters to the
P. Parennin, missionary in China, removes the games and the comet of
September, from the year 44 to the year 43, before the Christian
aera; but I am not totally subdued by the criticism of the astronomer,
(Opuscules, p. 275 )]

[Footnote 80: This last comet was visible in the month of December,
1680. Bayle, who began his Pensees sur la Comete in January, 1681,
(Oeuvres, tom. iii.,) was forced to argue that a supernatural comet
would have confirmed the ancients in their idolatry. Bernoulli (see his
Eloge, in Fontenelle, tom. v. p. 99) was forced to allow that the tail
though not the head, was a sign of the wrath of God.]

[Footnote 81: Paradise Lost was published in the year 1667; and the
famous lines (l. ii. 708, &c.) which startled the licenser, may allude
to the recent comet of 1664, observed by Cassini at Rome in the presence
of Queen Christina, (Fontenelle, in his Eloge, tom. v. p. 338.) Had
Charles II. betrayed any symptoms of curiosity or fear?]

[Footnote 8111: Compare Pingre, Histoire des Cometes.--M.]

II. The near approach of a comet may injure or destroy the globe which
we inhabit; but the changes on its surface have been hitherto produced
by the action of volcanoes and earthquakes. [82] The nature of the soil
may indicate the countries most exposed to these formidable concussions,
since they are caused by subterraneous fires, and such fires are kindled
by the union and fermentation of iron and sulphur. But their times
and effects appear to lie beyond the reach of human curiosity; and the
philosopher will discreetly abstain from the prediction of earthquakes,
till he has counted the drops of water that silently filtrate on
the inflammable mineral, and measured the caverns which increase by
resistance the explosion of the imprisoned air. Without assigning the
cause, history will distinguish the periods in which these calamitous
events have been rare or frequent, and will observe, that this fever of
the earth raged with uncommon violence during the reign of Justinian.
[83] Each year is marked by the repetition of earthquakes, of such
duration, that Constantinople has been shaken above forty days; of such
extent, that the shock has been communicated to the whole surface of the
globe, or at least of the Roman empire. An impulsive or vibratory
motion was felt: enormous chasms were opened, huge and heavy bodies
were discharged into the air, the sea alternately advanced and retreated
beyond its ordinary bounds, and a mountain was torn from Libanus, [84]
and cast into the waves, where it protected, as a mole, the new harbor
of Botrys [85] in Phoenicia. The stroke that agitates an ant-hill may
crush the insect-myriads in the dust; yet truth must extort confession
that man has industriously labored for his own destruction. The
institution of great cities, which include a nation within the limits of
a wall, almost realizes the wish of Caligula, that the Roman people had
but one neck. Two hundred and fifty thousand persons are said to have
perished in the earthquake of Antioch, whose domestic multitudes were
swelled by the conflux of strangers to the festival of the Ascension.
The loss of Berytus [86] was of smaller account, but of much greater
value. That city, on the coast of Phoenicia, was illustrated by the
study of the civil law, which opened the surest road to wealth and
dignity: the schools of Berytus were filled with the rising spirits of
the age, and many a youth was lost in the earthquake, who might have
lived to be the scourge or the guardian of his country. In these
disasters, the architect becomes the enemy of mankind. The hut of a
savage, or the tent of an Arab, may be thrown down without injury to the
inhabitant; and the Peruvians had reason to deride the folly of their
Spanish conquerors, who with so much cost and labor erected their own
sepulchres. The rich marbles of a patrician are dashed on his own head:
a whole people is buried under the ruins of public and private edifices,
and the conflagration is kindled and propagated by the innumerable fires
which are necessary for the subsistence and manufactures of a great
city. Instead of the mutual sympathy which might comfort and assist the
distressed, they dreadfully experience the vices and passions which are
released from the fear of punishment: the tottering houses are pillaged
by intrepid avarice; revenge embraces the moment, and selects the
victim; and the earth often swallows the assassin, or the ravisher,
in the consummation of their crimes. Superstition involves the present
danger with invisible terrors; and if the image of death may sometimes
be subservient to the virtue or repentance of individuals, an affrighted
people is more forcibly moved to expect the end of the world, or to
deprecate with servile homage the wrath of an avenging Deity.

ii. p. 51, 52) suspends the earthquake till he has achieved the Italian
war.]

III. Aethiopia and Egypt have been stigmatized, in every age, as
the original source and seminary of the plague. [87] In a damp, hot,
stagnating air, this African fever is generated from the putrefaction of
animal substances, and especially from the swarms of locusts, not less
destructive to mankind in their death than in their lives. The fatal
disease which depopulated the earth in the time of Justinian and his
successors, [88] first appeared in the neighborhood of Pelusium, between
the Serbonian bog and the eastern channel of the Nile. From thence,
tracing as it were a double path, it spread to the East, over Syria,
Persia, and the Indies, and penetrated to the West, along the coast of
Africa, and over the continent of Europe. In the spring of the second
year, Constantinople, during three or four months, was visited by the
pestilence; and Procopius, who observed its progress and symptoms with
the eyes of a physician, [89] has emulated the skill and diligence
of Thucydides in the description of the plague of Athens. [90] The
infection was sometimes announced by the visions of a distempered fancy,
and the victim despaired as soon as he had heard the menace and felt the
stroke of an invisible spectre. But the greater number, in their beds,
in the streets, in their usual occupation, were surprised by a slight
fever; so slight, indeed, that neither the pulse nor the color of the
patient gave any signs of the approaching danger. The same, the next,
or the succeeding day, it was declared by the swelling of the glands,
particularly those of the groin, of the armpits, and under the ear; and
when these buboes or tumors were opened, they were found to contain a
coal, or black substance, of the size of a lentil. If they came to a
just swelling and suppuration, the patient was saved by this kind and
natural discharge of the morbid humor. But if they continued hard and
dry, a mortification quickly ensued, and the fifth day was commonly
the term of his life. The fever was often accompanied with lethargy or
delirium; the bodies of the sick were covered with black pustules or
carbuncles, the symptoms of immediate death; and in the constitutions
too feeble to produce an irruption, the vomiting of blood was followed
by a mortification of the bowels. To pregnant women the plague was
generally mortal: yet one infant was drawn alive from his dead mother,
and three mothers survived the loss of their infected foetus. Youth was
the most perilous season; and the female sex was less susceptible than
the male: but every rank and profession was attacked with indiscriminate
rage, and many of those who escaped were deprived of the use of their
speech, without being secure from a return of the disorder. [91] The
physicians of Constantinople were zealous and skilful; but their art
was baffled by the various symptoms and pertinacious vehemence of the
disease: the same remedies were productive of contrary effects, and the
event capriciously disappointed their prognostics of death or recovery.
The order of funerals, and the right of sepulchres, were confounded:
those who were left without friends or servants, lay unburied in the
streets, or in their desolate houses; and a magistrate was authorized to
collect the promiscuous heaps of dead bodies, to transport them by land
or water, and to inter them in deep pits beyond the precincts of the
city. Their own danger, and the prospect of public distress, awakened
some remorse in the minds of the most vicious of mankind: the confidence
of health again revived their passions and habits; but philosophy must
disdain the observation of Procopius, that the lives of such men were
guarded by the peculiar favor of fortune or Providence. He forgot, or
perhaps he secretly recollected, that the plague had touched the
person of Justinian himself; but the abstemious diet of the emperor may
suggest, as in the case of Socrates, a more rational and honorable cause
for his recovery. [92] During his sickness, the public consternation
was expressed in the habits of the citizens; and their idleness and
despondence occasioned a general scarcity in the capital of the East.
[Footnote 87: I have read with pleasure Mead's short, but elegant,
treatise concerning Pestilential Disorders, the viiith edition, London,
1722.]

[Footnote 88: The great plague which raged in 542 and the following
years (Pagi, Critica, tom. ii. p. 518) must be traced in Procopius,
(Persic. l. ii. c. 22, 23,) Agathias, (l. v. p. 153, 154,) Evagrius,
(l. iv. c. 29,) Paul Diaconus, (l. ii. c. iv. p. 776, 777,) Gregory of
Tours, (tom. ii. l. iv. c. 5, p 205,) who styles it Lues Inguinaria, and
the Chronicles of Victor Tunnunensis, (p. 9, in Thesaur. Temporum,) of
Marcellinus, (p. 54,) and of Theophanes, (p. 153.)]

[Footnote 89: Dr. Friend (Hist. Medicin. in Opp. p. 416--420, Lond.
1733) is satisfied that Procopius must have studied physic, from his
knowledge and use of the technical words. Yet many words that are now
scientific were common and popular in the Greek idiom.]

[Footnote 90: See Thucydides, l. ii. c. 47--54, p. 127--133, edit.
Duker, and the poetical description of the same plague by Lucretius.
(l. vi. 1136--1284.) I was indebted to Dr. Hunter for an elaborate
commentary on this part of Thucydides, a quarto of 600 pages, (Venet.
1603, apud Juntas,) which was pronounced in St. Mark's Library by Fabius
Paullinus Utinensis, a physician and philosopher.]

[Footnote 91: Thucydides (c. 51) affirms, that the infection could only
be once taken; but Evagrius, who had family experience of the plague,
observes, that some persons, who had escaped the first, sunk under the
second attack; and this repetition is confirmed by Fabius Paullinus,
(p. 588.) I observe, that on this head physicians are divided; and the
nature and operation of the disease may not always be similar.]

[Footnote 92: It was thus that Socrates had been saved by his
temperance, in the plague of Athens, (Aul. Gellius, Noct. Attic. ii. l.)
Dr. Mead accounts for the peculiar salubrity of religious houses, by the
two advantages of seclusion and abstinence, (p. 18, 19.)]

Contagion is the inseparable symptom of the plague; which, by mutual
respiration, is transfused from the infected persons to the lungs and
stomach of those who approach them. While philosophers believe and
tremble, it is singular, that the existence of a real danger should have
been denied by a people most prone to vain and imaginary terrors. [93]
Yet the fellow-citizens of Procopius were satisfied, by some short
and partial experience, that the infection could not be gained by
the closest conversation: [94] and this persuasion might support the
assiduity of friends or physicians in the care of the sick, whom inhuman
prudence would have condemned to solitude and despair. But the fatal
security, like the predestination of the Turks, must have aided the
progress of the contagion; and those salutary precautions to which
Europe is indebted for her safety, were unknown to the government
of Justinian. No restraints were imposed on the free and frequent
intercourse of the Roman provinces: from Persia to France, the nations
were mingled and infected by wars and emigrations; and the pestilential
odor which lurks for years in a bale of cotton was imported, by
the abuse of trade, into the most distant regions. The mode of its
propagation is explained by the remark of Procopius himself, that
it always spread from the sea-coast to the inland country: the most
sequestered islands and mountains were successively visited; the places
which had escaped the fury of its first passage were alone exposed to
the contagion of the ensuing year. The winds might diffuse that
subtile venom; but unless the atmosphere be previously disposed for
its reception, the plague would soon expire in the cold or temperate
climates of the earth. Such was the universal corruption of the air,
that the pestilence which burst forth in the fifteenth year of Justinian
was not checked or alleviated by any difference of the seasons. In time,
its first malignity was abated and dispersed; the disease alternately
languished and revived; but it was not till the end of a calamitous
period of fifty-two years, that mankind recovered their health, or the
air resumed its pure and salubrious quality.

No facts have been preserved to sustain an account, or even a
conjecture, of the numbers that perished in this extraordinary
mortality. I only find, that during three months, five, and at length
ten, thousand persons died each day at Constantinople; that many cities
of the East were left vacant, and that in several districts of Italy the
harvest and the vintage withered on the ground. The triple scourge of
war, pestilence, and famine, afflicted the subjects of Justinian; and
his reign is disgraced by the visible decrease of the human species,
which has never been repaired in some of the fairest countries of the
globe. [95]

[Footnote 93: Mead proves that the plague is contagious from Thucydides,
Lacretius, Aristotle, Galen, and common experience, (p. 10--20;) and
he refutes (Preface, p. 2--13) the contrary opinion of the French
physicians who visited Marseilles in the year 1720. Yet these were the
recent and enlightened spectators of a plague which, in a few months,
swept away 50,000 inhabitants (sur le Peste de Marseille, Paris, 1786)
of a city that, in the present hour of prosperity and trade contains no
more then 90,000 souls, (Necker, sur les Finances, tom. i. p. 231.)]

[Footnote 94: The strong assertions of Procopius are overthrown by the
subsequent experience of Evagrius.]

[Footnote 95: After some figures of rhetoric, the sands of the sea, &c.,
Procopius (Anecdot. c. 18) attempts a more definite account; that it had
been exterminated under the reign of the Imperial demon. The expression
is obscure in grammar and arithmetic and a literal interpretation would
produce several millions of millions Alemannus (p. 80) and Cousin (tom.
iii. p. 178) translate this passage, "two hundred millions:" but I
am ignorant of their motives. The remaining myriad of myriads, would
furnish one hundred millions, a number not wholly inadmissible.]
