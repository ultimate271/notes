## Chapter LXIX: State Of Rome From The Twelfth Century.--Part II.

Yet the courage of Arnold was not devoid of discretion: he was
protected, and had perhaps been invited, by the nobles and people; and
in the service of freedom, his eloquence thundered over the seven hills.
Blending in the same discourse the texts of Livy and St. Paul, uniting
the motives of gospel, and of classic, enthusiasm, he admonished the
Romans, how strangely their patience and the vices of the clergy had
degenerated from the primitive times of the church and the city. He
exhorted them to assert the inalienable rights of men and Christians; to
restore the laws and magistrates of the republic; to respect the
_name_ of the emperor; but to confine their shepherd to the spiritual
government of his flock. [26] Nor could his spiritual government escape
the censure and control of the reformer; and the inferior clergy
were taught by his lessons to resist the cardinals, who had usurped a
despotic command over the twenty-eight regions or parishes of Rome. [27]
The revolution was not accomplished without rapine and violence, the
diffusion of blood and the demolition of houses: the victorious faction
was enriched with the spoils of the clergy and the adverse nobles.
Arnold of Brescia enjoyed, or deplored, the effects of his mission: his
reign continued above ten years, while two popes, Innocent the Second
and Anastasius the Fourth, either trembled in the Vatican, or wandered
as exiles in the adjacent cities. They were succeeded by a more vigorous
and fortunate pontiff. Adrian the Fourth, [28] the only Englishman who
has ascended the throne of St. Peter; and whose merit emerged from the
mean condition of a monk, and almost a beggar, in the monastery of St.
Albans. On the first provocation, of a cardinal killed or wounded in the
streets, he cast an interdict on the guilty people; and from Christmas
to Easter, Rome was deprived of the real or imaginary comforts of
religious worship. The Romans had despised their temporal prince: they
submitted with grief and terror to the censures of their spiritual
father: their guilt was expiated by penance, and the banishment of the
seditious preacher was the price of their absolution. But the revenge of
Adrian was yet unsatisfied, and the approaching coronation of Frederic
Barbarossa was fatal to the bold reformer, who had offended, though
not in an equal degree, the heads of the church and state. In their
interview at Viterbo, the pope represented to the emperor the furious,
ungovernable spirit of the Romans; the insults, the injuries, the fears,
to which his person and his clergy were continually exposed; and the
pernicious tendency of the heresy of Arnold, which must subvert the
principles of civil, as well as ecclesiastical, subordination. Frederic
was convinced by these arguments, or tempted by the desire of the
Imperial crown: in the balance of ambition, the innocence or life of an
individual is of small account; and their common enemy was sacrificed to
a moment of political concord. After his retreat from Rome, Arnold had
been protected by the viscounts of Campania, from whom he was extorted
by the power of Cæsar: the præfect of the city pronounced his sentence:
the martyr of freedom was burned alive in the presence of a careless
and ungrateful people; and his ashes were cast into the Tyber, lest the
heretics should collect and worship the relics of their master. [29] The
clergy triumphed in his death: with his ashes, his sect was dispersed;
his memory still lived in the minds of the Romans. From his school they
had probably derived a new article of faith, that the metropolis of
the Catholic church is exempt from the penalties of excommunication and
interdict. Their bishops might argue, that the supreme jurisdiction,
which they exercised over kings and nations, more especially embraced
the city and diocese of the prince of the apostles. But they preached to
the winds, and the same principle that weakened the effect, must temper
the abuse, of the thunders of the Vatican.

[Footnote 26: He advised the Romans,
     Consiliis armisque sua moderamina summa
     Arbitrio tractare suo: nil juris in hâc re
     Pontifici summo, modicum concedere regi
     Suadebat populo. Sic læsâ stultus utrâque
     Majestate, reum geminæ se fecerat aulæ.
Nor is the poetry of Gunther different from the prose of Otho.]

[Footnote 27: See Baronius (A.D. 1148, No. 38, 39) from the Vatican
MSS. He loudly condemns Arnold (A.D. 1141, No. 3) as the father of the
political heretics, whose influence then hurt him in France.]

[Footnote 28: The English reader may consult the Biographia Britannica,
Adrian IV.; but our own writers have added nothing to the fame or merits
of their countrymen.]

[Footnote 29: Besides the historian and poet already quoted, the
last adventures of Arnold are related by the biographer of Adrian IV.
(Muratori. Script. Rerum Ital. tom. iii. P. i. p. 441, 442.)]

The love of ancient freedom has encouraged a belief that as early as
the tenth century, in their first struggles against the Saxon Othos,
the commonwealth was vindicated and restored by the senate and people of
Rome; that two consuls were annually elected among the nobles, and that
ten or twelve plebeian magistrates revived the name and office of the
tribunes of the commons. [30] But this venerable structure disappears
before the light of criticism. In the darkness of the middle ages,
the appellations of senators, of consuls, of the sons of consuls, may
sometimes be discovered. [31] They were bestowed by the emperors, or
assumed by the most powerful citizens, to denote their rank, their
honors, [32] and perhaps the claim of a pure and patrician descent: but
they float on the surface, without a series or a substance, the titles
of men, not the orders of government; [33] and it is only from the year
of Christ one thousand one hundred and forty-four that the establishment
of the senate is dated, as a glorious æra, in the acts of the city.
A new constitution was hastily framed by private ambition or popular
enthusiasm; nor could Rome, in the twelfth century, produce an antiquary
to explain, or a legislator to restore, the harmony and proportions of
the ancient model. The assembly of a free, of an armed, people,
will ever speak in loud and weighty acclamations. But the regular
distribution of the thirty-five tribes, the nice balance of the wealth
and numbers of the centuries, the debates of the adverse orators, and
the slow operations of votes and ballots, could not easily be adapted by
a blind multitude, ignorant of the arts, and insensible of the
benefits, of legal government. It was proposed by Arnold to revive
and discriminate the equestrian order; but what could be the motive
or measure of such distinction? [34] The pecuniary qualification of the
knights must have been reduced to the poverty of the times: those times
no longer required their civil functions of judges and farmers of the
revenue; and their primitive duty, their military service on horseback,
was more nobly supplied by feudal tenures and the spirit of chivalry.
The jurisprudence of the republic was useless and unknown: the nations
and families of Italy who lived under the Roman and Barbaric laws were
insensibly mingled in a common mass; and some faint tradition, some
imperfect fragments, preserved the memory of the Code and Pandects of
Justinian. With their liberty the Romans might doubtless have restored
the appellation and office of consuls; had they not disdained a title so
promiscuously adopted in the Italian cities, that it has finally settled
on the humble station of the agents of commerce in a foreign land. But
the rights of the tribunes, the formidable word that arrested the
public counsels, suppose or must produce a legitimate democracy. The
old patricians were the subjects, the modern barons the tyrants, of the
state; nor would the enemies of peace and order, who insulted the
vicar of Christ, have long respected the unarmed sanctity of a plebeian
magistrate. [35]

[Footnote 30: Ducange (Gloss. Latinitatis Mediæ et Infimæ Ætatis,
Decarchones, tom. ii. p. 726) gives me a quotation from Blondus, (Decad.
ii. l. ii.:) Duo consules ex nobilitate quotannis fiebant, qui ad
vetustum consulum exemplar summærerum præessent. And in Sigonius (de
Regno Italiæ, l. v. Opp. tom. ii. p. 400) I read of the consuls and
tribunes of the xth century. Both Blondus, and even Sigonius, too
freely copied the classic method of supplying from reason or fancy the
deficiency of records.]

[Footnote 31: In the panegyric of Berengarius (Muratori, Script. Rer.
Ital. tom. ii. P. i. p. 408) a Roman is mentioned as consulis natus in
the beginning of the xth century. Muratori (Dissert. v.) discovers, in
the years 952 and 956, Gratianus in Dei nomine consul et dux, Georgius
consul et dux; and in 1015, Romanus, brother of Gregory VIII., proudly,
but vaguely, styles himself consul et dux et omnium Roma norum senator.]

[Footnote 32: As late as the xth century, the Greek emperors conferred
on the dukes of Venice, Naples, Amalphi, &c., the title of upatoV
or consuls, (see Chron. Sagornini, passim;) and the successors of
Charlemagne would not abdicate any of their prerogative. But in general
the names of _consul_ and _senator_, which may be found among the French
and Germans, signify no more than count and lord, (_Signeur_, Ducange
Glossar.) The monkish writers are often ambitious of fine classic
words.]

[Footnote 33: The most constitutional form is a diploma of Otho III.,
(A. D 998,) consulibus senatûs populique Romani; but the act is probably
spurious. At the coronation of Henry I., A.D. 1014, the historian
Dithmar (apud Muratori, Dissert. xxiii.) describes him, a senatoribus
duodecim vallatum, quorum sex rasi barbâ, alii prolixâ, mystice
incedebant cum baculis. The senate is mentioned in the panegyric of
Berengarius, (p. 406.)]

[Footnote 34: In ancient Rome the equestrian order was not ranked
with the senate and people as a third branch of the republic till the
consulship of Cicero, who assumes the merit of the establishment,
(Plin. Hist. Natur. xxxiii. 3. Beaufort, République Romaine, tom. i. p.
144--155.)]

[Footnote 35: The republican plan of Arnold of Brescia is thus stated by
Gunther:--
     Quin etiam titulos urbis renovare vetustos;
     Nomine plebeio secernere nomen equestre,
     Jura tribunorum, sanctum reparare senatum,
     Et senio fessas mutasque reponere leges.
     Lapsa ruinosis, et adhuc pendentia muris
     Reddere primævo Capitolia prisca nitori.
But of these reformations, some were no more than ideas, others no more
than words.]

In the revolution of the twelfth century, which gave a new existence and
æra to Rome, we may observe the real and important events that marked or
confirmed her political independence. I. The Capitoline hill, one of
her seven eminences, [36] is about four hundred yards in length, and two
hundred in breadth. A flight of a hundred steps led to the summit of the
Tarpeian rock; and far steeper was the ascent before the declivities had
been smoothed and the precipices filled by the ruins of fallen edifices.
From the earliest ages, the Capitol had been used as a temple in peace,
a fortress in war: after the loss of the city, it maintained a siege
against the victorious Gauls, and the sanctuary of the empire was
occupied, assaulted, and burnt, in the civil wars of Vitellius and
Vespasian. [37] The temples of Jupiter and his kindred deities had
crumbled into dust; their place was supplied by monasteries and houses;
and the solid walls, the long and shelving porticos, were decayed or
ruined by the lapse of time. It was the first act of the Romans, an
act of freedom, to restore the strength, though not the beauty, of the
Capitol; to fortify the seat of their arms and counsels; and as often
as they ascended the hill, the coldest minds must have glowed with the
remembrance of their ancestors. II. The first Cæsars had been invested
with the exclusive coinage of the gold and silver; to the senate they
abandoned the baser metal of bronze or copper: [38] the emblems and
legends were inscribed on a more ample field by the genius of flattery;
and the prince was relieved from the care of celebrating his own
virtues. The successors of Diocletian despised even the flattery of the
senate: their royal officers at Rome, and in the provinces, assumed the
sole direction of the mint; and the same prerogative was inherited by
the Gothic kings of Italy, and the long series of the Greek, the French,
and the German dynasties. After an abdication of eight hundred years,
the Roman senate asserted this honorable and lucrative privilege; which
was tacitly renounced by the popes, from Paschal the Second to the
establishment of their residence beyond the Alps. Some of these
republican coins of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries are shown in
the cabinets of the curious. On one of these, a gold medal, Christ is
depictured holding in his left hand a book with this inscription: "The
vow of the Roman senate and people: Rome the capital of the world;" on
the reverse, St. Peter delivering a banner to a kneeling senator in
his cap and gown, with the name and arms of his family impressed on a
shield. [39] III. With the empire, the præfect of the city had declined
to a municipal officer; yet he still exercised in the last appeal the
civil and criminal jurisdiction; and a drawn sword, which he received
from the successors of Otho, was the mode of his investiture and the
emblem of his functions. [40] The dignity was confined to the noble
families of Rome: the choice of the people was ratified by the pope; but
a triple oath of fidelity must have often embarrassed the præfect in the
conflict of adverse duties. [41] A servant, in whom they possessed but a
third share, was dismissed by the independent Romans: in his place
they elected a patrician; but this title, which Charlemagne had not
disdained, was too lofty for a citizen or a subject; and, after the
first fervor of rebellion, they consented without reluctance to the
restoration of the præfect. About fifty years after this event, Innocent
the Third, the most ambitious, or at least the most fortunate, of the
Pontiffs, delivered the Romans and himself from this badge of foreign
dominion: he invested the præfect with a banner instead of a sword,
and absolved him from all dependence of oaths or service to the
German emperors. [42] In his place an ecclesiastic, a present or future
cardinal, was named by the pope to the civil government of Rome; but his
jurisdiction has been reduced to a narrow compass; and in the days of
freedom, the right or exercise was derived from the senate and people.
IV. After the revival of the senate, [43] the conscript fathers (if I
may use the expression) were invested with the legislative and executive
power; but their views seldom reached beyond the present day; and that
day was most frequently disturbed by violence and tumult. In its utmost
plenitude, the order or assembly consisted of fifty-six senators, [44]
the most eminent of whom were distinguished by the title of counsellors:
they were nominated, perhaps annually, by the people; and a previous
choice of their electors, ten persons in each region, or parish, might
afford a basis for a free and permanent constitution. The popes, who in
this tempest submitted rather to bend than to break, confirmed by treaty
the establishment and privileges of the senate, and expected from time,
peace, and religion, the restoration of their government. The motives
of public and private interest might sometimes draw from the Romans an
occasional and temporary sacrifice of their claims; and they renewed
their oath of allegiance to the successor of St. Peter and Constantine,
the lawful head of the church and the republic. [45]

[Footnote 36: After many disputes among the antiquaries of Rome, it
seems determined, that the summit of the Capitoline hill next the river
is strictly the Mons Tarpeius, the Arx; and that on the other summit,
the church and convent of Araceli, the barefoot friars of St. Francis
occupy the temple of Jupiter, (Nardini, Roma Antica, l. v. c. 11--16. *
Note: The authority of Nardini is now vigorously impugned, and
the question of the Arx and the Temple of Jupiter revived, with new
arguments by Niebuhr and his accomplished follower, M. Bunsen. Roms
Beschreibung, vol. iii. p. 12, et seqq.--M.]

[Footnote 37: Tacit. Hist. iii. 69, 70.]

[Footnote 38: This partition of the noble and baser metals between the
emperor and senate must, however, be adopted, not as a positive fact,
but as the probable opinion of the best antiquaries, * (see the Science
des Medailles of the Père Joubert, tom. ii. p. 208--211, in the improved
and scarce edition of the Baron de la Bastie. *
Note: Dr. Cardwell (Lecture on Ancient Coins, p. 70, et seq.) assigns
convincing reasons in support of this opinion.--M.]

[Footnote 39: In his xxviith dissertation on the Antiquities of Italy,
(tom. ii. p. 559--569,) Muratori exhibits a series of the senatorian
coins, which bore the obscure names of _Affortiati_, _Infortiati_,
_Provisini_, _Paparini_. During this period, all the popes, without
excepting Boniface VIII, abstained from the right of coining, which was
resumed by his successor Benedict XI., and regularly exercised in the
court of Avignon.]

[Footnote 40: A German historian, Gerard of Reicherspeg (in Baluz.
Miscell. tom. v. p. 64, apud Schmidt, Hist. des Allemands, tom. iii.
p. 265) thus describes the constitution of Rome in the xith century:
Grandiora urbis et orbis negotia spectant ad Romanum pontificem itemque
ad Romanum Imperatorem, sive illius vicarium urbis præfectum, qui de suâ
dignitate respicit utrumque, videlicet dominum papam cui facit hominum,
et dominum imperatorem a quo accipit suæ potestatis insigne, scilicet
gladium exertum.]

[Footnote 41: The words of a contemporary writer (Pandulph. Pisan. in
Vit. Paschal. II. p. 357, 358) describe the election and oath of the
præfect in 1118, inconsultis patribus.... loca præfectoria.... Laudes
præfectoriæ.... comitiorum applausum.... juraturum populo in ambonem
sublevant.... confirmari eum in urbe præfectum petunt.]

[Footnote 42: Urbis præfectum ad ligiam fidelitatem recepit, et per
mantum quod illi donavit de præfecturâ eum publice investivit, qui usque
ad id tempus juramento fidelitatis imperatori fuit obligatus et ab eo
præfecturæ tenuit honorem, (Gesta Innocent. III. in Muratori, tom. iii.
P. i. p. 487.)]

[Footnote 43: See Otho Frising. Chron. vii. 31, de Gest. Frederic. I.,
l. i. c. 27.]

[Footnote 44: Cur countryman, Roger Hoveden, speaks of the single
senators, of the _Capuzzi_ family, &c., quorum temporibus melius
regebatur Roma quam nunc (A.D. 1194) est temporibus lvi. senatorum,
(Ducange, Gloss. tom. vi. p. 191, Senatores.)]

[Footnote 45: Muratori (dissert. xlii. tom. iii. p. 785--788) has
published an original treaty: Concordia inter D. nostrum papam Clementem
III. et senatores populi Romani super regalibus et aliis dignitatibus
urbis, &c., anno 44º senatûs. The senate speaks, and speaks with
authority: Reddimus ad præsens.... habebimus.... dabitis presbetria....
jurabimus pacem et fidelitatem, &c. A chartula de Tenementis Tusculani,
dated in the 47th year of the same æra, and confirmed decreto amplissimi
ordinis senatûs, acclamatione P. R. publice Capitolio consistentis.
It is there we find the difference of senatores consiliarii and simple
senators, (Muratori, dissert. xlii. tom. iii. p. 787--789.)]

The union and vigor of a public council was dissolved in a lawless
city; and the Romans soon adopted a more strong and simple mode of
administration. They condensed the name and authority of the senate in
a single magistrate, or two colleagues; and as they were changed at
the end of a year, or of six months, the greatness of the trust was
compensated by the shortness of the term. But in this transient reign,
the senators of Rome indulged their avarice and ambition: their justice
was perverted by the interest of their family and faction; and as they
punished only their enemies, they were obeyed only by their adherents.
Anarchy, no longer tempered by the pastoral care of their bishop,
admonished the Romans that they were incapable of governing themselves;
and they sought abroad those blessings which they were hopeless of
finding at home. In the same age, and from the same motives, most of
the Italian republics were prompted to embrace a measure, which, however
strange it may seem, was adapted to their situation, and productive of
the most salutary effects. [46] They chose, in some foreign but friendly
city, an impartial magistrate of noble birth and unblemished character,
a soldier and a statesman, recommended by the voice of fame and his
country, to whom they delegated for a time the supreme administration
of peace and war. The compact between the governor and the governed was
sealed with oaths and subscriptions; and the duration of his power, the
measure of his stipend, the nature of their mutual obligations, were
defined with scrupulous precision. They swore to obey him as their
lawful superior: he pledged his faith to unite the indifference of a
stranger with the zeal of a patriot. At his choice, four or six
knights and civilians, his assessors in arms and justice, attended the
_Podesta_, [47] who maintained at his own expense a decent retinue of
servants and horses: his wife, his son, his brother, who might bias the
affections of the judge, were left behind: during the exercise of his
office he was not permitted to purchase land, to contract an alliance,
or even to accept an invitation in the house of a citizen; nor could
he honorably depart till he had satisfied the complaints that might be
urged against his government.

[Footnote 46: Muratori (dissert. xlv. tom. iv. p. 64--92) has fully
explained this mode of government; and the _Occulus Pastoralis_, which
he has given at the end, is a treatise or sermon on the duties of these
foreign magistrates.]

[Footnote 47: In the Latin writers, at least of the silver age, the
title of _Potestas_ was transferred from the office to the magistrate:--
     Hujus qui trahitur prætextam sumere mavis;
     An Fidenarum Gabiorumque esse _Potestas_.
     Juvenal. Satir. x. 99.11]
