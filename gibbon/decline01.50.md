## Chapter XV: Progress Of The Christian Religion.--Part VI.

V. But the human character, however it may be exalted or depressed by a
temporary enthusiasm, will return by degrees to its proper and natural
level, and will resume those passions that seem the most adapted to its
present condition. The primitive Christians were dead to the business
and pleasures of the world; but their love of action, which could never
be entirely extinguished, soon revived, and found a new occupation in
the government of the church. A separate society, which attacked the
established religion of the empire, was obliged to adopt some form
of internal policy, and to appoint a sufficient number of ministers,
intrusted not only with the spiritual functions, but even with the
temporal direction of the Christian commonwealth. The safety of that
society, its honor, its aggrandizement, were productive, even in the
most pious minds, of a spirit of patriotism, such as the first of
the Romans had felt for the republic, and sometimes of a similar
indifference, in the use of whatever means might probably conduce to so
desirable an end. The ambition of raising themselves or their friends
to the honors and offices of the church, was disguised by the laudable
intention of devoting to the public benefit the power and consideration,
which, for that purpose only, it became their duty to solicit. In the
exercise of their functions, they were frequently called upon to detect
the errors of heresy or the arts of faction, to oppose the designs
of perfidious brethren, to stigmatize their characters with deserved
infamy, and to expel them from the bosom of a society whose peace and
happiness they had attempted to disturb. The ecclesiastical governors of
the Christians were taught to unite the wisdom of the serpent with the
innocence of the dove; but as the former was refined, so the latter was
insensibly corrupted, by the habits of government. If the church as
well as in the world, the persons who were placed in any public station
rendered themselves considerable by their eloquence and firmness, by
their knowledge of mankind, and by their dexterity in business; and
while they concealed from others, and perhaps from themselves, the
secret motives of their conduct, they too frequently relapsed into all
the turbulent passions of active life, which were tinctured with an
additional degree of bitterness and obstinacy from the infusion of
spiritual zeal.

The government of the church has often been the subject, as well as
the prize, of religious contention. The hostile disputants of Rome,
of Paris, of Oxford, and of Geneva, have alike struggled to reduce the
primitive and apostolic model [104] to the respective standards of their
own policy. The few who have pursued this inquiry with more candor and
impartiality, are of opinion, [105] that the apostles declined the office
of legislation, and rather chose to endure some partial scandals and
divisions, than to exclude the Christians of a future age from the
liberty of varying their forms of ecclesiastical government according
to the changes of times and circumstances. The scheme of policy, which,
under their approbation, was adopted for the use of the first century,
may be discovered from the practice of Jerusalem, of Ephesus, or of
Corinth. The societies which were instituted in the cities of the Roman
empire, were united only by the ties of faith and charity. Independence
and equality formed the basis of their internal constitution. The
want of discipline and human learning was supplied by the occasional
assistance of the prophets, [106] who were called to that function
without distinction of age, of sex, [1061] or of natural abilities, and who,
as often as they felt the divine impulse, poured forth the effusions
of the Spirit in the assembly of the faithful. But these extraordinary
gifts were frequently abused or misapplied by the prophetic teachers.
They displayed them at an improper season, presumptuously disturbed
the service of the assembly, and, by their pride or mistaken zeal, they
introduced, particularly into the apostolic church of Corinth, a long
and melancholy train of disorders. [107] As the institution of prophets
became useless, and even pernicious, their powers were withdrawn, and
their office abolished. The public functions of religion were solely
intrusted to the established ministers of the church, the bishops and
the presbyters; two appellations which, in their first origin, appear
to have distinguished the same office and the same order of persons.
The name of Presbyter was expressive of their age, or rather of their
gravity and wisdom. The title of Bishop denoted their inspection over
the faith and manners of the Christians who were committed to their
pastoral care. In proportion to the respective numbers of the faithful,
a larger or smaller number of these episcopal presbyters guided each
infant congregation with equal authority and with united counsels.
[108]

[Footnote 104: The aristocratical party in France, as well as in
England, has strenuously maintained the divine origin of bishops.
But the Calvinistical presbyters were impatient of a superior; and the
Roman Pontiff refused to acknowledge an equal. See Fra Paolo.]

[Footnote 105: In the history of the Christian hierarchy, I have, for
the most part, followed the learned and candid Mosheim.]

[Footnote 106: For the prophets of the primitive church, see Mosheim,
Dissertationes ad Hist. Eccles. pertinentes, tom. ii. p. 132--208.]

[Footnote 1061: St. Paul distinctly reproves the intrusion of females into
the prophets office. 1 Cor. xiv. 34, 35. 1 Tim. ii. 11.--M.]

[Footnote 107: See the epistles of St. Paul, and of Clemens, to the
Corinthians. * Note: The first ministers established in the church were
the deacons, appointed at Jerusalem, seven in number; they were charged
with the distribution of the alms; even females had a share in this
employment. After the deacons came the elders or priests, charged with
the maintenance of order and decorum in the community, and to act every
where in its name. The bishops were afterwards charged to watch over the
faith and the instruction of the disciples: the apostles themselves
appointed several bishops. Tertullian, (adv. Marium, c. v.,) Clement of
Alexandria, and many fathers of the second and third century, do not
permit us to doubt this fact. The equality of rank between these
different functionaries did not prevent their functions being, even in
their origin, distinct; they became subsequently still more so. See
Plank, Geschichte der Christ. Kirch. Verfassung., vol. i. p. 24.--G. On
this extremely obscure subject, which has been so much perplexed by
passion and interest, it is impossible to justify any opinion without
entering into long and controversial details.----It must be admitted, in
opposition to Plank, that in the New Testament, several words are
sometimes indiscriminately used. (Acts xx. v. 17, comp. with 28 Tit. i.
5 and 7. Philip. i. 1.) But it is as clear, that as soon as we can
discern the form of church government, at a period closely bordering
upon, if not within, the apostolic age, it appears with a bishop at the
head of each community, holding some superiority over the presbyters.
Whether he was, as Gibbon from Mosheim supposes, merely an elective head
of the College of Presbyters, (for this we have, in fact, no valid
authority,) or whether his distinct functions were established on
apostolic authority, is still contested. The universal submission to
this episcopacy, in every part of the Christian world appears to me
strongly to favor the latter view.--M.]

[Footnote 108: Hooker's Ecclesiastical Polity, l. vii.]

But the most perfect equality of freedom requires the directing hand
of a superior magistrate: and the order of public deliberations soon
introduces the office of a president, invested at least with
the authority of collecting the sentiments, and of executing the
resolutions, of the assembly. A regard for the public tranquillity,
which would so frequently have been interrupted by annual or by
occasional elections, induced the primitive Christians to constitute an
honorable and perpetual magistracy, and to choose one of the wisest and
most holy among their presbyterians to execute, during his life,
the duties of their ecclesiastical governor. It was under these
circumstances that the lofty title of Bishop began to raise itself above
the humble appellation of Presbyter; and while the latter remained the
most natural distinction for the members of every Christian senate, the
former was appropriated to the dignity of its new president. [109] The
advantages of this episcopal form of government, which appears to
have been introduced before the end of the first century, [110] were
so obvious, and so important for the future greatness, as well as the
present peace, of Christianity, that it was adopted without delay by all
the societies which were already scattered over the empire, had acquired
in a very early period the sanction of antiquity, [111] and is still
revered by the most powerful churches, both of the East and of the West,
as a primitive and even as a divine establishment. [112] It is needless
to observe, that the pious and humble presbyters, who were first
dignified with the episcopal title, could not possess, and would
probably have rejected, the power and pomp which now encircles the
tiara of the Roman pontiff, or the mitre of a German prelate. But we
may define, in a few words, the narrow limits of their original
jurisdiction, which was chiefly of a spiritual, though in some instances
of a temporal nature. [113] It consisted in the administration of
the sacraments and discipline of the church, the superintendency of
religious ceremonies, which imperceptibly increased in number and
variety, the consecration of ecclesiastical ministers, to whom the
bishop assigned their respective functions, the management of the public
fund, and the determination of all such differences as the faithful were
unwilling to expose before the tribunal of an idolatrous judge. These
powers, during a short period, were exercised according to the advice
of the presbyteral college, and with the consent and approbation of the
assembly of Christians. The primitive bishops were considered only as
the first of their equals, and the honorable servants of a free people.
Whenever the episcopal chair became vacant by death, a new president was
chosen among the presbyters by the suffrages of the whole congregation,
every member of which supposed himself invested with a sacred and
sacerdotal character. [114]

[Footnote 109: See Jerome and Titum, c. i. and Epistol. 85, (in the
Benedictine edition, 101,) and the elaborate apology of Blondel, pro
sententia Hieronymi. The ancient state, as it is described by Jerome, of
the bishop and presbyters of Alexandria, receives a remarkable
confirmation from the patriarch Eutychius, (Annal. tom. i. p. 330, Vers
Pocock;) whose testimony I know not how to reject, in spite of all the
objections of the learned Pearson in his Vindiciae Ignatianae, part i.
c. 11.]

[Footnote 110: See the introduction to the Apocalypse. Bishops, under
the name of angels, were already instituted in the seven cities of Asia.
And yet the epistle of Clemens (which is probably of as ancient a date)
does not lead us to discover any traces of episcopacy either at Corinth
or Rome.]

[Footnote 111: Nulla Ecclesia sine Episcopo, has been a fact as well as
a maxim since the time of Tertullian and Irenaeus.]

[Footnote 112: After we have passed the difficulties of the first
century, we find the episcopal government universally established, till
it was interrupted by the republican genius of the Swiss and German
reformers.]

[Footnote 113: See Mosheim in the first and second centuries. Ignatius
(ad Smyrnaeos, c. 3, &c.) is fond of exalting the episcopal dignity. Le
Clerc (Hist. Eccles. p. 569) very bluntly censures his conduct, Mosheim,
with a more critical judgment, (p. 161,) suspects the purity even of the
smaller epistles.]

[Footnote 114: Nonne et Laici sacerdotes sumus? Tertullian, Exhort. ad
Castitat. c. 7. As the human heart is still the same, several of the
observations which Mr. Hume has made on Enthusiasm, (Essays, vol. i. p.
76, quarto edit.) may be applied even to real inspiration. * Note: This
expression was employed by the earlier Christian writers in the sense
used by St. Peter, 1 Ep ii. 9. It was the sanctity and virtue not the
power of priesthood, in which all Christians were to be equally
distinguished.--M.]

Such was the mild and equal constitution by which the Christians were
governed more than a hundred years after the death of the apostles.
Every society formed within itself a separate and independent republic;
and although the most distant of these little states maintained a
mutual as well as friendly intercourse of letters and deputations,
the Christian world was not yet connected by any supreme authority or
legislative assembly. As the numbers of the faithful were gradually
multiplied, they discovered the advantages that might result from a
closer union of their interest and designs. Towards the end of the
second century, the churches of Greece and Asia adopted the useful
institutions of provincial synods, [1141] and they may justly be supposed to
have borrowed the model of a representative council from the celebrated
examples of their own country, the Amphictyons, the Achaean league, or
the assemblies of the Ionian cities. It was soon established as a custom
and as a law, that the bishops of the independent churches should meet
in the capital of the province at the stated periods of spring and
autumn. Their deliberations were assisted by the advice of a few
distinguished presbyters, and moderated by the presence of a listening
multitude. [115] Their decrees, which were styled Canons, regulated every
important controversy of faith and discipline; and it was natural to
believe that a liberal effusion of the Holy Spirit would be poured
on the united assembly of the delegates of the Christian people. The
institution of synods was so well suited to private ambition, and
to public interest, that in the space of a few years it was received
throughout the whole empire. A regular correspondence was established
between the provincial councils, which mutually communicated and
approved their respective proceedings; and the catholic church soon
assumed the form, and acquired the strength, of a great foederative
republic. [116]

[Footnote 1141: The synods were not the first means taken by the insulated
churches to enter into communion and to assume a corporate character.
The dioceses were first formed by the union of several country churches
with a church in a city: many churches in one city uniting among
themselves, or joining a more considerable church, became metropolitan.
The dioceses were not formed before the beginning of the second century:
before that time the Christians had not established sufficient churches
in the country to stand in need of that union. It is towards the
middle of the same century that we discover the first traces of the
metropolitan constitution. (Probably the country churches were founded
in general by missionaries from those in the city, and would preserve a
natural connection with the parent church.)--M. ----The provincial
synods did not commence till towards the middle of the third century,
and were not the first synods. History gives us distinct notions of the
synods, held towards the end of the second century, at Ephesus at
Jerusalem, at Pontus, and at Rome, to put an end to the disputes which
had arisen between the Latin and Asiatic churches about the celebration
of Easter. But these synods were not subject to any regular form or
periodical return; this regularity was first established with the
provincial synods, which were formed by a union of the bishops of a
district, subject to a metropolitan. Plank, p. 90. Geschichte der
Christ. Kirch. Verfassung--G]

[Footnote 115: Acta Concil. Carthag. apud Cyprian. edit. Fell, p. 158.
This council was composed of eighty-seven bishops from the provinces of
Mauritania, Numidia, and Africa; some presbyters and deacons assisted at
the assembly; praesente plebis maxima parte.]

[Footnote 116: Aguntur praeterea per Graecias illas, certis in locis
concilia, &c Tertullian de Jejuniis, c. 13. The African mentions it as a
recent and foreign institution. The coalition of the Christian churches
is very ably explained by Mosheim, p. 164 170.]

As the legislative authority of the particular churches was insensibly
superseded by the use of councils, the bishops obtained by their
alliance a much larger share of executive and arbitrary power; and as
soon as they were connected by a sense of their common interest, they
were enabled to attack with united vigor, the original rights of their
clergy and people. The prelates of the third century imperceptibly
changed the language of exhortation into that of command, scattered the
seeds of future usurpations, and supplied, by scripture allegories and
declamatory rhetoric, their deficiency of force and of reason. They
exalted the unity and power of the church, as it was represented in the
Episcopal Office, of which every bishop enjoyed an equal and undivided
portion. [117] Princes and magistrates, it was often repeated, might
boast an earthly claim to a transitory dominion; it was the episcopal
authority alone which was derived from the Deity, and extended itself
over this and over another world. The bishops were the vicegerents of
Christ, the successors of the apostles, and the mystic substitutes
of the high priest of the Mosaic law. Their exclusive privilege of
conferring the sacerdotal character, invaded the freedom both of
clerical and of popular elections; and if, in the administration of
the church, they still consulted the judgment of the presbyters, or the
inclination of the people, they most carefully inculcated the merit of
such a voluntary condescension. The bishops acknowledged the supreme
authority which resided in the assembly of their brethren; but in the
government of his peculiar diocese, each of them exacted from his
flock the same implicit obedience as if that favorite metaphor had been
literally just, and as if the shepherd had been of a more exalted nature
than that of his sheep. [118] This obedience, however, was not imposed
without some efforts on one side, and some resistance on the other. The
democratical part of the constitution was, in many places, very warmly
supported by the zealous or interested opposition of the inferior
clergy. But their patriotism received the ignominious epithets of
faction and schism; and the episcopal cause was indebted for its rapid
progress to the labors of many active prelates, who, like Cyprian of
Carthage, could reconcile the arts of the most ambitious statesman with
the Christian virtues which seem adapted to the character of a saint and
martyr. [119]

[Footnote 117: Cyprian, in his admired treatise De Unitate Ecclesiae. p.
75--86]

[Footnote 118: We may appeal to the whole tenor of Cyprian's conduct, of
his doctrine, and of his epistles. Le Clerc, in a short life of Cyprian,
(Bibliotheque Universelle, tom. xii. p. 207--378,) has laid him open
with great freedom and accuracy.]

[Footnote 119: If Novatus, Felicissimus, &c., whom the Bishop of
Carthage expelled from his church, and from Africa, were not the most
detestable monsters of wickedness, the zeal of Cyprian must occasionally
have prevailed over his veracity. For a very just account of these
obscure quarrels, see Mosheim, p. 497--512.]

The same causes which at first had destroyed the equality of the
presbyters introduced among the bishops a preeminence of rank, and from
thence a superiority of jurisdiction. As often as in the spring and
autumn they met in provincial synod, the difference of personal merit
and reputation was very sensibly felt among the members of the assembly,
and the multitude was governed by the wisdom and eloquence of the few.
But the order of public proceedings required a more regular and less
invidious distinction; the office of perpetual presidents in the
councils of each province was conferred on the bishops of the principal
city; and these aspiring prelates, who soon acquired the lofty titles of
Metropolitans and Primates, secretly prepared themselves to usurp over
their episcopal brethren the same authority which the bishops had so
lately assumed above the college of presbyters. [120] Nor was it long
before an emulation of preeminence and power prevailed among the
Metropolitans themselves, each of them affecting to display, in the most
pompous terms, the temporal honors and advantages of the city over which
he presided; the numbers and opulence of the Christians who were subject
to their pastoral care; the saints and martyrs who had arisen among
them; and the purity with which they preserved the tradition of the
faith, as it had been transmitted through a series of orthodox bishops
from the apostle or the apostolic disciple, to whom the foundation of
their church was ascribed. [121] From every cause, either of a civil or
of an ecclesiastical nature, it was easy to foresee that Rome must enjoy
the respect, and would soon claim the obedience of the provinces. The
society of the faithful bore a just proportion to the capital of the
empire; and the Roman church was the greatest, the most numerous,
and, in regard to the West, the most ancient of all the Christian
establishments, many of which had received their religion from the pious
labors of her missionaries. Instead of one apostolic founder, the utmost
boast of Antioch, of Ephesus, or of Corinth, the banks of the Tyber were
supposed to have been honored with the preaching and martyrdom of the
two most eminent among the apostles; [122] and the bishops of Rome
very prudently claimed the inheritance of whatsoever prerogatives were
attributed either to the person or to the office of St. Peter. [123]
The bishops of Italy and of the provinces were disposed to allow them
a primacy of order and association (such was their very accurate
expression) in the Christian aristocracy. [124] But the power of a
monarch was rejected with abhorrence, and the aspiring genius of
Rome experienced from the nations of Asia and Africa a more vigorous
resistance to her spiritual, than she had formerly done to her temporal,
dominion. The patriotic Cyprian, who ruled with the most absolute
sway the church of Carthage and the provincial synods, opposed with
resolution and success the ambition of the Roman pontiff, artfully
connected his own cause with that of the eastern bishops, and, like
Hannibal, sought out new allies in the heart of Asia. [125] If this Punic
war was carried on without any effusion of blood, it was owing much
less to the moderation than to the weakness of the contending prelates.
Invectives and excommunications were their only weapons; and these,
during the progress of the whole controversy, they hurled against each
other with equal fury and devotion. The hard necessity of censuring
either a pope, or a saint and martyr, distresses the modern Catholics
whenever they are obliged to relate the particulars of a dispute in
which the champions of religion indulged such passions as seem much more
adapted to the senate or to the camp. [126]

the heretics the right of prescription, as it was held by the apostolic
churches.]

[Footnote 122: The journey of St. Peter to Rome is mentioned by most of
the ancients, (see Eusebius, ii. 25,) maintained by all the Catholics,
allowed by some Protestants, (see Pearson and Dodwell de Success.
Episcop. Roman,) but has been vigorously attacked by Spanheim,
(Miscellanes Sacra, iii. 3.) According to Father Hardouin, the monks of
the thirteenth century, who composed the Aeneid, represented St. Peter
under the allegorical character of the Trojan hero. * Note: It is quite
clear that, strictly speaking, the church of Rome was not founded by
either of these apostles. St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans proves
undeniably the flourishing state of the church before his visit to the
city; and many Roman Catholic writers have given up the impracticable
task of reconciling with chronology any visit of St. Peter to Rome
before the end of the reign of Claudius, or the beginning of that of
Nero.--M.]

[Footnote 123: It is in French only that the famous
allusion to St. Peter's name is exact. Tu es Pierre, et sur cette
pierre.--The same is imperfect in Greek, Latin, Italian, &c., and
totally unintelligible in our Tentonic languages. * Note: It is exact in
Syro-Chaldaic, the language in which it was spoken by Jesus Christ. (St.
Matt. xvi. 17.) Peter was called Cephas; and cepha signifies base,
foundation, rock--G.]

Clere (Hist. Eccles. p. 764) and Mosheim (p. 258, 578) labor in the
interpretation of these passages. But the loose and rhetorical style of
the fathers often appears favorable to the pretensions of Rome.]

Caesarea, to Stephen, bishop of Rome, ap. Cyprian, Epistol. 75.]

The progress of the ecclesiastical authority gave birth to the memorable
distinction of the laity and of the clergy, which had been unknown
to the Greeks and Romans. [127] The former of these appellations
comprehended the body of the Christian people; the latter, according to
the signification of the word, was appropriated to the chosen portion
that had been set apart for the service of religion; a celebrated order
of men, which has furnished the most important, though not always the
most edifying, subjects for modern history. Their mutual hostilities
sometimes disturbed the peace of the infant church, but their zeal and
activity were united in the common cause, and the love of power, which
(under the most artful disguises) could insinuate itself into the
breasts of bishops and martyrs, animated them to increase the number of
their subjects, and to enlarge the limits of the Christian empire. They
were destitute of any temporal force, and they were for a long
time discouraged and oppressed, rather than assisted, by the civil
magistrate; but they had acquired, and they employed within their own
society, the two most efficacious instruments of government, rewards and
punishments; the former derived from the pious liberality, the latter
from the devout apprehensions, of the faithful.

was established before the time of Tertullian.]
