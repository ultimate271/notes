The conflict of Rome and Persia was prolonged from the death of Craesus
to the reign of Heraclius. An experience of seven hundred years might
convince the rival nations of the impossibility of maintaining their
conquests beyond the fatal limits of the Tigris and Euphrates. Yet
the emulation of Trajan and Julian was awakened by the trophies of
Alexander, and the sovereigns of Persia indulged the ambitious hope of
restoring the empire of Cyrus. [1] Such extraordinary efforts of power
and courage will always command the attention of posterity; but the
events by which the fate of nations is not materially changed, leave a
faint impression on the page of history, and the patience of the reader
would be exhausted by the repetition of the same hostilities, undertaken
without cause, prosecuted without glory, and terminated without effect.
The arts of negotiation, unknown to the simple greatness of the senate
and the Caesars, were assiduously cultivated by the Byzantine princes;
and the memorials of their perpetual embassies [2] repeat, with the
same uniform prolixity, the language of falsehood and declamation, the
insolence of the Barbarians, and the servile temper of the tributary
Greeks. Lamenting the barren superfluity of materials, I have studied to
compress the narrative of these uninteresting transactions: but the just
Nushirvan is still applauded as the model of Oriental kings, and the
ambition of his grandson Chosroes prepared the revolution of the East,
which was speedily accomplished by the arms and the religion of the
successors of Mahomet.

terminos, seque invasurum possessa Cyro et post Alexandro, per
vaniloquentiam ac minas jaciebat. Tacit. Annal. vi. 31. Such was the
language of the Arsacides. I have repeatedly marked the lofty claims of
the Sassanians.]

[Footnote 2: See the embassies of Menander, extracted and preserved in
the tenth century by the order of Constantine Porphyrogenitus.]

In the useless altercations, that precede and justify the quarrels of
princes, the Greeks and the Barbarians accused each other of violating
the peace which had been concluded between the two empires about four
years before the death of Justinian. The sovereign of Persia and India
aspired to reduce under his obedience the province of Yemen or Arabia
[3] Felix; the distant land of myrrh and frankincense, which had
escaped, rather than opposed, the conquerors of the East. After the
defeat of Abrahah under the walls of Mecca, the discord of his sons
and brothers gave an easy entrance to the Persians: they chased the
strangers of Abyssinia beyond the Red Sea; and a native prince of the
ancient Homerites was restored to the throne as the vassal or viceroy
of the great Nushirvan. [4] But the nephew of Justinian declared his
resolution to avenge the injuries of his Christian ally the prince of
Abyssinia, as they suggested a decent pretence to discontinue the annual
tribute, which was poorly disguised by the name of pension. The churches
of Persarmenia were oppressed by the intolerant spirit of the Magi;
[411] they secretly invoked the protector of the Christians, and, after
the pious murder of their satraps, the rebels were avowed and supported
as the brethren and subjects of the Roman emperor. The complaints of
Nushirvan were disregarded by the Byzantine court; Justin yielded to the
importunities of the Turks, who offered an alliance against the common
enemy; and the Persian monarchy was threatened at the same instant by
the united forces of Europe, of Aethiopia, and of Scythia. At the age
of fourscore the sovereign of the East would perhaps have chosen the
peaceful enjoyment of his glory and greatness; but as soon as war became
inevitable, he took the field with the alacrity of youth, whilst the
aggressor trembled in the palace of Constantinople. Nushirvan, or
Chosroes, conducted in person the siege of Dara; and although that
important fortress had been left destitute of troops and magazines, the
valor of the inhabitants resisted above five months the archers, the
elephants, and the military engines of the Great King. In the mean while
his general Adarman advanced from Babylon, traversed the desert, passed
the Euphrates, insulted the suburbs of Antioch, reduced to ashes the
city of Apamea, and laid the spoils of Syria at the feet of his master,
whose perseverance in the midst of winter at length subverted the
bulwark of the East. But these losses, which astonished the provinces
and the court, produced a salutary effect in the repentance and
abdication of the emperor Justin: a new spirit arose in the Byzantine
councils; and a truce of three years was obtained by the prudence of
Tiberius. That seasonable interval was employed in the preparations
of war; and the voice of rumor proclaimed to the world, that from the
distant countries of the Alps and the Rhine, from Scythia, Maesia,
Pannonia, Illyricum, and Isauria, the strength of the Imperial cavalry
was reenforced with one hundred and fifty thousand soldiers. Yet the
king of Persia, without fear, or without faith, resolved to prevent
the attack of the enemy; again passed the Euphrates, and dismissing the
ambassadors of Tiberius, arrogantly commanded them to await his arrival
at Caesarea, the metropolis of the Cappadocian provinces. The two armies
encountered each other in the battle of Melitene: [412] the Barbarians,
who darkened the air with a cloud of arrows, prolonged their line, and
extended their wings across the plain; while the Romans, in deep and
solid bodies, expected to prevail in closer action, by the weight of
their swords and lances. A Scythian chief, who commanded their right
wing, suddenly turned the flank of the enemy, attacked their rear-guard
in the presence of Chosroes, penetrated to the midst of the camp,
pillaged the royal tent, profaned the eternal fire, loaded a train of
camels with the spoils of Asia, cut his way through the Persian host,
and returned with songs of victory to his friends, who had consumed the
day in single combats, or ineffectual skirmishes. The darkness of the
night, and the separation of the Romans, afforded the Persian monarch an
opportunity of revenge; and one of their camps was swept away by a rapid
and impetuous assault. But the review of his loss, and the consciousness
of his danger, determined Chosroes to a speedy retreat: he burnt, in his
passage, the vacant town of Melitene; and, without consulting the safety
of his troops, boldly swam the Euphrates on the back of an elephant.
After this unsuccessful campaign, the want of magazines, and perhaps
some inroad of the Turks, obliged him to disband or divide his forces;
the Romans were left masters of the field, and their general Justinian,
advancing to the relief of the Persarmenian rebels, erected his standard
on the banks of the Araxes. The great Pompey had formerly halted within
three days' march of the Caspian: [5] that inland sea was explored, for
the first time, by a hostile fleet, [6] and seventy thousand captives
were transplanted from Hyrcania to the Isle of Cyprus. On the return
of spring, Justinian descended into the fertile plains of Assyria;
the flames of war approached the residence of Nushirvan; the indignant
monarch sunk into the grave; and his last edict restrained his
successors from exposing their person in battle against the Romans.
[611] Yet the memory of this transient affront was lost in the glories
of a long reign; and his formidable enemies, after indulging their dream
of conquest, again solicited a short respite from the calamities of war.

[Footnote 3: The general independence of the Arabs, which cannot be
admitted without many limitations, is blindly asserted in a separate
dissertation of the authors of the Universal History, vol. xx. p.
196--250. A perpetual miracle is supposed to have guarded the prophecy
in favor of the posterity of Ishmael; and these learned bigots are not
afraid to risk the truth of Christianity on this frail and slippery
foundation. * Note: It certainly appears difficult to extract a
prediction of the perpetual independence of the Arabs from the text in
Genesis, which would have received an ample fulfilment during
centuries of uninvaded freedom. But the disputants appear to forget the
inseparable connection in the prediction between the wild, the Bedoween
habits of the Ismaelites, with their national independence. The
stationary and civilized descendant of Ismael forfeited, as it were, his
birthright, and ceased to be a genuine son of the "wild man" The
phrase, "dwelling in the presence of his brethren," is interpreted by
Rosenmuller (in loc.) and others, according to the Hebrew geography, "to
the East" of his brethren, the legitimate race of Abraham--M.]

[Footnote 4: D'Herbelot, Biblioth. Orient. p. 477. Pocock, Specimen
Hist. Arabum, p. 64, 65. Father Pagi (Critica, tom. ii. p. 646) has
proved that, after ten years' peace, the Persian war, which continued
twenty years, was renewed A.D. 571. Mahomet was born A.D. 569, in
the year of the elephant, or the defeat of Abrahah, (Gagnier, Vie de
Mahomet, tom. i. p. 89, 90, 98;) and this account allows two years for
the conquest of Yemen. * Note: Abrahah, according to some accounts, was
succeeded by his son Taksoum, who reigned seventeen years; his brother
Mascouh, who was slain in battle against the Persians, twelve. But this
chronology is irreconcilable with the Arabian conquests of Nushirvan the
Great. Either Seif, or his son Maadi Karb, was the native prince placed
on the throne by the Persians. St. Martin, vol. x. p. 78. See likewise
Johannsen, Hist. Yemanae.--M.]

[Footnote 411: Persarmenia was long maintained in peace by the tolerant
administration of Mejej, prince of the Gnounians. On his death he was
succeeded by a persecutor, a Persian, named Ten-Schahpour, who attempted
to propagate Zoroastrianism by violence. Nushirvan, on an appeal to
the throne by the Armenian clergy, replaced Ten-Schahpour, in 552, by
Veschnas-Vahram. The new marzban, or governor, was instructed to repress
the bigoted Magi in their persecutions of the Armenians, but the Persian
converts to Christianity were still exposed to cruel sufferings. The
most distinguished of them, Izdbouzid, was crucified at Dovin in the
presence of a vast multitude. The fame of this martyr spread to the
West. Menander, the historian, not only, as appears by a fragment
published by Mai, related this event in his history, but, according
to M. St. Martin, wrote a tragedy on the subject. This, however, is
an unwarrantable inference from the phrase which merely means that he
related the tragic event in his history. An epigram on the same subject,
preserved in the Anthology, Jacob's Anth. Palat. i. 27, belongs to
the historian. Yet Armenia remained in peace under the government of
Veschnas-Vahram and his successor Varazdat. The tyranny of his successor
Surena led to the insurrection under Vartan, the Mamigonian, who
revenged the death of his brother on the marzban Surena, surprised
Dovin, and put to the sword the governor, the soldiers, and the Magians.

[Footnote 6: In the history of the world I can only perceive two navies
on the Caspian: 1. Of the Macedonians, when Patrocles, the admiral of
the kings of Syria, Seleucus and Antiochus, descended most probably the
River Oxus, from the confines of India, (Plin. Hist. Natur. vi. 21.) 2.
Of the Russians, when Peter the First conducted a fleet and army from
the neighborhood of Moscow to the coast of Persia, (Bell's Travels, vol.
ii. p. 325--352.) He justly observes, that such martial pomp had never
been displayed on the Volga.]

The throne of Chosroes Nushirvan was filled by Hormouz, or Hormisdas,
the eldest or the most favored of his sons. With the kingdoms of Persia
and India, he inherited the reputation and example of his father, the
service, in every rank, of his wise and valiant officers, and a general
system of administration, harmonized by time and political wisdom to
promote the happiness of the prince and people. But the royal youth
enjoyed a still more valuable blessing, the friendship of a sage who had
presided over his education, and who always preferred the honor to the
interest of his pupil, his interest to his inclination. In a dispute
with the Greek and Indian philosophers, Buzurg [8] had once maintained,
that the most grievous misfortune of life is old age without the
remembrance of virtue; and our candor will presume that the same
principle compelled him, during three years, to direct the councils of
the Persian empire. His zeal was rewarded by the gratitude and docility
of Hormouz, who acknowledged himself more indebted to his preceptor than
to his parent: but when age and labor had impaired the strength, and
perhaps the faculties, of this prudent counsellor, he retired from
court, and abandoned the youthful monarch to his own passions and those
of his favorites. By the fatal vicissitude of human affairs, the same
scenes were renewed at Ctesiphon, which had been exhibited at Rome after
the death of Marcus Antoninus. The ministers of flattery and corruption,
who had been banished by his father, were recalled and cherished by
the son; the disgrace and exile of the friends of Nushirvan established
their tyranny; and virtue was driven by degrees from the mind of
Hormouz, from his palace, and from the government of the state. The
faithful agents, the eyes and ears of the king, informed him of the
progress of disorder, that the provincial governors flew to their prey
with the fierceness of lions and eagles, and that their rapine and
injustice would teach the most loyal of his subjects to abhor the name
and authority of their sovereign. The sincerity of this advice was
punished with death; the murmurs of the cities were despised, their
tumults were quelled by military execution: the intermediate powers
between the throne and the people were abolished; and the childish
vanity of Hormouz, who affected the daily use of the tiara, was fond of
declaring, that he alone would be the judge as well as the master of his
kingdom.

In every word, and in every action, the son of Nushirvan degenerated
from the virtues of his father. His avarice defrauded the troops; his
jealous caprice degraded the satraps; the palace, the tribunals, the
waters of the Tigris, were stained with the blood of the innocent, and
the tyrant exulted in the sufferings and execution of thirteen thousand
victims. As the excuse of his cruelty, he sometimes condescended to
observe, that the fears of the Persians would be productive of hatred,
and that their hatred must terminate in rebellion but he forgot that his
own guilt and folly had inspired the sentiments which he deplored, and
prepared the event which he so justly apprehended. Exasperated by long
and hopeless oppression, the provinces of Babylon, Susa, and Carmania,
erected the standard of revolt; and the princes of Arabia, India, and
Scythia, refused the customary tribute to the unworthy successor of
Nushirvan. The arms of the Romans, in slow sieges and frequent inroads,
afflicted the frontiers of Mesopotamia and Assyria: one of their
generals professed himself the disciple of Scipio; and the soldiers were
animated by a miraculous image of Christ, whose mild aspect should never
have been displayed in the front of battle. [9] At the same time, the
eastern provinces of Persia were invaded by the great khan, who passed
the Oxus at the head of three or four hundred thousand Turks. The
imprudent Hormouz accepted their perfidious and formidable aid; the
cities of Khorassan or Bactriana were commanded to open their gates the
march of the Barbarians towards the mountains of Hyrcania revealed the
correspondence of the Turkish and Roman arms; and their union must have
subverted the throne of the house of Sassan.

[Footnote 8: Buzurg Mihir may be considered, in his character and
station, as the Seneca of the East; but his virtues, and perhaps his
faults, are less known than those of the Roman, who appears to have been
much more loquacious. The Persian sage was the person who imported from
India the game of chess and the fables of Pilpay. Such has been the fame
of his wisdom and virtues, that the Christians claim him as a believer
in the gospel; and the Mahometans revere Buzurg as a premature
Mussulman. D'Herbelot, Bibliotheque Orientale, p. 218.]

[Footnote 9: See the imitation of Scipio in Theophylact, l. i. c. 14;
the image of Christ, l. ii. c. 3. Hereafter I shall speak more amply
of the Christian images--I had almost said idols. This, if I am not
mistaken, is the oldest of divine manufacture; but in the next thousand
years, many others issued from the same workshop.]

Persia had been lost by a king; it was saved by a hero. After his
revolt, Varanes or Bahram is stigmatized by the son of Hormouz as an
ungrateful slave; the proud and ambiguous reproach of despotism, since
he was truly descended from the ancient princes of Rei, [10] one of
the seven families whose splendid, as well as substantial, prerogatives
exalted them above the heads of the Persian nobility. [11] At the siege
of Dara, the valor of Bahram was signalized under the eyes of Nushirvan,
and both the father and son successively promoted him to the command of
armies, the government of Media, and the superintendence of the palace.
The popular prediction which marked him as the deliverer of Persia,
might be inspired by his past victories and extraordinary figure: the
epithet Giubin [1111] is expressive of the quality of dry wood: he had
the strength and stature of a giant; and his savage countenance was
fancifully compared to that of a wild cat. While the nation trembled,
while Hormouz disguised his terror by the name of suspicion, and his
servants concealed their disloyalty under the mask of fear, Bahram alone
displayed his undaunted courage and apparent fidelity: and as soon as
he found that no more than twelve thousand soldiers would follow him
against the enemy; he prudently declared, that to this fatal number
Heaven had reserved the honors of the triumph. [1112] The steep and
narrow descent of the Pule Rudbar, [12] or Hyrcanian rock, is the only
pass through which an army can penetrate into the territory of Rei and
the plains of Media. From the commanding heights, a band of resolute men
might overwhelm with stones and darts the myriads of the Turkish
host: their emperor and his son were transpierced with arrows; and the
fugitives were left, without counsel or provisions, to the revenge of an
injured people. The patriotism of the Persian general was stimulated by
his affection for the city of his forefathers: in the hour of victory,
every peasant became a soldier, and every soldier a hero; and their
ardor was kindled by the gorgeous spectacle of beds, and thrones, and
tables of massy gold, the spoils of Asia, and the luxury of the hostile
camp. A prince of a less malignant temper could not easily have forgiven
his benefactor; and the secret hatred of Hormouz was envenomed by a
malicious report, that Bahram had privately retained the most precious
fruits of his Turkish victory. But the approach of a Roman army on
the side of the Araxes compelled the implacable tyrant to smile and to
applaud; and the toils of Bahram were rewarded with the permission of
encountering a new enemy, by their skill and discipline more formidable
than a Scythian multitude. Elated by his recent success, he despatched
a herald with a bold defiance to the camp of the Romans, requesting them
to fix a day of battle, and to choose whether they would pass the river
themselves, or allow a free passage to the arms of the great king. The
lieutenant of the emperor Maurice preferred the safer alternative; and
this local circumstance, which would have enhanced the victory of
the Persians, rendered their defeat more bloody and their escape more
difficult. But the loss of his subjects, and the danger of his kingdom,
were overbalanced in the mind of Hormouz by the disgrace of his personal
enemy; and no sooner had Bahram collected and reviewed his forces, than
he received from a royal messenger the insulting gift of a distaff, a
spinning-wheel, and a complete suit of female apparel. Obedient to the
will of his sovereign he showed himself to the soldiers in this unworthy
disguise they resented his ignominy and their own; a shout of rebellion
ran through the ranks; and the general accepted their oath of fidelity
and vows of revenge. A second messenger, who had been commanded to bring
the rebel in chains, was trampled under the feet of an elephant, and
manifestos were diligently circulated, exhorting the Persians to assert
their freedom against an odious and contemptible tyrant. The defection
was rapid and universal; his loyal slaves were sacrificed to the public
fury; the troops deserted to the standard of Bahram; and the provinces
again saluted the deliverer of his country.

[Footnote 10: Ragae, or Rei, is mentioned in the Apocryphal book
of Tobit as already flourishing, 700 years before Christ, under the
Assyrian empire. Under the foreign names of Europus and Arsacia, this
city, 500 stadia to the south of the Caspian gates, was successively
embellished by the Macedonians and Parthians, (Strabo, l. xi. p. 796.)
Its grandeur and populousness in the ixth century are exaggerated beyond
the bounds of credibility; but Rei has been since ruined by wars and the
unwholesomeness of the air. Chardin, Voyage en Perse, tom. i. p. 279,
280. D'Herbelot, Biblioth. Oriental. p. 714.]

[Footnote 11: Theophylact. l. iii. c. 18. The story of the seven
Persians is told in the third book of Herodotus; and their noble
descendants are often mentioned, especially in the fragments of Ctesias.
Yet the independence of Otanes (Herodot. l. iii. c. 83, 84) is hostile
to the spirit of despotism, and it may not seem probable that the seven
families could survive the revolutions of eleven hundred years. They
might, however, be represented by the seven ministers, (Brisson, de
Regno Persico, l. i. p. 190;) and some Persian nobles, like the kings
of Pontus (Polyb l. v. p. 540) and Cappadocia, (Diodor. Sicul. l. xxxi.
tom. ii. p. 517,) might claim their descent from the bold companions of
Darius.]

[Footnote 1111: He is generally called Baharam Choubeen, Baharam, the
stick-like, probably from his appearance. Malcolm, vol. i. p. 120.--M.]

[Footnote 1112: The Persian historians say, that Hormouz entreated his
general to increase his numbers; but Baharam replied, that experience
had taught him that it was the quality, not the number of soldiers,
which gave success. * * * No man in his army was under forty years, and
none above fifty. Malcolm, vol. i. p. 121--M.]

[Footnote 12: See an accurate description of this mountain by Olearius,
(Voyage en Perse, p. 997, 998,) who ascended it with much difficulty and
danger in his return from Ispahan to the Caspian Sea.]

As the passes were faithfully guarded, Hormouz could only compute the
number of his enemies by the testimony of a guilty conscience, and the
daily defection of those who, in the hour of his distress, avenged their
wrongs, or forgot their obligations. He proudly displayed the ensigns of
royalty; but the city and palace of Modain had already escaped from
the hand of the tyrant. Among the victims of his cruelty, Bindoes, a
Sassanian prince, had been cast into a dungeon; his fetters were broken
by the zeal and courage of a brother; and he stood before the king at
the head of those trusty guards, who had been chosen as the ministers
of his confinement, and perhaps of his death. Alarmed by the hasty
intrusion and bold reproaches of the captive, Hormouz looked round,
but in vain, for advice or assistance; discovered that his strength
consisted in the obedience of others; and patiently yielded to the
single arm of Bindoes, who dragged him from the throne to the same
dungeon in which he himself had been so lately confined. At the first
tumult, Chosroes, the eldest of the sons of Hormouz, escaped from the
city; he was persuaded to return by the pressing and friendly invitation
of Bindoes, who promised to seat him on his father's throne, and who
expected to reign under the name of an inexperienced youth. In the just
assurance, that his accomplices could neither forgive nor hope to be
forgiven, and that every Persian might be trusted as the judge and enemy
of the tyrant, he instituted a public trial without a precedent and
without a copy in the annals of the East. The son of Nushirvan, who had
requested to plead in his own defence, was introduced as a criminal
into the full assembly of the nobles and satraps. [13] He was heard with
decent attention as long as he expatiated on the advantages of order and
obedience, the danger of innovation, and the inevitable discord of those
who had encouraged each other to trample on their lawful and hereditary
sovereign. By a pathetic appeal to their humanity, he extorted that pity
which is seldom refused to the fallen fortunes of a king; and while they
beheld the abject posture and squalid appearance of the prisoner,
his tears, his chains, and the marks of ignominious stripes, it was
impossible to forget how recently they had adored the divine splendor of
his diadem and purple. But an angry murmur arose in the assembly as soon
as he presumed to vindicate his conduct, and to applaud the victories
of his reign. He defined the duties of a king, and the Persian nobles
listened with a smile of contempt; they were fired with indignation
when he dared to vilify the character of Chosroes; and by the indiscreet
offer of resigning the sceptre to the second of his sons, he subscribed
his own condemnation, and sacrificed the life of his own innocent
favorite. The mangled bodies of the boy and his mother were exposed to
the people; the eyes of Hormouz were pierced with a hot needle; and the
punishment of the father was succeeded by the coronation of his eldest
son. Chosroes had ascended the throne without guilt, and his piety
strove to alleviate the misery of the abdicated monarch; from the
dungeon he removed Hormouz to an apartment of the palace, supplied with
liberality the consolations of sensual enjoyment, and patiently endured
the furious sallies of his resentment and despair. He might despise the
resentment of a blind and unpopular tyrant, but the tiara was trembling
on his head, till he could subvert the power, or acquire the friendship,
of the great Bahram, who sternly denied the justice of a revolution, in
which himself and his soldiers, the true representatives of Persia, had
never been consulted. The offer of a general amnesty, and of the second
rank in his kingdom, was answered by an epistle from Bahram, friend of
the gods, conqueror of men, and enemy of tyrants, the satrap of satraps,
general of the Persian armies, and a prince adorned with the title of
eleven virtues. [14] He commands Chosroes, the son of Hormouz, to shun
the example and fate of his father, to confine the traitors who had been
released from their chains, to deposit in some holy place the diadem
which he had usurped, and to accept from his gracious benefactor the
pardon of his faults and the government of a province. The rebel might
not be proud, and the king most assuredly was not humble; but the one
was conscious of his strength, the other was sensible of his weakness;
and even the modest language of his reply still left room for treaty and
reconciliation. Chosroes led into the field the slaves of the palace and
the populace of the capital: they beheld with terror the banners of a
veteran army; they were encompassed and surprised by the evolutions
of the general; and the satraps who had deposed Hormouz, received the
punishment of their revolt, or expiated their first treason by a second
and more criminal act of disloyalty. The life and liberty of Chosroes
were saved, but he was reduced to the necessity of imploring aid or
refuge in some foreign land; and the implacable Bindoes, anxious to
secure an unquestionable title, hastily returned to the palace, and
ended, with a bowstring, the wretched existence of the son of Nushirvan.
[15]

[Footnote 13: The Orientals suppose that Bahram convened this assembly
and proclaimed Chosroes; but Theophylact is, in this instance, more
distinct and credible. * Note: Yet Theophylact seems to have seized
the opportunity to indulge his propensity for writing orations; and the
orations read rather like those of a Grecian sophist than of an Eastern
assembly.--M.]

[Footnote 14: See the words of Theophylact, l. iv. c. 7., &c. In answer,
Chosroes styles himself in genuine Oriental bombast.]

[Footnote 15: Theophylact (l. iv. c. 7) imputes the death of Hormouz
to his son, by whose command he was beaten to death with clubs. I have
followed the milder account of Khondemir and Eutychius, and shall
always be content with the slightest evidence to extenuate the crime
of parricide. Note: Malcolm concurs in ascribing his death to Bundawee,
(Bindoes,) vol. i. p. 123. The Eastern writers generally impute the
crime to the uncle St. Martin, vol. x. p. 300.--M.]

While Chosroes despatched the preparations of his retreat, he
deliberated with his remaining friends, [16] whether he should lurk
in the valleys of Mount Caucasus, or fly to the tents of the Turks,
or solicit the protection of the emperor. The long emulation of the
successors of Artaxerxes and Constantine increased his reluctance to
appear as a suppliant in a rival court; but he weighed the forces of the
Romans, and prudently considered that the neighborhood of Syria would
render his escape more easy and their succors more effectual. Attended
only by his concubines, and a troop of thirty guards, he secretly
departed from the capital, followed the banks of the Euphrates,
traversed the desert, and halted at the distance of ten miles from
Circesium. About the third watch of the night, the Roman praefect was
informed of his approach, and he introduced the royal stranger to
the fortress at the dawn of day. From thence the king of Persia was
conducted to the more honorable residence of Hierapolis; and Maurice
dissembled his pride, and displayed his benevolence, at the reception
of the letters and ambassadors of the grandson of Nushirvan. They humbly
represented the vicissitudes of fortune and the common interest of
princes, exaggerated the ingratitude of Bahram, the agent of the evil
principle, and urged, with specious argument, that it was for the
advantage of the Romans themselves to support the two monarchies which
balance the world, the two great luminaries by whose salutary influence
it is vivified and adorned. The anxiety of Chosroes was soon relieved
by the assurance, that the emperor had espoused the cause of justice
and royalty; but Maurice prudently declined the expense and delay of his
useless visit to Constantinople. In the name of his generous benefactor,
a rich diadem was presented to the fugitive prince, with an inestimable
gift of jewels and gold; a powerful army was assembled on the frontiers
of Syria and Armenia, under the command of the valiant and faithful
Narses, [17] and this general, of his own nation, and his own choice,
was directed to pass the Tigris, and never to sheathe his sword till
he had restored Chosroes to the throne of his ancestors. [1711] The
enterprise, however splendid, was less arduous than it might appear.
Persia had already repented of her fatal rashness, which betrayed the
heir of the house of Sassan to the ambition of a rebellious subject:
and the bold refusal of the Magi to consecrate his usurpation, compelled
Bahram to assume the sceptre, regardless of the laws and prejudices of
the nation. The palace was soon distracted with conspiracy, the city
with tumult, the provinces with insurrection; and the cruel execution of
the guilty and the suspected served to irritate rather than subdue the
public discontent. No sooner did the grandson of Nushirvan display his
own and the Roman banners beyond the Tigris, than he was joined, each
day, by the increasing multitudes of the nobility and people; and as he
advanced, he received from every side the grateful offerings of the keys
of his cities and the heads of his enemies. As soon as Modain was freed
from the presence of the usurper, the loyal inhabitants obeyed the first
summons of Mebodes at the head of only two thousand horse, and Chosroes
accepted the sacred and precious ornaments of the palace as the pledge
of their truth and the presage of his approaching success. After the
junction of the Imperial troops, which Bahram vainly struggled to
prevent, the contest was decided by two battles on the banks of the Zab,
and the confines of Media. The Romans, with the faithful subjects of
Persia, amounted to sixty thousand, while the whole force of the usurper
did not exceed forty thousand men: the two generals signalized their
valor and ability; but the victory was finally determined by the
prevalence of numbers and discipline. With the remnant of a broken army,
Bahram fled towards the eastern provinces of the Oxus: the enmity of
Persia reconciled him to the Turks; but his days were shortened by
poison, perhaps the most incurable of poisons; the stings of remorse
and despair, and the bitter remembrance of lost glory. Yet the modern
Persians still commemorate the exploits of Bahram; and some excellent
laws have prolonged the duration of his troubled and transitory reign.

[Footnote 16: After the battle of Pharsalia, the Pompey of Lucan (l.
viii. 256--455) holds a similar debate. He was himself desirous of
seeking the Parthians: but his companions abhorred the unnatural
alliance and the adverse prejudices might operate as forcibly on
Chosroes and his companions, who could describe, with the same
vehemence, the contrast of laws, religion, and manners, between the East
and West.]

[Footnote 17: In this age there were three warriors of the name of
Narses, who have been often confounded, (Pagi, Critica, tom. ii. p.
640:) 1. A Persarmenian, the brother of Isaac and Armatius, who, after
a successful action against Belisarius, deserted from his Persian
sovereign, and afterwards served in the Italian war.--2. The eunuch who
conquered Italy.--3. The restorer of Chosroes, who is celebrated in
the poem of Corippus (l. iii. 220--327) as excelsus super omnia
vertico agmina.... habitu modestus.... morum probitate placens, virtute
verendus; fulmineus, cautus, vigilans, &c.]

[Footnote 1711: The Armenians adhered to Chosroes. St. Martin, vol. x.
p. 312.--M.]

[Footnote 1712: According to Mivkhond and the Oriental writers, Bahram
received the daughter of the Khakan in marriage, and commanded a body
of Turks in an invasion of Persia. Some say that he was assassinated;
Malcolm adopts the opinion that he was poisoned. His sister Gourdieh,
the companion of his flight, is celebrated in the Shah Nameh. She
was afterwards one of the wives of Chosroes. St. Martin. vol. x. p.
331.--M.]

The restoration of Chosroes was celebrated with feasts and executions;
and the music of the royal banquet was often disturbed by the groans
of dying or mutilated criminals. A general pardon might have diffused
comfort and tranquillity through a country which had been shaken by
the late revolutions; yet, before the sanguinary temper of Chosroes is
blamed, we should learn whether the Persians had not been accustomed
either to dread the rigor, or to despise the weakness, of their
sovereign. The revolt of Bahram, and the conspiracy of the satraps, were
impartially punished by the revenge or justice of the conqueror; the
merits of Bindoes himself could not purify his hand from the guilt
of royal blood: and the son of Hormouz was desirous to assert his own
innocence, and to vindicate the sanctity of kings. During the vigor of
the Roman power, several princes were seated on the throne of Persia by
the arms and the authority of the first Caesars. But their new subjects
were soon disgusted with the vices or virtues which they had imbibed in
a foreign land; the instability of their dominion gave birth to a vulgar
observation, that the choice of Rome was solicited and rejected with
equal ardor by the capricious levity of Oriental slaves. But the glory
of Maurice was conspicuous in the long and fortunate reign of his son
and his ally. A band of a thousand Romans, who continued to guard the
person of Chosroes, proclaimed his confidence in the fidelity of the
strangers; his growing strength enabled him to dismiss this unpopular
aid, but he steadily professed the same gratitude and reverence to his
adopted father; and till the death of Maurice, the peace and alliance
of the two empires were faithfully maintained. [18] Yet the mercenary
friendship of the Roman prince had been purchased with costly and
important gifts; the strong cities of Martyropolis and Dara [1811]
were restored, and the Persarmenians became the willing subjects of an
empire, whose eastern limit was extended, beyond the example of former
times, as far as the banks of the Araxes, and the neighborhood of the
Caspian. A pious hope was indulged, that the church as well as the state
might triumph in this revolution: but if Chosroes had sincerely listened
to the Christian bishops, the impression was erased by the zeal and
eloquence of the Magi: if he was armed with philosophic indifference,
he accommodated his belief, or rather his professions, to the various
circumstances of an exile and a sovereign. The imaginary conversion of
the king of Persia was reduced to a local and superstitious veneration
for Sergius, [19] one of the saints of Antioch, who heard his prayers
and appeared to him in dreams; he enriched the shrine with offerings of
gold and silver, and ascribed to this invisible patron the success of
his arms, and the pregnancy of Sira, a devout Christian and the best
beloved of his wives. [20] The beauty of Sira, or Schirin, [21] her wit,
her musical talents, are still famous in the history, or rather in
the romances, of the East: her own name is expressive, in the Persian
tongue, of sweetness and grace; and the epithet of Parviz alludes to the
charms of her royal lover. Yet Sira never shared the passions which she
inspired, and the bliss of Chosroes was tortured by a jealous doubt,
that while he possessed her person, she had bestowed her affections on a
meaner favorite. [22]

[Footnote 18: Experimentis cognitum est Barbaros malle Roma petere
reges quam habere. These experiments are admirably represented in the
invitation and expulsion of Vonones, (Annal. ii. 1--3,) Tiridates,
(Annal. vi. 32-44,) and Meherdates, (Annal. xi. 10, xii. 10-14.) The eye
of Tacitus seems to have transpierced the camp of the Parthians and the
walls of the harem.]

authorities, vol. x p. 332, and Memoires sur l'Armenie, tom. i. p.

[Footnote 19: Sergius and his companion Bacchus, who are said to have
suffered in the persecution of Maximian, obtained divine honor in
France, Italy, Constantinople, and the East. Their tomb at Rasaphe was
famous for miracles, and that Syrian town acquired the more honorable
name of Sergiopolis. Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom. v. p. 481--496.

[Footnote 20: Evagrius (l. vi. c. 21) and Theophylact (l. v. c. 13,
14) have preserved the original letters of Chosroes, written in Greek,
signed with his own hand, and afterwards inscribed on crosses and tables
of gold, which were deposited in the church of Sergiopolis. They had
been sent to the bishop of Antioch, as primate of Syria. * Note:
St. Martin thinks that they were first written in Syriac, and then
translated into the bad Greek in which they appear, vol. x. p. 334.--M.]

[Footnote 21: The Greeks only describe her as a Roman by birth, a
Christian by religion: but she is represented as the daughter of the
emperor Maurice in the Persian and Turkish romances which celebrate the
love of Khosrou for Schirin, of Schirin for Ferhad, the most beautiful
youth of the East, D'Herbelot, Biblioth. Orient. p. 789, 997, 998. *
Note: Compare M. von Hammer's preface to, and poem of, Schirin in
which he gives an account of the various Persian poems, of which he has
endeavored to extract the essence in his own work.--M.]

[Footnote 22: The whole series of the tyranny of Hormouz, the revolt of
Bahram, and the flight and restoration of Chosroes, is related by two
contemporary Greeks--more concisely by Evagrius, (l. vi. c. 16, 17, 18,
19,) and most diffusely by Theophylact Simocatta, (l. iii. c. 6--18,
l. iv. c. 1--16, l. v. c. 1-15:) succeeding compilers, Zonaras and
Cedrenus, can only transcribe and abridge. The Christian Arabs,
Eutychius (Annal. tom. ii. p. 200--208) and Abulpharagius (Dynast. p.
96--98) appear to have consulted some particular memoirs. The great
Persian historians of the xvth century, Mirkhond and Khondemir, are
only known to me by the imperfect extracts of Schikard, (Tarikh, p.
150--155,) Texeira, or rather Stevens, (Hist. of Persia, p. 182--186,)
a Turkish Ms. translated by the Abbe Fourmount, (Hist. de l'Academie des
Inscriptions, tom. vii. p. 325--334,) and D'Herbelot, (aux mots Hormouz,
p. 457--459. Bahram, p. 174. Khosrou Parviz, p. 996.) Were I perfectly
satisfied of their authority, I could wish these Oriental materials had
been more copious.]
