Note: In the notes to this important chapter, which is received as
the text-book on Civil Law in some of the foreign universities, I have
consulted,

I. the newly-discovered Institutes of Gaius, (Gaii Institutiones, ed.
Goeschen, Berlin, 1824,) with some other fragments of the Roman law,
(Codicis Theodosiani Fragmenta inedita, ab Amadeo Peyron. Turin, 1824.)

II. The History of the Roman Law, by Professor Hugo, in the French
translation of M. Jourdan. Paris, 1825.

III. Savigny, Geschichte des Romischen Rechts im Mittelalter, 6 bande,
Heidelberg, 1815.

IV. Walther, Romische Rechts-Geschichte, Bonn. 1834. But I am
particularly indebted to an edition of the French translation of this
chapter, with additional notes, by one of the most learned civilians of
Europe, Professor Warnkonig, published at Liege, 1821. I have inserted
almost the whole of these notes, which are distinguished by the letter
W.--M. The vain titles of the victories of Justinian are crumbled
into dust; but the name of the legislator is inscribed on a fair and
everlasting monument. Under his reign, and by his care, the civil
jurisprudence was digested in the immortal works of the Code, the
Pandects, and the Institutes: [1] the public reason of the Romans has
been silently or studiously transfused into the domestic institutions
of Europe, [2], and the laws of Justinian still command the respect or
obedience of independent nations. Wise or fortunate is the prince who
connects his own reputation with the honor or interest of a perpetual
order of men. The defence of their founder is the first cause, which
in every age has exercised the zeal and industry of the civilians. They
piously commemorate his virtues; dissemble or deny his failings; and
fiercely chastise the guilt or folly of the rebels, who presume to sully
the majesty of the purple. The idolatry of love has provoked, as it
usually happens, the rancor of opposition; the character of Justinian
has been exposed to the blind vehemence of flattery and invective; and
the injustice of a sect (the Anti-Tribonians,) has refused all praise
and merit to the prince, his ministers, and his laws. [3] Attached to no
party, interested only for the truth and candor of history, and
directed by the most temperate and skilful guides, [4] I enter with
just diffidence on the subject of civil law, which has exhausted so many
learned lives, and clothed the walls of such spacious libraries. In
a single, if possible in a short, chapter, I shall trace the Roman
jurisprudence from Romulus to Justinian, [5] appreciate the labors of
that emperor, and pause to contemplate the principles of a science so
important to the peace and happiness of society. The laws of a nation
form the most instructive portion of its history; and although I have
devoted myself to write the annals of a declining monarchy, I shall
embrace the occasion to breathe the pure and invigorating air of the
republic.

[Footnote 1: The civilians of the darker ages have established an absurd
and incomprehensible mode of quotation, which is supported by authority
and custom. In their references to the Code, the Pandects, and the
Institutes, they mention the number, not of the book, but only of the
law; and content themselves with reciting the first words of the title
to which it belongs; and of these titles there are more than a thousand.
Ludewig (Vit. Justiniani, p. 268) wishes to shake off this pendantic
yoke; and I have dared to adopt the simple and rational method of
numbering the book, the title, and the law. Note: The example of Gibbon
has been followed by M Hugo and other civilians.--M]

[Footnote 2: Germany, Bohemia, Hungary, Poland, and Scotland, have
received them as common law or reason; in France, Italy, &c., they
possess a direct or indirect influence; and they were respected in
England, from Stephen to Edward I. our national Justinian, (Duck. de
Usu et Auctoritate Juris Civilis, l. ii. c. 1, 8--15. Heineccius, Hist.
Juris Germanici, c. 3, 4, No. 55-124, and the legal historians of each
country.) * Note: Although the restoration of the Roman law, introduced
by the revival of this study in Italy, is one of the most important
branches of history, it had been treated but imperfectly when Gibbon
wrote his work. That of Arthur Duck is but an insignificant performance.
But the researches of the learned have thrown much light upon the
matter. The Sarti, the Tiraboschi, the Fantuzzi, the Savioli, had made
some very interesting inquiries; but it was reserved for M. de Savigny,
in a work entitled "The History of the Roman Law during the Middle
Ages," to cast the strongest right on this part of history. He
demonstrates incontestably the preservation of the Roman law from
Justinian to the time of the Glossators, who by their indefatigable
zeal, propagated the study of the Roman jurisprudence in all the
countries of Europe. It is much to be desired that the author should
continue this interesting work, and that the learned should engage in
the inquiry in what manner the Roman law introduced itself into their
respective countries, and the authority which it progressively acquired.
For Belgium, there exists, on this subject, (proposed by the Academy of
Brussels in 1781,) a Collection of Memoirs, printed at Brussels in
4to., 1783, among which should be distinguished those of M. de Berg. M.
Berriat Saint Prix has given us hopes of the speedy appearance of a
work in which he will discuss this question, especially in relation to
France. M. Spangenberg, in his Introduction to the Study of the Corpus
Juris Civilis Hanover, 1817, 1 vol. 8vo. p. 86, 116, gives us a general
sketch of the history of the Roman law in different parts of Europe.
We cannot avoid mentioning an elementary work by M. Hugo, in which he
treats of the History of the Roman Law from Justinian to the present
Time, 2d edit. Berlin 1818 W.]

[Footnote 3: Francis Hottoman, a learned and acute lawyer of the xvith
century, wished to mortify Cujacius, and to please the Chancellor
de l'Hopital. His Anti-Tribonianus (which I have never been able to
procure) was published in French in 1609; and his sect was propagated in
Germany, (Heineccius, Op. tom. iii. sylloge iii. p. 171--183.) * Note:
Though there have always been many detractors of the Roman law, no sect
of Anti-Tribonians has ever existed under that name, as Gibbon seems to
suppose.--W.]

[Footnote 4: At the head of these guides I shall respectfully place
the learned and perspicuous Heineccius, a German professor, who died
at Halle in the year 1741, (see his Eloge in the Nouvelle Bibliotheque
Germanique, tom. ii. p. 51--64.) His ample works have been collected
in eight volumes in 4to. Geneva, 1743-1748. The treatises which I have
separately used are, 1. Historia Juris Romani et Germanici, Lugd.
Batav. 1740, in 8 vo. 2. Syntagma Antiquitatum Romanam Jurisprudentiam
illustrantium, 2 vols. in 8 vo. Traject. ad Rhenum. 3. Elementa Juris
Civilis secundum Ordinem Institutionum, Lugd. Bat. 1751, in 8 vo. 4.
Elementa J. C. secundum Ordinem Pandectarum Traject. 1772, in 8vo. 2
vols. * Note: Our author, who was not a lawyer, was necessarily obliged
to content himself with following the opinions of those writers who were
then of the greatest authority; but as Heineccius, notwithstanding his
high reputation for the study of the Roman law, knew nothing of
the subject on which he treated, but what he had learned from the
compilations of various authors, it happened that, in following the
sometimes rash opinions of these guides, Gibbon has fallen into many
errors, which we shall endeavor in succession to correct. The work of
Bach on the History of the Roman Jurisprudence, with which Gibbon was
not acquainted, is far superior to that of Heineccius and since that
time we have new obligations to the modern historic civilians, whose
indefatigable researches have greatly enlarged the sphere of our
knowledge in this important branch of history. We want a pen like that
of Gibbon to give to the more accurate notions which we have acquired
since his time, the brilliancy, the vigor, and the animation
which Gibbon has bestowed on the opinions of Heineccius and his
contemporaries.--W]

[Footnote 5: Our original text is a fragment de Origine Juris (Pandect.
l. i. tit. ii.) of Pomponius, a Roman lawyer, who lived under the
Antonines, (Heinecc. tom. iii. syl. iii. p. 66--126.) It has been
abridged, and probably corrupted, by Tribonian, and since restored by
Bynkershoek (Opp. tom. i. p. 279--304.)]

The primitive government of Rome [6] was composed, with some political
skill, of an elective king, a council of nobles, and a general assembly
of the people. War and religion were administered by the supreme
magistrate; and he alone proposed the laws, which were debated in the
senate, and finally ratified or rejected by a majority of votes in
the thirty curiae or parishes of the city. Romulus, Numa, and Servius
Tullius, are celebrated as the most ancient legislators; and each
of them claims his peculiar part in the threefold division of
jurisprudence. [7] The laws of marriage, the education of children,
and the authority of parents, which may seem to draw their origin from
nature itself, are ascribed to the untutored wisdom of Romulus. The law
of nations and of religious worship, which Numa introduced, was derived
from his nocturnal converse with the nymph Egeria. The civil law is
attributed to the experience of Servius: he balanced the rights and
fortunes of the seven classes of citizens; and guarded, by fifty new
regulations, the observance of contracts and the punishment of crimes.
The state, which he had inclined towards a democracy, was changed by the
last Tarquin into a lawless despotism; and when the kingly office was
abolished, the patricians engrossed the benefits of freedom. The royal
laws became odious or obsolete; the mysterious deposit was silently
preserved by the priests and nobles; and at the end of sixty years, the
citizens of Rome still complained that they were ruled by the arbitrary
sentence of the magistrates. Yet the positive institutions of the kings
had blended themselves with the public and private manners of the city,
some fragments of that venerable jurisprudence [8] were compiled by the
diligence of antiquarians, [9] and above twenty texts still speak the
rudeness of the Pelasgic idiom of the Latins. [10]

[Footnote 6: The constitutional history of the kings of Rome may be
studied in the first book of Livy, and more copiously in Dionysius
Halicarnassensis, (l. li. p. 80--96, 119--130, l. iv. p. 198--220,) who
sometimes betrays the character of a rhetorician and a Greek. * Note: M.
Warnkonig refers to the work of Beaufort, on the Uncertainty of the
Five First Ages of the Roman History, with which Gibbon was probably
acquainted, to Niebuhr, and to the less known volume of Wachsmuth,
"Aeltere Geschichte des Rom. Staats." To these I would add A. W.
Schlegel's Review of Niebuhr, and my friend Dr. Arnold's recently
published volume, of which the chapter on the Law of the XII. Tables
appears to me one of the most valuable, if not the most valuable,
chapter.--M.]

[Footnote 7: This threefold division of the law was applied to the three
Roman kings by Justus Lipsius, (Opp. tom. iv. p. 279;) is adopted by
Gravina, (Origines Juris Civilis, p. 28, edit. Lips. 1737:) and is
reluctantly admitted by Mascou, his German editor. * Note: Whoever is
acquainted with the real notions of the Romans on the jus naturale,
gentium et civile, cannot but disapprove of this explanation which
has no relation to them, and might be taken for a pleasantry. It is
certainly unnecessary to increase the confusion which already prevails
among modern writers on the true sense of these ideas. Hugo.--W]

[Footnote 8: The most ancient Code or Digest was styled Jus Papirianum,
from the first compiler, Papirius, who flourished somewhat before
or after the Regifugium, (Pandect. l. i. tit. ii.) The best judicial
critics, even Bynkershoek (tom. i. p. 284, 285) and Heineccius, (Hist.
J. C. R. l. i. c. 16, 17, and Opp. tom. iii. sylloge iv. p. 1--8,) give
credit to this tale of Pomponius, without sufficiently adverting to
the value and rarity of such a monument of the third century, of the
illiterate city. I much suspect that the Caius Papirius, the Pontifex
Maximus, who revived the laws of Numa (Dionys. Hal. l. iii. p. 171) left
only an oral tradition; and that the Jus Papirianum of Granius Flaccus
(Pandect. l. L. tit. xvi. leg. 144) was not a commentary, but an
original work, compiled in the time of Caesar, (Censorin. de Die
Natali, l. iii. p. 13, Duker de Latinitate J. C. p. 154.) Note: Niebuhr
considers the Jus Papirianum, adduced by Verrius Fiaccus, to be of
undoubted authenticity. Rom. Geschichte, l. 257.--M. Compare this with
the work of M. Hugo.--W.]

[Footnote 9: A pompous, though feeble attempt to restore the original,
is made in the Histoire de la Jurisprudence Romaine of Terasson, p.
22--72, Paris, 1750, in folio; a work of more promise than performance.]

[Footnote 10: In the year 1444, seven or eight tables of brass were dug
up between Cortona and Gubio. A part of these (for the rest is Etruscan)
represents the primitive state of the Pelasgic letters and language,
which are ascribed by Herodotus to that district of Italy, (l. i. c. 56,
57, 58;) though this difficult passage may be explained of a Crestona in
Thrace, (Notes de Larcher, tom. i. p. 256--261.) The savage dialect
of the Eugubine tables  has exercised, and may still elude, the
divination of criticism; but the root is undoubtedly Latin, of the same
age and character as the Saliare Carmen, which, in the time of Horace,
none could understand. The Roman idiom, by an infusion of Doric and
Aeolic Greek, was gradually ripened into the style of the xii. tables,
of the Duillian column, of Ennius, of Terence, and of Cicero, (Gruter.
Inscript. tom. i. p. cxlii. Scipion Maffei, Istoria Diplomatica, p.
241--258. Bibliotheque Italique, tom. iii. p. 30--41, 174--205. tom.
xiv. p. 1--52.) * Note: The Eugubine Tables have exercised the ingenuity
of the Italian and German critics; it seems admitted (O. Muller,
die Etrusker, ii. 313) that they are Tuscan. See the works of Lanzi,
Passeri, Dempster, and O. Muller.--M]

I shall not repeat the well-known story of the Decemvirs, [11] who
sullied by their actions the honor of inscribing on brass, or wood, or
ivory, the Twelve Tables of the Roman laws. [12] They were dictated by
the rigid and jealous spirit of an aristocracy, which had yielded with
reluctance to the just demands of the people. But the substance of the
Twelve Tables was adapted to the state of the city; and the Romans
had emerged from Barbarism, since they were capable of studying and
embracing the institutions of their more enlightened neighbors. [1211]
A wise Ephesian was driven by envy from his native country: before he
could reach the shores of Latium, he had observed the various forms
of human nature and civil society: he imparted his knowledge to the
legislators of Rome, and a statue was erected in the forum to the
perpetual memory of Hermodorus. [13] The names and divisions of the
copper money, the sole coin of the infant state, were of Dorian origin:
[14] the harvests of Campania and Sicily relieved the wants of a people
whose agriculture was often interrupted by war and faction; and since
the trade was established, [15] the deputies who sailed from the
Tyber might return from the same harbors with a more precious cargo
of political wisdom. The colonies of Great Greece had transported and
improved the arts of their mother country. Cumae and Rhegium, Crotona
and Tarentum, Agrigentum and Syracuse, were in the rank of the most
flourishing cities. The disciples of Pythagoras applied philosophy to
the use of government; the unwritten laws of Charondas accepted the
aid of poetry and music, [16] and Zaleucus framed the republic of the
Locrians, which stood without alteration above two hundred years. [17]
From a similar motive of national pride, both Livy and Dionysius are
willing to believe, that the deputies of Rome visited Athens under the
wise and splendid administration of Pericles; and the laws of Solon were
transfused into the twelve tables. If such an embassy had indeed been
received from the Barbarians of Hesperia, the Roman name would have
been familiar to the Greeks before the reign of Alexander; [18] and
the faintest evidence would have been explored and celebrated by the
curiosity of succeeding times. But the Athenian monuments are silent;
nor will it seem credible that the patricians should undertake a long
and perilous navigation to copy the purest model of democracy. In the
comparison of the tables of Solon with those of the Decemvirs, some
casual resemblance may be found; some rules which nature and reason have
revealed to every society; some proofs of a common descent from Egypt
or Phoenicia. [19] But in all the great lines of public and private
jurisprudence, the legislators of Rome and Athens appear to be strangers
or adverse at each other.

[Footnote 11: Compare Livy (l. iii. c. 31--59) with Dionysius
Halicarnassensis, (l. x. p. 644--xi. p. 691.) How concise and animated
is the Roman--how prolix and lifeless the Greek! Yet he has admirably
judged the masters, and defined the rules, of historical composition.]

[Footnote 12: From the historians, Heineccius (Hist. J. R. l. i. No. 26)
maintains that the twelve tables were of brass--aereas; in the text of
Pomponius we read eboreas; for which Scaliger has substituted roboreas,
(Bynkershoek, p. 286.) Wood, brass, and ivory, might be successively
employed. Note: Compare Niebuhr, vol. ii. p. 349, &c.--M.]

[Footnote 1211: Compare Niebuhr, 355, note 720.--M. It is a most
important question whether the twelve tables in fact include laws
imported from Greece. The negative opinion maintained by our author, is
now almost universally adopted, particularly by Mm. Niebuhr, Hugo, and
others. See my Institutiones Juris Romani privati Leodii, 1819, p. 311,
312.--W. Dr. Arnold, p. 255, seems to incline to the opposite opinion.
Compare some just and sensible observations in the Appendix to Mr.
Travers Twiss's Epitome of Niebuhr, p. 347, Oxford, 1836.--M.]

[Footnote 13: His exile is mentioned by Cicero, (Tusculan. Quaestion. v.
36; his statue by Pliny, (Hist. Nat. xxxiv. 11.) The letter, dream, and
prophecy of Heraclitus, are alike spurious, (Epistolae Graec. Divers. p.
337.) * Note: Compare Niebuhr, ii. 209.--M. See the Mem de l'Academ. des
Inscript. xxii. p. 48. It would be difficult to disprove, that a certain
Hermodorus had some share in framing the Laws of the Twelve Tables.
Pomponius even says that this Hermodorus was the author of the last two
tables. Pliny calls him the Interpreter of the Decemvirs, which may lead
us to suppose that he labored with them in drawing up that law. But
it is astonishing that in his Dissertation, (De Hermodoro vero XII.
Tabularum Auctore, Annales Academiae Groninganae anni 1817, 1818,) M.
Gratama has ventured to advance two propositions entirely devoid of
proof: "Decem priores tabulas ab ipsis Romanis non esse profectas, tota
confirma Decemviratus Historia," et "Hermodorum legum decemviralium ceri
nominis auctorem esse, qui eas composuerit suis ordinibus, disposuerit,
suaque fecerit auctoritate, ut a decemviris reciperentur." This truly
was an age in which the Roman Patricians would allow their laws to be
dictated by a foreign Exile! Mr. Gratama does not attempt to prove the
authenticity of the supposititious letter of Heraclitus. He contents
himself with expressing his astonishment that M. Bonamy (as well as
Gibbon) will be receive it as genuine.--W.]

[Footnote 14: This intricate subject of the Sicilian and Roman money,
is ably discussed by Dr. Bentley, (Dissertation on the Epistles of
Phalaris, p. 427--479,) whose powers in this controversy were called
forth by honor and resentment.]

[Footnote 15: The Romans, or their allies, sailed as far as the fair
promontory of Africa, (Polyb. l. iii. p. 177, edit. Casaubon, in folio.)
Their voyages to Cumae, &c., are noticed by Livy and Dionysius.]

[Footnote 16: This circumstance would alone prove the antiquity of
Charondas, the legislator of Rhegium and Catana, who, by a strange error
of Diodorus Siculus (tom. i. l. xii. p. 485--492) is celebrated long
afterwards as the author of the policy of Thurium.]

[Footnote 17: Zaleucus, whose existence has been rashly attacked, had
the merit and glory of converting a band of outlaws (the Locrians) into
the most virtuous and orderly of the Greek republics. (See two Memoirs
of the Baron de St. Croix, sur la Legislation de la Grande Grece Mem.
de l'Academie, tom. xlii. p. 276--333.) But the laws of Zaleucus and
Charondas, which imposed on Diodorus and Stobaeus, are the spurious
composition of a Pythagorean sophist, whose fraud has been detected by
the critical sagacity of Bentley, p. 335--377.]

[Footnote 18: I seize the opportunity of tracing the progress of this
national intercourse 1. Herodotus and Thucydides (A. U. C. 300--350)
appear ignorant of the name and existence of Rome, (Joseph. contra
Appion tom. ii. l. i. c. 12, p. 444, edit. Havercamp.) 2. Theopompus (A.
U. C. 400, Plin. iii. 9) mentions the invasion of the Gauls, which is
noticed in looser terms by Heraclides Ponticus, (Plutarch in Camillo, p.
292, edit. H. Stephan.) 3. The real or fabulous embassy of the Romans to
Alexander (A. U. C. 430) is attested by Clitarchus, (Plin. iii. 9,) by
Aristus and Asclepiades, (Arrian. l. vii. p. 294, 295,) and by Memnon of
Heraclea, (apud Photium, cod. ccxxiv. p. 725,) though tacitly denied by
Livy. 4. Theophrastus (A. U. C. 440) primus externorum aliqua de Romanis
diligentius scripsit, (Plin. iii. 9.) 5. Lycophron (A. U. C. 480--500)
scattered the first seed of a Trojan colony and the fable of the Aeneid,
(Cassandra, 1226--1280.) A bold prediction before the end of the first
Punic war! * Note: Compare Niebuhr throughout. Niebuhr has written
a dissertation (Kleine Schriften, i. p. 438,) arguing from this
prediction, and on the other conclusive grounds, that the Lycophron,
the author of the Cassandra, is not the Alexandrian poet. He had been
anticipated in this sagacious criticism, as he afterwards discovered,
by a writer of no less distinction than Charles James Fox.--Letters to
Wakefield. And likewise by the author of the extraordinary translation
of this poem, that most promising scholar, Lord Royston. See the Remains
of Lord Royston, by the Rev. Henry Pepys, London, 1838.]

[Footnote 19: The tenth table, de modo sepulturae, was borrowed from
Solon, (Cicero de Legibus, ii. 23--26:) the furtem per lancem et
licium conceptum, is derived by Heineccius from the manners of Athens,
(Antiquitat. Rom. tom. ii. p. 167--175.) The right of killing a
nocturnal thief was declared by Moses, Solon, and the Decemvirs, (Exodus
xxii. 3. Demosthenes contra Timocratem, tom. i. p. 736, edit. Reiske.
Macrob. Saturnalia, l. i. c. 4. Collatio Legum Mosaicarum et Romanatum,
tit, vii. No. i. p. 218, edit. Cannegieter.) *Note: Are not the same
points of similarity discovered in the legislation of all actions in the
infancy of their civilization?--W.]
