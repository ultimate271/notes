## Chapter LV: The Bulgarians, The Hungarians And The Russians.--Part II.

It is the observation of the Imperial author of the Tactics, [29] that
all the Scythian hordes resembled each other in their pastoral and
military life, that they all practised the same means of subsistence,
and employed the same instruments of destruction. But he adds, that
the two nations of Bulgarians and Hungarians were superior to their
brethren, and similar to each other in the improvements, however rude,
of their discipline and government: their visible likeness determines
Leo to confound his friends and enemies in one common description; and
the picture may be heightened by some strokes from their contemporaries
of the tenth century. Except the merit and fame of military prowess,
all that is valued by mankind appeared vile and contemptible to these
Barbarians, whose native fierceness was stimulated by the consciousness
of numbers and freedom. The tents of the Hungarians were of leather,
their garments of fur; they shaved their hair, and scarified their
faces: in speech they were slow, in action prompt, in treaty perfidious;
and they shared the common reproach of Barbarians, too ignorant to
conceive the importance of truth, too proud to deny or palliate the
breach of their most solemn engagements. Their simplicity has been
praised; yet they abstained only from the luxury they had never known;
whatever they saw they coveted; their desires were insatiate, and their
sole industry was the hand of violence and rapine. By the definition of
a pastoral nation, I have recalled a long description of the economy,
the warfare, and the government that prevail in that state of society;
I may add, that to fishing, as well as to the chase, the Hungarians
were indebted for a part of their subsistence; and since they seldom
cultivated the ground, they must, at least in their new settlements,
have sometimes practised a slight and unskilful husbandry. In their
emigrations, perhaps in their expeditions, the host was accompanied
by thousands of sheep and oxen which increased the cloud of formidable
dust, and afforded a constant and wholesale supply of milk and animal
food. A plentiful command of forage was the first care of the general,
and if the flocks and herds were secure of their pastures, the hardy
warrior was alike insensible of danger and fatigue. The confusion of men
and cattle that overspread the country exposed their camp to a nocturnal
surprise, had not a still wider circuit been occupied by their light
cavalry, perpetually in motion to discover and delay the approach of the
enemy. After some experience of the Roman tactics, they adopted the
use of the sword and spear, the helmet of the soldier, and the iron
breastplate of his steed: but their native and deadly weapon was the
Tartar bow: from the earliest infancy their children and servants were
exercised in the double science of archery and horsemanship; their arm
was strong; their aim was sure; and in the most rapid career, they were
taught to throw themselves backwards, and to shoot a volley of arrows
into the air. In open combat, in secret ambush, in flight, or pursuit,
they were equally formidable; an appearance of order was maintained
in the foremost ranks, but their charge was driven forwards by the
impatient pressure of succeeding crowds. They pursued, headlong and
rash, with loosened reins and horrific outcries; but, if they fled, with
real or dissembled fear, the ardor of a pursuing foe was checked and
chastised by the same habits of irregular speed and sudden evolution.
In the abuse of victory, they astonished Europe, yet smarting from the
wounds of the Saracen and the Dane: mercy they rarely asked, and more
rarely bestowed: both sexes were accused is equally inaccessible to
pity, and their appetite for raw flesh might countenance the popular
tale, that they drank the blood, and feasted on the hearts of the slain.
Yet the Hungarians were not devoid of those principles of justice and
humanity, which nature has implanted in every bosom. The license of
public and private injuries was restrained by laws and punishments; and
in the security of an open camp, theft is the most tempting and
most dangerous offence. Among the Barbarians there were many, whose
spontaneous virtue supplied their laws and corrected their manners, who
performed the duties, and sympathized with the affections, of social
life.

[Footnote 29: Leo has observed, that the government of the Turks was
monarchical, and that their punishments were rigorous, (Tactic. p. 896)
Rhegino (in Chron. A.D. 889) mentions theft as a capital crime, and his
jurisprudence is confirmed by the original code of St. Stephen, (A.D.
1016.) If a slave were guilty, he was chastised, for the first time,
with the loss of his nose, or a fine of five heifers; for the second,
with the loss of his ears, or a similar fine; for the third, with death;
which the freeman did not incur till the fourth offence, as his first
penalty was the loss of liberty, (Katona, Hist. Regum Hungar tom. i. p.
231, 232.)]

After a long pilgrimage of flight or victory, the Turkish hordes
approached the common limits of the French and Byzantine empires. Their
first conquests and final settlements extended on either side of the
Danube above Vienna, below Belgrade, and beyond the measure of the Roman
province of Pannonia, or the modern kingdom of Hungary. [30] That ample
and fertile land was loosely occupied by the Moravians, a Sclavonian
name and tribe, which were driven by the invaders into the compass of a
narrow province. Charlemagne had stretched a vague and nominal empire
as far as the edge of Transylvania; but, after the failure of his
legitimate line, the dukes of Moravia forgot their obedience and tribute
to the monarchs of Oriental France. The bastard Arnulph was provoked to
invite the arms of the Turks: they rushed through the real or figurative
wall, which his indiscretion had thrown open; and the king of Germany
has been justly reproached as a traitor to the civil and ecclesiastical
society of the Christians. During the life of Arnulph, the Hungarians
were checked by gratitude or fear; but in the infancy of his son Lewis
they discovered and invaded Bavaria; and such was their Scythian speed,
that in a single day a circuit of fifty miles was stripped and consumed.
In the battle of Augsburgh the Christians maintained their advantage
till the seventh hour of the day, they were deceived and vanquished by
the flying stratagems of the Turkish cavalry. The conflagration spread
over the provinces of Bavaria, Swabia, and Franconia; and the Hungarians
[31] promoted the reign of anarchy, by forcing the stoutest barons to
discipline their vassals and fortify their castles. The origin of walled
towns is ascribed to this calamitous period; nor could any distance be
secure against an enemy, who, almost at the same instant, laid in ashes
the Helvetian monastery of St. Gall, and the city of Bremen, on the
shores of the northern ocean. Above thirty years the Germanic empire,
or kingdom, was subject to the ignominy of tribute; and resistance was
disarmed by the menace, the serious and effectual menace of dragging the
women and children into captivity, and of slaughtering the males above
the age of ten years. I have neither power nor inclination to follow the
Hungarians beyond the Rhine; but I must observe with surprise, that
the southern provinces of France were blasted by the tempest, and that
Spain, behind her Pyrenees, was astonished at the approach of these
formidable strangers. [32] The vicinity of Italy had tempted their early
inroads; but from their camp on the Brenta, they beheld with some terror
the apparent strength and populousness of the new discovered country.
They requested leave to retire; their request was proudly rejected by
the Italian king; and the lives of twenty thousand Christians paid the
forfeit of his obstinacy and rashness. Among the cities of the West, the
royal Pavia was conspicuous in fame and splendor; and the preeminence
of Rome itself was only derived from the relics of the apostles. The
Hungarians appeared; Pavia was in flames; forty-three churches were
consumed; and, after the massacre of the people, they spared about two
hundred wretches who had gathered some bushels of gold and silver (a
vague exaggeration) from the smoking ruins of their country. In these
annual excursions from the Alps to the neighborhood of Rome and Capua,
the churches, that yet escaped, resounded with a fearful litany: "O,
save and deliver us from the arrows of the Hungarians!" But the saints
were deaf or inexorable; and the torrent rolled forwards, till it was
stopped by the extreme land of Calabria. [33] A composition was offered
and accepted for the head of each Italian subject; and ten bushels
of silver were poured forth in the Turkish camp. But falsehood is the
natural antagonist of violence; and the robbers were defrauded both in
the numbers of the assessment and the standard of the metal. On the side
of the East, the Hungarians were opposed in doubtful conflict by the
equal arms of the Bulgarians, whose faith forbade an alliance with the
Pagans, and whose situation formed the barrier of the Byzantine empire.
The barrier was overturned; the emperor of Constantinople beheld the
waving banners of the Turks; and one of their boldest warriors presumed
to strike a battle-axe into the golden gate. The arts and treasures
of the Greeks diverted the assault; but the Hungarians might boast, in
their retreat, that they had imposed a tribute on the spirit of Bulgaria
and the majesty of the Caesars. [34] The remote and rapid operations of
the same campaign appear to magnify the power and numbers of the Turks;
but their courage is most deserving of praise, since a light troop of
three or four hundred horse would often attempt and execute the most
daring inroads to the gates of Thessalonica and Constantinople. At this
disastrous aera of the ninth and tenth centuries, Europe was afflicted
by a triple scourge from the North, the East, and the South: the Norman,
the Hungarian, and the Saracen, sometimes trod the same ground of
desolation; and these savage foes might have been compared by Homer
to the two lions growling over the carcass of a mangled stag. [35]
[Footnote 30: See Katona, Hist. Ducum Hungar. p. 321-352.]

[Footnote 31: Hungarorum gens, cujus omnes fere nationes expertae
saevitium &c., is the preface of Liutprand, (l. i. c. 2,) who frequently
expatiated on the calamities of his own times. See l. i. c. 5, l. ii. c.
1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7; l. iii. c. 1, &c., l. v. c. 8, 15, in Legat. p. 485.
His colors are glaring but his chronology must be rectified by Pagi and
Muratori.]

[Footnote 32: The three bloody reigns of Arpad, Zoltan, and Toxus, are
critically illustrated by Katona, (Hist. Ducum, &c. p. 107-499.) His
diligence has searched both natives and foreigners; yet to the deeds of
mischief, or glory, I have been able to add the destruction of Bremen,
(Adam Bremensis, i. 43.)]

[Footnote 33: Muratori has considered with patriotic care the danger and
resources of Modena. The citizens besought St. Geminianus, their patron,
to avert, by his intercession, the rabies, flagellum, &c. Nunc te
rogamus, licet servi pessimi, Ab Ungerorum nos defendas jaculis.The
bishop erected walls for the public defence, not contra dominos serenos,
(Antiquitat. Ital. Med. Aevi, tom. i. dissertat. i. p. 21, 22,) and the
song of the nightly watch is not without elegance or use, (tom. iii.
dis. xl. p. 709.) The Italian annalist has accurately traced the series
of their inroads, (Annali d' Italia, tom. vii. p. 365, 367, 398, 401,
437, 440, tom. viii. p. 19, 41, 52, &c.)]

[Footnote 34: Both the Hungarian and Russian annals suppose, that they
besieged, or attacked, or insulted Constantinople, (Pray, dissertat.
x. p. 239. Katona, Hist. Ducum, p. 354-360;) and the fact is almost
confessed by the Byzantine historians, (Leo Grammaticus, p. 506.
Cedrenus, tom. ii. p. 629: ) yet, however glorious to the nation, it is
denied or doubted by the critical historian, and even by the notary of
Bela. Their scepticism is meritorious; they could not safely transcribe
or believe the rusticorum fabulas: but Katona might have given due
attention to the evidence of Liutprand, Bulgarorum gentem atque daecorum
tributariam fecerant, (Hist. l. ii. c. 4, p. 435.)]

[Footnote 35:--Iliad, xvi. 756.]

The deliverance of Germany and Christendom was achieved by the Saxon
princes, Henry the Fowler and Otho the Great, who, in two memorable
battles, forever broke the power of the Hungarians. [36] The valiant
Henry was roused from a bed of sickness by the invasion of his country;
but his mind was vigorous and his prudence successful. "My companions,"
said he, on the morning of the combat, "maintain your ranks, receive on
your bucklers the first arrows of the Pagans, and prevent their second
discharge by the equal and rapid career of your lances." They obeyed
and conquered: and the historical picture of the castle of Merseburgh
expressed the features, or at least the character, of Henry, who, in
an age of ignorance, intrusted to the finer arts the perpetuity of his
name. [37] At the end of twenty years, the children of the Turks who had
fallen by his sword invaded the empire of his son; and their force is
defined, in the lowest estimate, at one hundred thousand horse.
They were invited by domestic faction; the gates of Germany were
treacherously unlocked; and they spread, far beyond the Rhine and the
Meuse, into the heart of Flanders. But the vigor and prudence of Otho
dispelled the conspiracy; the princes were made sensible that
unless they were true to each other, their religion and country were
irrecoverably lost; and the national powers were reviewed in the plains
of Augsburgh. They marched and fought in eight legions, according to
the division of provinces and tribes; the first, second, and third, were
composed of Bavarians; the fourth, of Franconians; the fifth, of Saxons,
under the immediate command of the monarch; the sixth and seventh
consisted of Swabians; and the eighth legion, of a thousand Bohemians,
closed the rear of the host. The resources of discipline and valor were
fortified by the arts of superstition, which, on this occasion, may
deserve the epithets of generous and salutary. The soldiers were
purified with a fast; the camp was blessed with the relics of saints
and martyrs; and the Christian hero girded on his side the sword of
Constantine, grasped the invincible spear of Charlemagne, and waved
the banner of St. Maurice, the praefect of the Thebaean legion. But his
firmest confidence was placed in the holy lance, [38] whose point was
fashioned of the nails of the cross, and which his father had extorted
from the king of Burgundy, by the threats of war, and the gift of a
province. The Hungarians were expected in the front; they secretly
passed the Lech, a river of Bavaria that falls into the Danube; turned
the rear of the Christian army; plundered the baggage, and disordered
the legion of Bohemia and Swabia. The battle was restored by the
Franconians, whose duke, the valiant Conrad, was pierced with an arrow
as he rested from his fatigues: the Saxons fought under the eyes of
their king; and his victory surpassed, in merit and importance, the
triumphs of the last two hundred years. The loss of the Hungarians was
still greater in the flight than in the action; they were encompassed by
the rivers of Bavaria; and their past cruelties excluded them from
the hope of mercy. Three captive princes were hanged at Ratisbon, the
multitude of prisoners was slain or mutilated, and the fugitives, who
presumed to appear in the face of their country, were condemned to
everlasting poverty and disgrace. [39] Yet the spirit of the nation was
humbled, and the most accessible passes of Hungary were fortified with
a ditch and rampart. Adversity suggested the counsels of moderation and
peace: the robbers of the West acquiesced in a sedentary life; and the
next generation was taught, by a discerning prince, that far more might
be gained by multiplying and exchanging the produce of a fruitful soil.
The native race, the Turkish or Fennic blood, was mingled with new
colonies of Scythian or Sclavonian origin; [40] many thousands of robust
and industrious captives had been imported from all the countries of
Europe; [41] and after the marriage of Geisa with a Bavarian princess,
he bestowed honors and estates on the nobles of Germany. [42] The son of
Geisa was invested with the regal title, and the house of Arpad
reigned three hundred years in the kingdom of Hungary. But the freeborn
Barbarians were not dazzled by the lustre of the diadem, and the people
asserted their indefeasible right of choosing, deposing, and punishing
the hereditary servant of the state.

[Footnote 36: They are amply and critically discussed by Katona, (Hist.
Dacum, p. 360-368, 427-470.) Liutprand (l. ii. c. 8, 9) is the best
evidence for the former, and Witichind (Annal. Saxon. l. iii.) of the
latter; but the critical historian will not even overlook the horn of a
warrior, which is said to be preserved at Jaz-berid.]

[Footnote 37: Hunc vero triumphum, tam laude quam memoria dignum, ad
Meresburgum rex in superiori coenaculo domus per Zeus, id est, picturam,
notari praecepit, adeo ut rem veram potius quam verisimilem videas: a
high encomium, (Liutprand, l. ii. c. 9.) Another palace in Germany
had been painted with holy subjects by the order of Charlemagne; and
Muratori may justly affirm, nulla saecula fuere in quibus pictores
desiderati fuerint, (Antiquitat. Ital. Medii Aevi, tom. ii. dissert.
xxiv. p. 360, 361.) Our domestic claims to antiquity of ignorance and
original imperfection (Mr. Walpole's lively words) are of a much more
recent date, (Anecdotes of Painting, vol. i. p. 2, &c.)]

[Footnote 38: See Baronius, Annal. Eccles. A.D. 929, No. 2-5. The lance
of Christ is taken from the best evidence, Liutprand, (l. iv. c. 12,)
Sigebert, and the Acts of St. Gerard: but the other military relics
depend on the faith of the Gesta Anglorum post Bedam, l. ii. c. 8.]

[Footnote 39: Katona, Hist. Ducum Hungariae, p. 500, &c.]

[Footnote 40: Among these colonies we may distinguish, 1. The Chazars,
or Cabari, who joined the Hungarians on their march, (Constant. de
Admin. Imp. c. 39, 40, p. 108, 109.) 2. The Jazyges, Moravians, and
Siculi, whom they found in the land; the last were perhaps a remnant of
the Huns of Attila, and were intrusted with the guard of the borders. 3.
The Russians, who, like the Swiss in France, imparted a general name
to the royal porters. 4. The Bulgarians, whose chiefs (A.D. 956)
were invited, cum magna multitudine Hismahelitarum. Had any of those
Sclavonians embraced the Mahometan religion? 5. The Bisseni and Cumans,
a mixed multitude of Patzinacites, Uzi, Chazars, &c., who had spread
to the Lower Danube. The last colony of 40,000 Cumans, A.D. 1239, was
received and converted by the kings of Hungary, who derived from that
tribe a new regal appellation, (Pray, Dissert. vi. vii. p. 109-173.
Katona, Hist. Ducum, p. 95-99, 259-264, 476, 479-483, &c.)]

[Footnote 41: Christiani autem, quorum pars major populi est, qui ex
omni parte mundi illuc tracti sunt captivi, &c. Such was the language
of Piligrinus, the first missionary who entered Hungary, A.D. 973. Pars
major is strong. Hist. Ducum, p. 517.]

[Footnote 42: The fideles Teutonici of Geisa are authenticated in old
charters: and Katona, with his usual industry, has made a fair estimate
of these colonies, which had been so loosely magnified by the Italian
Ranzanus, (Hist. Critic. Ducum. p, 667-681.)]

III. The name of Russians [43] was first divulged, in the ninth century,
by an embassy of Theophilus, emperor of the East, to the emperor of the
West, Lewis, the son of Charlemagne. The Greeks were accompanied by the
envoys of the great duke, or chagan, or czar, of the Russians. In their
journey to Constantinople, they had traversed many hostile nations;
and they hoped to escape the dangers of their return, by requesting
the French monarch to transport them by sea to their native country. A
closer examination detected their origin: they were the brethren of
the Swedes and Normans, whose name was already odious and formidable in
France; and it might justly be apprehended, that these Russian strangers
were not the messengers of peace, but the emissaries of war. They were
detained, while the Greeks were dismissed; and Lewis expected a more
satisfactory account, that he might obey the laws of hospitality
or prudence, according to the interest of both empires. [44] This
Scandinavian origin of the people, or at least the princes, of Russia,
may be confirmed and illustrated by the national annals [45] and
the general history of the North. The Normans, who had so long been
concealed by a veil of impenetrable darkness, suddenly burst forth in
the spirit of naval and military enterprise. The vast, and, as it is
said, the populous regions of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, were crowded
with independent chieftains and desperate adventurers, who sighed in the
laziness of peace, and smiled in the agonies of death. Piracy was the
exercise, the trade, the glory, and the virtue, of the Scandinavian
youth. Impatient of a bleak climate and narrow limits, they started
from the banquet, grasped their arms, sounded their horn, ascended
their vessels, and explored every coast that promised either spoil or
settlement. The Baltic was the first scene of their naval achievements
they visited the eastern shores, the silent residence of Fennic and
Sclavonic tribes, and the primitive Russians of the Lake Ladoga paid
a tribute, the skins of white squirrels, to these strangers, whom they
saluted with the title of Varangians [46] or Corsairs. Their superiority
in arms, discipline, and renown, commanded the fear and reverence of the
natives. In their wars against the more inland savages, the Varangians
condescended to serve as friends and auxiliaries, and gradually, by
choice or conquest, obtained the dominion of a people whom they were
qualified to protect. Their tyranny was expelled, their valor was again
recalled, till at length Ruric, a Scandinavian chief, became the father
of a dynasty which reigned above seven hundred years. His brothers
extended his influence: the example of service and usurpation was
imitated by his companions in the southern provinces of Russia; and
their establishments, by the usual methods of war and assassination,
were cemented into the fabric of a powerful monarchy.

[Footnote 43: Among the Greeks, this national appellation has a singular
form, as an undeclinable word, of which many fanciful etymologies have
been suggested. I have perused, with pleasure and profit, a dissertation
de Origine Russorum (Comment. Academ. Petropolitanae, tom. viii. p.
388-436) by Theophilus Sigefrid Bayer, a learned German, who spent
his life and labors in the service of Russia. A geographical tract of
D'Anville, de l'Empire de Russie, son Origine, et ses Accroissemens,
(Paris, 1772, in 12mo.,) has likewise been of use. * Note: The later
antiquarians of Russia and Germany appear to aquiesce in the authority
of the monk Nestor, the earliest annalist of Russia, who derives the
Russians, or Vareques, from Scandinavia. The names of the first founders
of the Russian monarchy are Scandinavian or Norman. Their language
(according to Const. Porphyrog. de Administrat. Imper. c. 9) differed
essentially from the Sclavonian. The author of the Annals of St. Bertin,
who first names the Russians (Rhos) in the year 839 of his Annals,
assigns them Sweden for their country. So Liutprand calls the Russians
the same people as the Normans. The Fins, Laplanders, and Esthonians,
call the Swedes, to the present day, Roots, Rootsi, Ruotzi, Rootslaue.

the aera of Ruric. In the xth century, Liutprand (Hist. l. v. c. 6)
speaks of the Russians and Normans as the same Aquilonares homines of a
red complexion.]

[Footnote 45: My knowledge of these annals is drawn from M. Leveque,
Histoire de Russie. Nestor, the first and best of these ancient
annalists, was a monk of Kiow, who died in the beginning of the xiith
century; but his Chronicle was obscure, till it was published at
Petersburgh, 1767, in 4to. Leveque, Hist. de Russie, tom. i. p. xvi.

As long as the descendants of Ruric were considered as aliens and
conquerors, they ruled by the sword of the Varangians, distributed
estates and subjects to their faithful captains, and supplied their
numbers with fresh streams of adventurers from the Baltic coast. [47]
But when the Scandinavian chiefs had struck a deep and permanent root
into the soil, they mingled with the Russians in blood, religion,
and language, and the first Waladimir had the merit of delivering his
country from these foreign mercenaries. They had seated him on the
throne; his riches were insufficient to satisfy their demands; but
they listened to his pleasing advice, that they should seek, not a
more grateful, but a more wealthy, master; that they should embark for
Greece, where, instead of the skins of squirrels, silk and gold would
be the recompense of their service. At the same time, the Russian prince
admonished his Byzantine ally to disperse and employ, to recompense and
restrain, these impetuous children of the North. Contemporary writers
have recorded the introduction, name, and character, of the Varangians:
each day they rose in confidence and esteem; the whole body was
assembled at Constantinople to perform the duty of guards; and their
strength was recruited by a numerous band of their countrymen from the
Island of Thule. On this occasion, the vague appellation of Thule is
applied to England; and the new Varangians were a colony of English
and Danes who fled from the yoke of the Norman conqueror. The habits of
pilgrimage and piracy had approximated the countries of the earth; these
exiles were entertained in the Byzantine court; and they preserved, till
the last age of the empire, the inheritance of spotless loyalty, and the
use of the Danish or English tongue. With their broad and double-edged
battle-axes on their shoulders, they attended the Greek emperor to the
temple, the senate, and the hippodrome; he slept and feasted under their
trusty guard; and the keys of the palace, the treasury, and the capital,
were held by the firm and faithful hands of the Varangians. [48]

[Footnote 47: Yet, as late as the year 1018, Kiow and Russia were still
guarded ex fugitivorum servorum robore, confluentium et maxime Danorum.
Bayer, who quotes (p. 292) the Chronicle of Dithmar of Merseburgh,
observes, that it was unusual for the Germans to enlist in a foreign
service.]

[Footnote 48: Ducange has collected from the original authors the state
and history of the Varangi at Constantinople, (Glossar. Med. et Infimae
Graecitatis, sub voce. Med. et Infimae Latinitatis, sub voce Vagri. Not.
ad Alexiad. Annae Comnenae, p. 256, 257, 258. Notes sur Villehardouin,
p. 296-299.) See likewise the annotations of Reiske to the Ceremoniale
Aulae Byzant. of Constantine, tom. ii. p. 149, 150. Saxo Grammaticus
affirms that they spoke Danish; but Codinus maintains them till the
fifteenth century in the use of their native English.]

In the tenth century, the geography of Scythia was extended far beyond
the limits of ancient knowledge; and the monarchy of the Russians
obtains a vast and conspicuous place in the map of Constantine. [49]
The sons of Ruric were masters of the spacious province of Wolodomir,
or Moscow; and, if they were confined on that side by the hordes of the
East, their western frontier in those early days was enlarged to the
Baltic Sea and the country of the Prussians. Their northern reign
ascended above the sixtieth degree of latitude over the Hyperborean
regions, which fancy had peopled with monsters, or clouded with eternal
darkness. To the south they followed the course of the Borysthenes,
and approached with that river the neighborhood of the Euxine Sea. The
tribes that dwelt, or wandered, in this ample circuit were obedient to
the same conqueror, and insensibly blended into the same nation. The
language of Russia is a dialect of the Sclavonian; but in the tenth
century, these two modes of speech were different from each other; and,
as the Sclavonian prevailed in the South, it may be presumed that the
original Russians of the North, the primitive subjects of the Varangian
chief, were a portion of the Fennic race. With the emigration, union, or
dissolution, of the wandering tribes, the loose and indefinite picture
of the Scythian desert has continually shifted. But the most ancient
map of Russia affords some places which still retain their name and
position; and the two capitals, Novogorod [50] and Kiow, [51] are coeval
with the first age of the monarchy. Novogorod had not yet deserved
the epithet of great, nor the alliance of the Hanseatic League, which
diffused the streams of opulence and the principles of freedom. Kiow
could not yet boast of three hundred churches, an innumerable people,
and a degree of greatness and splendor which was compared with
Constantinople by those who had never seen the residence of the Caesars.
In their origin, the two cities were no more than camps or fairs, the
most convenient stations in which the Barbarians might assemble for the
occasional business of war or trade. Yet even these assemblies announce
some progress in the arts of society; a new breed of cattle was imported
from the southern provinces; and the spirit of commercial enterprise
pervaded the sea and land, from the Baltic to the Euxine, from the mouth
of the Oder to the port of Constantinople. In the days of idolatry and
barbarism, the Sclavonic city of Julin was frequented and enriched
by the Normans, who had prudently secured a free mart of purchase
and exchange. [52] From this harbor, at the entrance of the Oder, the
corsair, or merchant, sailed in forty-three days to the eastern shores
of the Baltic, the most distant nations were intermingled, and the
holy groves of Curland are said to have been decorated with Grecian and
Spanish gold. [53] Between the sea and Novogorod an easy intercourse
was discovered; in the summer, through a gulf, a lake, and a navigable
river; in the winter season, over the hard and level surface of
boundless snows. From the neighborhood of that city, the Russians
descended the streams that fall into the Borysthenes; their canoes, of a
single tree, were laden with slaves of every age, furs of every species,
the spoil of their beehives, and the hides of their cattle; and the
whole produce of the North was collected and discharged in the magazines
of Kiow. The month of June was the ordinary season of the departure of
the fleet: the timber of the canoes was framed into the oars and benches
of more solid and capacious boats; and they proceeded without obstacle
down the Borysthenes, as far as the seven or thirteen ridges of rocks,
which traverse the bed, and precipitate the waters, of the river. At
the more shallow falls it was sufficient to lighten the vessels; but the
deeper cataracts were impassable; and the mariners, who dragged their
vessels and their slaves six miles over land, were exposed in this
toilsome journey to the robbers of the desert. [54] At the first island
below the falls, the Russians celebrated the festival of their escape:
at a second, near the mouth of the river, they repaired their shattered
vessels for the longer and more perilous voyage of the Black Sea. If
they steered along the coast, the Danube was accessible; with a fair
wind they could reach in thirty-six or forty hours the opposite shores
of Anatolia; and Constantinople admitted the annual visit of the
strangers of the North. They returned at the stated season with a rich
cargo of corn, wine, and oil, the manufactures of Greece, and the spices
of India. Some of their countrymen resided in the capital and
provinces; and the national treaties protected the persons, effects, and
privileges, of the Russian merchant. [55]

[Footnote 49: The original record of the geography and trade of Russia
is produced by the emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus, (de Administrat.
Imperii, c. 2, p. 55, 56, c. 9, p. 59-61, c. 13, p. 63-67, c. 37, p.
106, c. 42, p. 112, 113,) and illustrated by the diligence of Bayer, (de
Geographia Russiae vicinarumque Regionum circiter A. C. 948, in Comment.
Academ. Petropol. tom. ix. p. 367-422, tom. x. p. 371-421,) with the
aid of the chronicles and traditions of Russia, Scandinavia, &c.]

[Footnote 50: The haughty proverb, "Who can resist God and the great
Novogorod?" is applied by M. Leveque (Hist. de Russie, tom. i. p. 60)
even to the times that preceded the reign of Ruric. In the course of
his history he frequently celebrates this republic, which was suppressed
A.D. 1475, (tom. ii. p. 252-266.) That accurate traveller Adam Olearius
describes (in 1635) the remains of Novogorod, and the route by sea and
land of the Holstein ambassadors, tom. i. p. 123-129.]

[Footnote 51: In hac magna civitate, quae est caput regni, plus
trecentae ecclesiae habentur et nundinae octo, populi etiam ignota manus
(Eggehardus ad A.D. 1018, apud Bayer, tom. ix. p. 412.) He likewise
quotes (tom. x. p. 397) the words of the Saxon annalist, Cujus (Russioe)
metropolis est Chive, aemula sceptri Constantinopolitani, quae est
clarissimum decus Graeciae. The fame of Kiow, especially in the xith
century, had reached the German and Arabian geographers.]

[Footnote 52: In Odorae ostio qua Scythicas alluit paludes, nobilissima
civitas Julinum, celeberrimam, Barbaris et Graecis qui sunt in circuitu,
praestans stationem, est sane maxima omnium quas Europa claudit
civitatum, (Adam Bremensis, Hist. Eccles. p. 19;) a strange exaggeration
even in the xith century. The trade of the Baltic, and the Hanseatic
League, are carefully treated in Anderson's Historical Deduction of
Commerce; at least, in our language, I am not acquainted with any book
so satisfactory. * Note: The book of authority is the "Geschichte des
Hanseatischen Bundes," by George Sartorius, Gottingen, 1803, or rather
the later edition of that work by M. Lappenberg, 2 vols. 4to., Hamburgh,
1830.--M. 1845.]

[Footnote 53: According to Adam of Bremen, (de Situ Daniae, p. 58,) the
old Curland extended eight days' journey along the coast; and by Peter
Teutoburgicus, (p. 68, A.D. 1326,) Memel is defined as the common
frontier of Russia, Curland, and Prussia. Aurum ibi plurimum, (says
Adam,) divinis auguribus atque necromanticis omnes domus sunt plenae....
a toto orbe ibi responsa petuntur, maxime ab Hispanis (forsan Zupanis,
id est regulis Lettoviae) et Graecis. The name of Greeks was applied to
the Russians even before their conversion; an imperfect conversion, if
they still consulted the wizards of Curland, (Bayer, tom. x. p. 378,
402, &c. Grotius, Prolegomen. ad Hist. Goth. p. 99.)]

[Footnote 54: Constantine only reckons seven cataracts, of which he
gives the Russian and Sclavonic names; but thirteen are enumerated by
the Sieur de Beauplan, a French engineer, who had surveyed the
course and navigation of the Dnieper, or Borysthenes, (Description de
l'Ukraine, Rouen, 1660, a thin quarto;) but the map is unluckily wanting
in my copy.]

[Footnote 55: Nestor, apud Leveque, Hist. de Russie, tom. i. p. 78-80.
From the Dnieper, or Borysthenes, the Russians went to Black Bulgaria,
Chazaria, and Syria. To Syria, how? where? when? The alteration
is slight; the position of Suania, between Chazaria and Lazica, is
perfectly suitable; and the name was still used in the xith century,
(Cedren. tom. ii. p. 770.)]
