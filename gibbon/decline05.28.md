## Chapter LIII: Fate Of The Eastern Empire.--Part II.

I must repeat the complaint that the vague and scanty memorials of the
times will not afford any just estimate of the taxes, the revenue, and
the resources of the Greek empire. From every province of Europe and
Asia the rivulets of gold and silver discharged into the Imperial
reservoir a copious and perennial stream. The separation of the branches
from the trunk increased the relative magnitude of Constantinople; and
the maxims of despotism contracted the state to the capital, the capital
to the palace, and the palace to the royal person. A Jewish traveller,
who visited the East in the twelfth century, is lost in his admiration
of the Byzantine riches. "It is here," says Benjamin of Tudela, "in
the queen of cities, that the tributes of the Greek empire are annually
deposited and the lofty towers are filled with precious magazines of
silk, purple, and gold. It is said, that Constantinople pays each day
to her sovereign twenty thousand pieces of gold; which are levied on the
shops, taverns, and markets, on the merchants of Persia and Egypt, of
Russia and Hungary, of Italy and Spain, who frequent the capital by
sea and land." [28] In all pecuniary matters, the authority of a Jew
is doubtless respectable; but as the three hundred and sixty-five days
would produce a yearly income exceeding seven millions sterling, I
am tempted to retrench at least the numerous festivals of the Greek
calendar. The mass of treasure that was saved by Theodora and Basil
the Second will suggest a splendid, though indefinite, idea of their
supplies and resources. The mother of Michael, before she retired to a
cloister, attempted to check or expose the prodigality of her ungrateful
son, by a free and faithful account of the wealth which he inherited;
one hundred and nine thousand pounds of gold, and three hundred thousand
of silver, the fruits of her own economy and that of her deceased
husband. [29] The avarice of Basil is not less renowned than his valor
and fortune: his victorious armies were paid and rewarded without
breaking into the mass of two hundred thousand pounds of gold, (about
eight millions sterling,) which he had buried in the subterraneous
vaults of the palace. [30] Such accumulation of treasure is rejected by
the theory and practice of modern policy; and we are more apt to compute
the national riches by the use and abuse of the public credit. Yet the
maxims of antiquity are still embraced by a monarch formidable to his
enemies; by a republic respectable to her allies; and both have attained
their respective ends of military power and domestic tranquillity.

uses the more classic appellation of talents, which, in a literal
sense and strict computation, would multiply sixty fold the treasure of
Basil.]

Whatever might be consumed for the present wants, or reserved for the
future use, of the state, the first and most sacred demand was for the
pomp and pleasure of the emperor, and his discretion only could define
the measure of his private expense. The princes of Constantinople were
far removed from the simplicity of nature; yet, with the revolving
seasons, they were led by taste or fashion to withdraw to a purer air,
from the smoke and tumult of the capital. They enjoyed, or affected to
enjoy, the rustic festival of the vintage: their leisure was amused by
the exercise of the chase and the calmer occupation of fishing, and in
the summer heats, they were shaded from the sun, and refreshed by the
cooling breezes from the sea. The coasts and islands of Asia and Europe
were covered with their magnificent villas; but, instead of the modest
art which secretly strives to hide itself and to decorate the scenery of
nature, the marble structure of their gardens served only to expose
the riches of the lord, and the labors of the architect. The successive
casualties of inheritance and forfeiture had rendered the sovereign
proprietor of many stately houses in the city and suburbs, of which
twelve were appropriated to the ministers of state; but the great
palace, [31] the centre of the Imperial residence, was fixed during
eleven centuries to the same position, between the hippodrome, the
cathedral of St. Sophia, and the gardens, which descended by many a
terrace to the shores of the Propontis. The primitive edifice of the
first Constantine was a copy, or rival, of ancient Rome; the gradual
improvements of his successors aspired to emulate the wonders of the old
world, [32] and in the tenth century, the Byzantine palace excited the
admiration, at least of the Latins, by an unquestionable preeminence of
strength, size, and magnificence. [33] But the toil and treasure of so
many ages had produced a vast and irregular pile: each separate building
was marked with the character of the times and of the founder; and the
want of space might excuse the reigning monarch, who demolished, perhaps
with secret satisfaction, the works of his predecessors. The economy
of the emperor Theophilus allowed a more free and ample scope for his
domestic luxury and splendor. A favorite ambassador, who had astonished
the Abbassides themselves by his pride and liberality, presented on his
return the model of a palace, which the caliph of Bagdad had recently
constructed on the banks of the Tigris. The model was instantly copied
and surpassed: the new buildings of Theophilus [34] were accompanied
with gardens, and with five churches, one of which was conspicuous for
size and beauty: it was crowned with three domes, the roof of gilt brass
reposed on columns of Italian marble, and the walls were incrusted with
marbles of various colors. In the face of the church, a semicircular
portico, of the figure and name of the Greek sigma, was supported by
fifteen columns of Phrygian marble, and the subterraneous vaults were of
a similar construction. The square before the sigma was decorated with
a fountain, and the margin of the basin was lined and encompassed with
plates of silver. In the beginning of each season, the basin, instead
of water, was replenished with the most exquisite fruits, which were
abandoned to the populace for the entertainment of the prince. He
enjoyed this tumultuous spectacle from a throne resplendent with gold
and gems, which was raised by a marble staircase to the height of a
lofty terrace. Below the throne were seated the officers of his guards,
the magistrates, the chiefs of the factions of the circus; the inferior
steps were occupied by the people, and the place below was covered with
troops of dancers, singers, and pantomimes. The square was surrounded
by the hall of justice, the arsenal, and the various offices of
business and pleasure; and the purple chamber was named from the annual
distribution of robes of scarlet and purple by the hand of the empress
herself. The long series of the apartments was adapted to the seasons,
and decorated with marble and porphyry, with painting, sculpture, and
mosaics, with a profusion of gold, silver, and precious stones. His
fanciful magnificence employed the skill and patience of such artists
as the times could afford: but the taste of Athens would have despised
their frivolous and costly labors; a golden tree, with its leaves and
branches, which sheltered a multitude of birds warbling their artificial
notes, and two lions of massy gold, and of natural size, who looked and
roared like their brethren of the forest. The successors of Theophilus,
of the Basilian and Comnenian dynasties, were not less ambitious of
leaving some memorial of their residence; and the portion of the palace
most splendid and august was dignified with the title of the golden
triclinium. [35] With becoming modesty, the rich and noble Greeks
aspired to imitate their sovereign, and when they passed through the
streets on horseback, in their robes of silk and embroidery, they were
mistaken by the children for kings. [36] A matron of Peloponnesus,
[37] who had cherished the infant fortunes of Basil the Macedonian, was
excited by tenderness or vanity to visit the greatness of her adopted
son. In a journey of five hundred miles from Patras to Constantinople,
her age or indolence declined the fatigue of a horse or carriage: the
soft litter or bed of Danielis was transported on the shoulders of ten
robust slaves; and as they were relieved at easy distances, a band of
three hundred were selected for the performance of this service. She
was entertained in the Byzantine palace with filial reverence, and the
honors of a queen; and whatever might be the origin of her wealth, her
gifts were not unworthy of the regal dignity. I have already described
the fine and curious manufactures of Peloponnesus, of linen, silk, and
woollen; but the most acceptable of her presents consisted in three
hundred beautiful youths, of whom one hundred were eunuchs; [38] "for
she was not ignorant," says the historian, "that the air of the palace
is more congenial to such insects, than a shepherd's dairy to the flies
of the summer." During her lifetime, she bestowed the greater part of
her estates in Peloponnesus, and her testament instituted Leo, the
son of Basil, her universal heir. After the payment of the legacies,
fourscore villas or farms were added to the Imperial domain; and three
thousand slaves of Danielis were enfranchised by their new lord, and
transplanted as a colony to the Italian coast. From this example of
a private matron, we may estimate the wealth and magnificence of the
emperors. Yet our enjoyments are confined by a narrow circle; and,
whatsoever may be its value, the luxury of life is possessed with more
innocence and safety by the master of his own, than by the steward of
the public, fortune.

In an absolute government, which levels the distinctions of noble and
plebeian birth, the sovereign is the sole fountain of honor; and the
rank, both in the palace and the empire, depends on the titles and
offices which are bestowed and resumed by his arbitrary will. Above a
thousand years, from Vespasian to Alexius Comnenus, [39] the Caesar
was the second person, or at least the second degree, after the supreme
title of Augustus was more freely communicated to the sons and brothers
of the reigning monarch. To elude without violating his promise to
a powerful associate, the husband of his sister, and, without giving
himself an equal, to reward the piety of his brother Isaac, the crafty
Alexius interposed a new and supereminent dignity. The happy flexibility
of the Greek tongue allowed him to compound the names of Augustus and
Emperor (Sebastos and Autocrator,) and the union produces the sonorous
title of Sebastocrator. He was exalted above the Caesar on the first
step of the throne: the public acclamations repeated his name; and he
was only distinguished from the sovereign by some peculiar ornaments
of the head and feet. The emperor alone could assume the purple or red
buskins, and the close diadem or tiara, which imitated the fashion of
the Persian kings. [40] It was a high pyramidal cap of cloth or silk,
almost concealed by a profusion of pearls and jewels: the crown was
formed by a horizontal circle and two arches of gold: at the summit,
the point of their intersection, was placed a globe or cross, and two
strings or lappets of pearl depended on either cheek. Instead of red,
the buskins of the Sebastocrator and Caesar were green; and on
their open coronets or crowns, the precious gems were more sparingly
distributed. Beside and below the Caesar the fancy of Alexius
created the Panhypersebastos and the Protosebastos, whose sound and
signification will satisfy a Grecian ear. They imply a superiority and
a priority above the simple name of Augustus; and this sacred and
primitive title of the Roman prince was degraded to the kinsmen and
servants of the Byzantine court. The daughter of Alexius applauds, with
fond complacency, this artful gradation of hopes and honors; but the
science of words is accessible to the meanest capacity; and this vain
dictionary was easily enriched by the pride of his successors. To their
favorite sons or brothers, they imparted the more lofty appellation
of Lord or Despot, which was illustrated with new ornaments, and
prerogatives, and placed immediately after the person of the emperor
himself. The five titles of, 1. Despot; 2. Sebastocrator; 3. Caesar; 4.
Panhypersebastos; and, 5. Protosebastos; were usually confined to the
princes of his blood: they were the emanations of his majesty; but as
they exercised no regular functions, their existence was useless, and
their authority precarious.

[Footnote 39: See the Alexiad (l. iii. p. 78, 79) of Anna Comnena, who,
except in filial piety, may be compared to Mademoiselle de Montpensier.
In her awful reverence for titles and forms, she styles her father, the
inventor of this royal art.]

[Footnote 40: See Reiske, and Ceremoniale, p. 14, 15. Ducange has given
a learned dissertation on the crowns of Constantinople, Rome, France,
&c., (sur Joinville, xxv. p. 289-303;) but of his thirty-four models,
none exactly tally with Anne's description.]

But in every monarchy the substantial powers of government must be
divided and exercised by the ministers of the palace and treasury, the
fleet and army. The titles alone can differ; and in the revolution of
ages, the counts and praefects, the praetor and quaestor, insensibly
descended, while their servants rose above their heads to the first
honors of the state. 1. In a monarchy, which refers every object to the
person of the prince, the care and ceremonies of the palace form the
most respectable department. The Curopalata, [41] so illustrious in the
age of Justinian, was supplanted by the Protovestiare, whose primitive
functions were limited to the custody of the wardrobe. From thence his
jurisdiction was extended over the numerous menials of pomp and luxury;
and he presided with his silver wand at the public and private audience.
2. In the ancient system of Constantine, the name of Logothete, or
accountant, was applied to the receivers of the finances: the principal
officers were distinguished as the Logothetes of the domain, of
the posts, the army, the private and public treasure; and the great
Logothete, the supreme guardian of the laws and revenues, is compared
with the chancellor of the Latin monarchies. [42] His discerning
eye pervaded the civil administration; and he was assisted, in due
subordination, by the eparch or praefect of the city, the first
secretary, and the keepers of the privy seal, the archives, and the red
or purple ink which was reserved for the sacred signature of the emperor
alone. [43] The introductor and interpreter of foreign ambassadors
were the great Chiauss [44] and the Dragoman, [45] two names of Turkish
origin, and which are still familiar to the Sublime Porte. 3. From the
humble style and service of guards, the Domestics insensibly rose to
the station of generals; the military themes of the East and West, the
legions of Europe and Asia, were often divided, till the great Domestic
was finally invested with the universal and absolute command of the land
forces. The Protostrator, in his original functions, was the assistant
of the emperor when he mounted on horseback: he gradually became the
lieutenant of the great Domestic in the field; and his jurisdiction
extended over the stables, the cavalry, and the royal train of hunting
and hawking. The Stratopedarch was the great judge of the camp: the
Protospathaire commanded the guards; the Constable, [46] the great
Aeteriarch, and the Acolyth, were the separate chiefs of the Franks, the
Barbarians, and the Varangi, or English, the mercenary strangers, who,
a the decay of the national spirit, formed the nerve of the Byzantine
armies. 4. The naval powers were under the command of the great Duke;
in his absence they obeyed the great Drungaire of the fleet; and, in
his place, the Emir, or Admiral, a name of Saracen extraction, [47] but
which has been naturalized in all the modern languages of Europe. Of
these officers, and of many more whom it would be useless to enumerate,
the civil and military hierarchy was framed. Their honors and
emoluments, their dress and titles, their mutual salutations and
respective preeminence, were balanced with more exquisite labor than
would have fixed the constitution of a free people; and the code was
almost perfect when this baseless fabric, the monument of pride and
servitude, was forever buried in the ruins of the empire. [48]

[Footnote 41: Par exstans curis, solo diademate dispar, Ordine pro rerum
vocitatus Cura-Palati, says the African Corippus, (de Laudibus Justini,
l. i. 136,) and in the same century (the vith) Cassiodorus represents
him, who, virga aurea decoratus, inter numerosa obsequia primus
ante pedes regis incederet (Variar. vii. 5.) But this great officer,
(unknown,) exercising no function, was cast down by the modern Greeks to
the xvth rank, (Codin. c. 5, p. 65.)]

[Footnote 43: From Leo I. (A.D. 470) the Imperial ink, which is still
visible on some original acts, was a mixture of vermilion and cinnabar,
or purple. The emperor's guardians, who shared in this prerogative,
always marked in green ink the indiction and the month. See the
Dictionnaire Diplomatique, (tom. i. p. 511-513) a valuable abridgment.]

officers, (Rycaut's Ottoman Empire, p. 349, octavo edition.)]

books of Gretser, a learned Jesuit.]
