## Chapter XLVII: Ecclesiastical Discord.--Part III.

The death of the Alexandrian primate, after a reign of thirty-two years,
abandoned the Catholics to the intemperance of zeal and the abuse
of victory. [59] The monophysite doctrine (one incarnate nature) was
rigorously preached in the churches of Egypt and the monasteries of the
East; the primitive creed of Apollinarius was protected by the sanctity
of Cyril; and the name of Eutyches, his venerable friend, has been
applied to the sect most adverse to the Syrian heresy of Nestorius. His
rival Eutyches was the abbot, or archimandrite, or superior of three
hundred monks, but the opinions of a simple and illiterate recluse might
have expired in the cell, where he had slept above seventy years, if the
resentment or indiscretion of Flavian, the Byzantine pontiff, had not
exposed the scandal to the eyes of the Christian world. His domestic
synod was instantly convened, their proceedings were sullied with
clamor and artifice, and the aged heretic was surprised into a seeming
confession, that Christ had not derived his body from the substance
of the Virgin Mary. From their partial decree, Eutyches appealed to a
general council; and his cause was vigorously asserted by his godson
Chrysaphius, the reigning eunuch of the palace, and his accomplice
Dioscorus, who had succeeded to the throne, the creed, the talents,
and the vices, of the nephew of Theophilus. By the special summons of
Theodosius, the second synod of Ephesus was judiciously composed of
ten metropolitans and ten bishops from each of the six dioceses of the
Eastern empire: some exceptions of favor or merit enlarged the number to
one hundred and thirty-five; and the Syrian Barsumas, as the chief
and representative of the monks, was invited to sit and vote with
the successors of the apostles. But the despotism of the Alexandrian
patriarch again oppressed the freedom of debate: the same spiritual and
carnal weapons were again drawn from the arsenals of Egypt: the Asiatic
veterans, a band of archers, served under the orders of Dioscorus; and
the more formidable monks, whose minds were inaccessible to reason or
mercy, besieged the doors of the cathedral. The general, and, as it
should seem, the unconstrained voice of the fathers, accepted the faith
and even the anathemas of Cyril; and the heresy of the two natures
was formally condemned in the persons and writings of the most learned
Orientals. "May those who divide Christ be divided with the sword, may
they be hewn in pieces, may they be burned alive!" were the charitable
wishes of a Christian synod. [60] The innocence and sanctity of Eutyches
were acknowledged without hesitation; but the prelates, more especially
those of Thrace and Asia, were unwilling to depose their patriarch for
the use or even the abuse of his lawful jurisdiction. They embraced
the knees of Dioscorus, as he stood with a threatening aspect on the
footstool of his throne, and conjured him to forgive the offences,
and to respect the dignity, of his brother. "Do you mean to raise a
sedition?" exclaimed the relentless tyrant. "Where are the officers?" At
these words a furious multitude of monks and soldiers, with staves, and
swords, and chains, burst into the church; the trembling bishops hid
themselves behind the altar, or under the benches, and as they were
not inspired with the zeal of martyrdom, they successively subscribed
a blank paper, which was afterwards filled with the condemnation of the
Byzantine pontiff. Flavian was instantly delivered to the wild beasts of
this spiritual amphitheatre: the monks were stimulated by the voice and
example of Barsumas to avenge the injuries of Christ: it is said that
the patriarch of Alexandria reviled, and buffeted, and kicked, and
trampled his brother of Constantinople: [61] it is certain, that the
victim, before he could reach the place of his exile, expired on the
third day of the wounds and bruises which he had received at Ephesus.
This second synod has been justly branded as a gang of robbers and
assassins; yet the accusers of Dioscorus would magnify his violence, to
alleviate the cowardice and inconstancy of their own behavior.

[Footnote 59: Dixi Cyrillum dum viveret, auctoritate sua effecisse, ne
Eutychianismus et Monophysitarum error in nervum erumperet: idque verum
puto...aliquo... honesto modo cecinerat. The learned but cautious
Jablonski did not always speak the whole truth. Cum Cyrillo lenius
omnino egi, quam si tecum aut cum aliis rei hujus probe gnaris et aequis
rerum aestimatoribus sermones privatos conferrem, (Thesaur. Epistol. La
Crozian. tom. i. p. 197, 198) an excellent key to his dissertations on
the Nestorian controversy!]

[Footnote 60: At the request of Dioscorus, those who were not able to
roar, stretched out their hands. At Chalcedon, the Orientals disclaimed
these exclamations: but the Egyptians more consistently declared.
(Concil. tom. iv. p. 1012.)]

[Footnote 61: (Eusebius, bishop of Dorylaeum): and this testimony of
Evagrius (l. ii. c. 2) is amplified by the historian Zonaras, (tom. ii.
l. xiii. p. 44,) who affirms that Dioscorus kicked like a wild ass. But
the language of Liberatus (Brev. c. 12, in Concil. tom. vi. p. 438)
is more cautious; and the Acts of Chalcedon, which lavish the names
of homicide, Cain, &c., do not justify so pointed a charge. The monk
Barsumas is more particularly accused, (Concil. tom. iv. p. 1418.)]

The faith of Egypt had prevailed: but the vanquished party was supported
by the same pope who encountered without fear the hostile rage of Attila
and Genseric. The theology of Leo, his famous tome or epistle on
the mystery of the incarnation, had been disregarded by the synod of
Ephesus: his authority, and that of the Latin church, was insulted in
his legates, who escaped from slavery and death to relate the melancholy
tale of the tyranny of Dioscorus and the martyrdom of Flavian. His
provincial synod annulled the irregular proceedings of Ephesus; but
as this step was itself irregular, he solicited the convocation of a
general council in the free and orthodox provinces of Italy. From his
independent throne, the Roman bishop spoke and acted without danger
as the head of the Christians, and his dictates were obsequiously
transcribed by Placidia and her son Valentinian; who addressed their
Eastern colleague to restore the peace and unity of the church. But the
pageant of Oriental royalty was moved with equal dexterity by the hand
of the eunuch; and Theodosius could pronounce, without hesitation, that
the church was already peaceful and triumphant, and that the recent
flame had been extinguished by the just punishment of the Nestorians.
Perhaps the Greeks would be still involved in the heresy of the
Monophysites, if the emperor's horse had not fortunately stumbled;
Theodosius expired; his orthodox sister Pulcheria, with a nominal
husband, succeeded to the throne; Chrysaphius was burnt, Dioscorus was
disgraced, the exiles were recalled, and the tome of Leo was subscribed
by the Oriental bishops. Yet the pope was disappointed in his favorite
project of a Latin council: he disdained to preside in the Greek synod,
which was speedily assembled at Nice in Bithynia; his legates required
in a peremptory tone the presence of the emperor; and the weary fathers
were transported to Chalcedon under the immediate eye of Marcian and
the senate of Constantinople. A quarter of a mile from the Thracian
Bosphorus, the church of St. Euphemia was built on the summit of a
gentle though lofty ascent: the triple structure was celebrated as a
prodigy of art, and the boundless prospect of the land and sea might
have raised the mind of a sectary to the contemplation of the God of
the universe. Six hundred and thirty bishops were ranged in order in the
nave of the church; but the patriarchs of the East were preceded by the
legates, of whom the third was a simple priest; and the place of honor
was reserved for twenty laymen of consular or senatorian rank. The
gospel was ostentatiously displayed in the centre, but the rule of
faith was defined by the Papal and Imperial ministers, who moderated
the thirteen sessions of the council of Chalcedon. [62] Their partial
interposition silenced the intemperate shouts and execrations, which
degraded the episcopal gravity; but, on the formal accusation of the
legates, Dioscorus was compelled to descend from his throne to the
rank of a criminal, already condemned in the opinion of his judges. The
Orientals, less adverse to Nestorius than to Cyril, accepted the Romans
as their deliverers: Thrace, and Pontus, and Asia, were exasperated
against the murderer of Flavian, and the new patriarchs of
Constantinople and Antioch secured their places by the sacrifice of
their benefactor. The bishops of Palestine, Macedonia, and Greece, were
attached to the faith of Cyril; but in the face of the synod, in the
heat of the battle, the leaders, with their obsequious train, passed
from the right to the left wing, and decided the victory by this
seasonable desertion. Of the seventeen suffragans who sailed from
Alexandria, four were tempted from their allegiance, and the thirteen,
falling prostrate on the ground, implored the mercy of the council, with
sighs and tears, and a pathetic declaration, that, if they yielded, they
should be massacred, on their return to Egypt, by the indignant people.
A tardy repentance was allowed to expiate the guilt or error of the
accomplices of Dioscorus: but their sins were accumulated on his head;
he neither asked nor hoped for pardon, and the moderation of those
who pleaded for a general amnesty was drowned in the prevailing cry of
victory and revenge.

To save the reputation of his late adherents, some personal offences
were skilfully detected; his rash and illegal excommunication of the
pope, and his contumacious refusal (while he was detained a prisoner) to
attend to the summons of the synod. Witnesses were introduced to prove
the special facts of his pride, avarice, and cruelty; and the fathers
heard with abhorrence, that the alms of the church were lavished on
the female dancers, that his palace, and even his bath, was open to the
prostitutes of Alexandria, and that the infamous Pansophia, or Irene,
was publicly entertained as the concubine of the patriarch. [63]

[Footnote 62: The Acts of the Council of Chalcedon (Concil. tom. iv.
p. 761--2071) comprehend those of Ephesus, (p. 890--1189,) which again
comprise the synod of Constantinople under Flavian, (p. 930--1072;)
and at requires some attention to disengage this double involution.
The whole business of Eutyches, Flavian, and Dioscorus, is related by
Evagrius (l. i. c. 9--12, and l. ii. c. 1, 2, 3, 4,) and Liberatus,
(Brev. c. 11, 12, 13, 14.) Once more, and almost for the last time,
I appeal to the diligence of Tillemont, (Mem. Eccles. tom. xv. p.
479-719.) The annals of Baronius and Pagi will accompany me much further
on my long and laborious journey.]

[Footnote 63: (Concil. tom. iv. p. 1276.) A specimen of the wit and
malice of the people is preserved in the Greek Anthology, (l. ii. c.
5, p. 188, edit. Wechel,) although the application was unknown to the
editor Brodaeus. The nameless epigrammatist raises a tolerable pun,
by confounding the episcopal salutation of "Peace be to all!" with
the genuine or corrupted name of the bishop's concubine: I am ignorant
whether the patriarch, who seems to have been a jealous lover, is the
Cimon of a preceding epigram, was viewed with envy and wonder by Priapus
himself.]

For these scandalous offences, Dioscorus was deposed by the synod, and
banished by the emperor; but the purity of his faith was declared in the
presence, and with the tacit approbation, of the fathers. Their prudence
supposed rather than pronounced the heresy of Eutyches, who was never
summoned before their tribunal; and they sat silent and abashed, when
a bold Monophysite casting at their feet a volume of Cyril, challenged
them to anathematize in his person the doctrine of the saint. If we
fairly peruse the acts of Chalcedon as they are recorded by the orthodox
party, [64] we shall find that a great majority of the bishops embraced
the simple unity of Christ; and the ambiguous concession that he
was formed Of or From two natures, might imply either their previous
existence, or their subsequent confusion, or some dangerous interval
between the conception of the man and the assumption of the God.
The Roman theology, more positive and precise, adopted the term most
offensive to the ears of the Egyptians, that Christ existed In two
natures; and this momentous particle [65] (which the memory, rather than
the understanding, must retain) had almost produced a schism among
the Catholic bishops. The tome of Leo had been respectfully, perhaps
sincerely, subscribed; but they protested, in two successive debates,
that it was neither expedient nor lawful to transgress the sacred
landmarks which had been fixed at Nice, Constantinople, and Ephesus,
according to the rule of Scripture and tradition. At length they yielded
to the importunities of their masters; but their infallible decree,
after it had been ratified with deliberate votes and vehement
acclamations, was overturned in the next session by the opposition of
the legates and their Oriental friends. It was in vain that a multitude
of episcopal voices repeated in chorus, "The definition of the fathers
is orthodox and immutable! The heretics are now discovered! Anathema
to the Nestorians! Let them depart from the synod! Let them repair to
Rome." [66] The legates threatened, the emperor was absolute, and a
committee of eighteen bishops prepared a new decree, which was imposed
on the reluctant assembly. In the name of the fourth general council,
the Christ in one person, but in two natures, was announced to the
Catholic world: an invisible line was drawn between the heresy of
Apollinaris and the faith of St. Cyril; and the road to paradise,
a bridge as sharp as a razor, was suspended over the abyss by the
master-hand of the theological artist. During ten centuries of blindness
and servitude, Europe received her religious opinions from the oracle of
the Vatican; and the same doctrine, already varnished with the rust of
antiquity, was admitted without dispute into the creed of the reformers,
who disclaimed the supremacy of the Roman pontiff. The synod of
Chalcedon still triumphs in the Protestant churches; but the ferment of
controversy has subsided, and the most pious Christians of the present
day are ignorant, or careless, of their own belief concerning the
mystery of the incarnation.

[Footnote 64: Those who reverence the infallibility of synods, may try
to ascertain their sense. The leading bishops were attended by partial
or careless scribes, who dispersed their copies round the world. Our
Greek Mss. are sullied with the false and prescribed reading of (Concil.
tom. iii. p. 1460:) the authentic translation of Pope Leo I. does not
seem to have been executed, and the old Latin versions materially differ
from the present Vulgate, which was revised (A.D. 550) by Rusticus,
a Roman priest, from the best Mss. at Constantinople, (Ducange, C. P.
Christiana, l. iv. p. 151,) a famous monastery of Latins, Greeks, and
Syrians. See Concil. tom. iv. p. 1959--2049, and Pagi, Critica, tom. ii.
p. 326, &c.]

[Footnote 65: It is darkly represented in the microscope of Petavius,
(tom. v. l. iii. c. 5;) yet the subtle theologian is himself afraid--ne
quis fortasse supervacaneam, et nimis anxiam putet hujusmodi vocularum
inquisitionem, et ab instituti theologici gravitate alienam, (p. 124.)]

[Footnote 66: (Concil. tom. iv. p. 1449.) Evagrius and Liberatus present
only the placid face of the synod, and discreetly slide over these
embers, suppositos cineri doloso.]

Far different was the temper of the Greeks and Egyptians under the
orthodox reigns of Leo and Marcian. Those pious emperors enforced with
arms and edicts the symbol of their faith; [67] and it was declared by
the conscience or honor of five hundred bishops, that the decrees of
the synod of Chalcedon might be lawfully supported, even with blood.
The Catholics observed with satisfaction, that the same synod was odious
both to the Nestorians and the Monophysites; [68] but the Nestorians
were less angry, or less powerful, and the East was distracted by
the obstinate and sanguinary zeal of the Monophysites. Jerusalem was
occupied by an army of monks; in the name of the one incarnate nature,
they pillaged, they burnt, they murdered; the sepulchre of Christ was
defiled with blood; and the gates of the city were guarded in tumultuous
rebellion against the troops of the emperor. After the disgrace and
exile of Dioscorus, the Egyptians still regretted their spiritual
father; and detested the usurpation of his successor, who was introduced
by the fathers of Chalcedon. The throne of Proterius was supported by a
guard of two thousand soldiers: he waged a five years' war against the
people of Alexandria; and on the first intelligence of the death of
Marcian, he became the victim of their zeal. On the third day before
the festival of Easter, the patriarch was besieged in the cathedral,
and murdered in the baptistery. The remains of his mangled corpse were
delivered to the flames, and his ashes to the wind; and the deed was
inspired by the vision of a pretended angel: an ambitious monk, who,
under the name of Timothy the Cat, [69] succeeded to the place and
opinions of Dioscorus. This deadly superstition was inflamed, on either
side, by the principle and the practice of retaliation: in the pursuit
of a metaphysical quarrel, many thousands [70] were slain, and the
Christians of every degree were deprived of the substantial enjoyments
of social life, and of the invisible gifts of baptism and the holy
communion. Perhaps an extravagant fable of the times may conceal an
allegorical picture of these fanatics, who tortured each other and
themselves. "Under the consulship of Venantius and Celer," says a grave
bishop, "the people of Alexandria, and all Egypt, were seized with a
strange and diabolical frenzy: great and small, slaves and freedmen,
monks and clergy, the natives of the land, who opposed the synod of
Chalcedon, lost their speech and reason, barked like dogs, and tore,
with their own teeth the flesh from their hands and arms." [71]

[Footnote 67: See, in the Appendix to the Acts of Chalcedon, the
confirmation of the Synod by Marcian, (Concil. tom. iv. p. 1781, 1783;)
his letters to the monks of Alexandria, (p. 1791,) of Mount Sinai,
(p. 1793,) of Jerusalem and Palestine, (p. 1798;) his laws against the
Eutychians, (p. 1809, 1811, 1831;) the correspondence of Leo with the
provincial synods on the revolution of Alexandria, (p. 1835--1930.)]

[Footnote 68: Photius (or rather Eulogius of Alexandria) confesses, in a
fine passage, the specious color of this double charge against Pope Leo
and his synod of Chalcedon, (Bibliot. cod. ccxxv. p. 768.) He waged a
double war against the enemies of the church, and wounded either
foe with the darts of his adversary. Against Nestorius he seemed to
introduce Monophysites; against Eutyches he appeared to countenance the
Nestorians. The apologist claims a charitable interpretation for the
saints: if the same had been extended to the heretics, the sound of the
controversy would have been lost in the air]

[Footnote 69: From his nocturnal expeditions. In darkness and disguise
he crept round the cells of the monastery, and whispered the revelation
to his slumbering brethren, (Theodor. Lector. l. i.)]

[Footnote 70: Such is the hyperbolic language of the Henoticon.]

[Footnote 71: See the Chronicle of Victor Tunnunensis, in the Lectiones
Antiquae of Canisius, republished by Basnage, tom. 326.]

The disorders of thirty years at length produced the famous Henoticon
[72] of the emperor Zeno, which in his reign, and in that of Anastasius,
was signed by all the bishops of the East, under the penalty of
degradation and exile, if they rejected or infringed this salutary and
fundamental law. The clergy may smile or groan at the presumption of
a layman who defines the articles of faith; yet if he stoops to the
humiliating task, his mind is less infected by prejudice or interest,
and the authority of the magistrate can only be maintained by the
concord of the people. It is in ecclesiastical story, that Zeno appears
least contemptible; and I am not able to discern any Manichaean or
Eutychian guilt in the generous saying of Anastasius. That it was
unworthy of an emperor to persecute the worshippers of Christ and the
citizens of Rome. The Henoticon was most pleasing to the Egyptians; yet
the smallest blemish has not been described by the jealous, and even
jaundiced eyes of our orthodox schoolmen, and it accurately represents
the Catholic faith of the incarnation, without adopting or disclaiming
the peculiar terms of tenets of the hostile sects. A solemn anathema is
pronounced against Nestorius and Eutyches; against all heretics by
whom Christ is divided, or confounded, or reduced to a phantom. Without
defining the number or the article of the word nature, the pure system
of St. Cyril, the faith of Nice, Constantinople, and Ephesus, is
respectfully confirmed; but, instead of bowing at the name of the
fourth council, the subject is dismissed by the censure of all
contrary doctrines, if any such have been taught either elsewhere or at
Chalcedon. Under this ambiguous expression, the friends and the enemies
of the last synod might unite in a silent embrace. The most reasonable
Christians acquiesced in this mode of toleration; but their reason was
feeble and inconstant, and their obedience was despised as timid and
servile by the vehement spirit of their brethren. On a subject which
engrossed the thoughts and discourses of men, it was difficult to
preserve an exact neutrality; a book, a sermon, a prayer, rekindled the
flame of controversy; and the bonds of communion were alternately broken
and renewed by the private animosity of the bishops. The space between
Nestorius and Eutyches was filled by a thousand shades of language and
opinion; the acephali [73] of Egypt, and the Roman pontiffs, of equal
valor, though of unequal strength, may be found at the two extremities
of the theological scale. The acephali, without a king or a bishop, were
separated above three hundred years from the patriarchs of Alexandria,
who had accepted the communion of Constantinople, without exacting
a formal condemnation of the synod of Chalcedon. For accepting the
communion of Alexandria, without a formal approbation of the same synod,
the patriarchs of Constantinople were anathematized by the popes. Their
inflexible despotism involved the most orthodox of the Greek churches
in this spiritual contagion, denied or doubted the validity of their
sacraments, [74] and fomented, thirty-five years, the schism of the
East and West, till they finally abolished the memory of four Byzantine
pontiffs, who had dared to oppose the supremacy of St. Peter. [75]
Before that period, the precarious truce of Constantinople and Egypt
had been violated by the zeal of the rival prelates. Macedonius, who was
suspected of the Nestorian heresy, asserted, in disgrace and exile, the
synod of Chalcedon, while the successor of Cyril would have purchased
its overthrow with a bribe of two thousand pounds of gold. [Footnote
72: The Henoticon is transcribed by Evagrius, (l. iii. c. 13,) and
translated by Liberatus, (Brev. c. 18.) Pagi (Critica, tom. ii. p. 411)
and (Bibliot. Orient. tom. i. p. 343) are satisfied that it is free from
heresy; but Petavius (Dogmat. Theolog. tom. v. l. i. c. 13, p. 40) most
unaccountably affirms Chalcedonensem ascivit. An adversary would prove
that he had never read the Henoticon.]

[Footnote 73: See Renaudot, (Hist. Patriarch. Alex. p. 123, 131, 145,
195, 247.) They were reconciled by the care of Mark I. (A.D. 799--819;)
he promoted their chiefs to the bishoprics of Athribis and Talba,
(perhaps Tava. See D'Anville, p. 82,) and supplied the sacraments, which
had failed for want of an episcopal ordination.]

[Footnote 74: De his quos baptizavit, quos ordinavit Acacius, majorum
traditione confectam et veram, praecipue religiosae solicitudini
congruam praebemus sine difficultate medicinam, (Galacius, in epist. i.
ad Euphemium, Concil. tom. v. 286.) The offer of a medicine proves the
disease, and numbers must have perished before the arrival of the Roman
physician. Tillemont himself (Mem. Eccles. tom. xvi. p. 372, 642, &c.)
is shocked at the proud, uncharitable temper of the popes; they are now
glad, says he, to invoke St. Flavian of Antioch, St. Elias of Jerusalem,
&c., to whom they refused communion whilst upon earth. But Cardinal
Baronius is firm and hard as the rock of St. Peter.]

[Footnote 75: Their names were erased from the diptych of the church: ex
venerabili diptycho, in quo piae memoriae transitum ad coelum habentium
episcoporum vocabula continentur, (Concil. tom. iv. p. 1846.) This
ecclesiastical record was therefore equivalent to the book of life.]

In the fever of the times, the sense, or rather the sound of a syllable,
was sufficient to disturb the peace of an empire. The Trisagion [76]
(thrice holy,) "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts!" is supposed,
by the Greeks, to be the identical hymn which the angels and cherubim
eternally repeat before the throne of God, and which, about the middle
of the fifth century, was miraculously revealed to the church of
Constantinople. The devotion of Antioch soon added, "who was crucified
for us!" and this grateful address, either to Christ alone, or to the
whole Trinity, may be justified by the rules of theology, and has been
gradually adopted by the Catholics of the East and West. But it had been
imagined by a Monophysite bishop; [77] the gift of an enemy was at first
rejected as a dire and dangerous blasphemy, and the rash innovation had
nearly cost the emperor Anastasius his throne and his life. [78] The
people of Constantinople was devoid of any rational principles of
freedom; but they held, as a lawful cause of rebellion, the color of
a livery in the races, or the color of a mystery in the schools. The
Trisagion, with and without this obnoxious addition, was chanted in the
cathedral by two adverse choirs, and when their lungs were exhausted,
they had recourse to the more solid arguments of sticks and stones; the
aggressors were punished by the emperor, and defended by the patriarch;
and the crown and mitre were staked on the event of this momentous
quarrel. The streets were instantly crowded with innumerable swarms
of men, women, and children; the legions of monks, in regular array,
marched, and shouted, and fought at their head, "Christians! this is the
day of martyrdom: let us not desert our spiritual father; anathema to
the Manichaean tyrant! he is unworthy to reign." Such was the Catholic
cry; and the galleys of Anastasius lay upon their oars before the
palace, till the patriarch had pardoned his penitent, and hushed the
waves of the troubled multitude. The triumph of Macedonius was checked
by a speedy exile; but the zeal of his flock was again exasperated by
the same question, "Whether one of the Trinity had been crucified?" On
this momentous occasion, the blue and green factions of Constantinople
suspended their discord, and the civil and military powers were
annihilated in their presence. The keys of the city, and the standards
of the guards, were deposited in the forum of Constantine, the principal
station and camp of the faithful. Day and night they were incessantly
busied either in singing hymns to the honor of their God, or in
pillaging and murdering the servants of their prince. The head of his
favorite monk, the friend, as they styled him, of the enemy of the Holy
Trinity, was borne aloft on a spear; and the firebrands, which had
been darted against heretical structures, diffused the undistinguishing
flames over the most orthodox buildings. The statues of the emperor were
broken, and his person was concealed in a suburb, till, at the end of
three days, he dared to implore the mercy of his subjects. Without his
diadem, and in the posture of a suppliant, Anastasius appeared on the
throne of the circus. The Catholics, before his face, rehearsed their
genuine Trisagion; they exulted in the offer, which he proclaimed by
the voice of a herald, of abdicating the purple; they listened to the
admonition, that, since all could not reign, they should previously
agree in the choice of a sovereign; and they accepted the blood of two
unpopular ministers, whom their master, without hesitation, condemned to
the lions. These furious but transient seditions were encouraged by the
success of Vitalian, who, with an army of Huns and Bulgarians, for
the most part idolaters, declared himself the champion of the Catholic
faith. In this pious rebellion he depopulated Thrace, besieged
Constantinople, exterminated sixty-five thousand of his
fellow-Christians, till he obtained the recall of the bishops, the
satisfaction of the pope, and the establishment of the council
of Chalcedon, an orthodox treaty, reluctantly signed by the dying
Anastasius, and more faithfully performed by the uncle of Justinian. And
such was the event of the first of the religious wars which have been
waged in the name and by the disciples, of the God of peace. [79]

[Footnote 76: Petavius (Dogmat. Theolog. tom. v. l. v. c. 2, 3, 4,
p. 217-225) and Tillemont (Mem. Eccles. tom. xiv. p. 713, &c., 799)
represent the history and doctrine of the Trisagion. In the twelve
centuries between Isaiah and St. Proculs's boy, who was taken up into
heaven before the bishop and people of Constantinople, the song was
considerably improved. The boy heard the angels sing, "Holy God! Holy
strong! Holy immortal!"]

exercised in his monastery,) patriarch of Antioch. His tedious story is
discussed in the Annals of Pagi (A.D. 477--490) and a dissertation of M.
de Valois at the end of his Evagrius.]

[Footnote 78: The troubles under the reign of Anastasius must be
gathered from the Chronicles of Victor, Marcellinus, and Theophanes. As
the last was not published in the time of Baronius, his critic Pagi is
more copious, as well as more correct.]

[Footnote 79: The general history, from the council of Chalcedon to
the death of Anastasius, may be found in the Breviary of Liberatus, (c.
14--19,) the iid and iiid books of Evagrius, the abstract of the two
books of Theodore the Reader, the Acts of the Synods, and the Epistles
of the Pope, (Concil. tom. v.) The series is continued with some
disorder in the xvth and xvith tomes of the Memoires Ecclesiastiques
of Tillemont. And here I must take leave forever of that incomparable
guide--whose bigotry is overbalanced by the merits of erudition,
diligence, veracity, and scrupulous minuteness. He was prevented by
death from completing, as he designed, the vith century of the church
and empire.]
