During the last years of Justinian, his infirm mind was devoted to
heavenly contemplation, and he neglected the business of the lower
world. His subjects were impatient of the long continuance of his life
and reign: yet all who were capable of reflection apprehended the moment
of his death, which might involve the capital in tumult, and the empire
in civil war. Seven nephews [1] of the childless monarch, the sons or
grandsons of his brother and sister, had been educated in the splendor
of a princely fortune; they had been shown in high commands to the
provinces and armies; their characters were known, their followers were
zealous, and, as the jealousy of age postponed the declaration of a
successor, they might expect with equal hopes the inheritance of their
uncle. He expired in his palace, after a reign of thirty-eight years;
and the decisive opportunity was embraced by the friends of Justin,
the son of Vigilantia. [2] At the hour of midnight, his domestics
were awakened by an importunate crowd, who thundered at his door, and
obtained admittance by revealing themselves to be the principal members
of the senate. These welcome deputies announced the recent and momentous
secret of the emperor's decease; reported, or perhaps invented, his
dying choice of the best beloved and most deserving of his nephews,
and conjured Justin to prevent the disorders of the multitude, if they
should perceive, with the return of light, that they were left without a
master. After composing his countenance to surprise, sorrow, and decent
modesty, Justin, by the advice of his wife Sophia, submitted to the
authority of the senate. He was conducted with speed and silence to
the palace; the guards saluted their new sovereign; and the martial and
religious rites of his coronation were diligently accomplished. By the
hands of the proper officers he was invested with the Imperial garments,
the red buskins, white tunic, and purple robe.

A fortunate soldier, whom he instantly promoted to the rank of tribune,
encircled his neck with a military collar; four robust youths exalted
him on a shield; he stood firm and erect to receive the adoration of
his subjects; and their choice was sanctified by the benediction of the
patriarch, who imposed the diadem on the head of an orthodox prince. The
hippodrome was already filled with innumerable multitudes; and no sooner
did the emperor appear on his throne, than the voices of the blue and
the green factions were confounded in the same loyal acclamations.
In the speeches which Justin addressed to the senate and people, he
promised to correct the abuses which had disgraced the age of his
predecessor, displayed the maxims of a just and beneficent government,
and declared that, on the approaching calends of January, [3] he would
revive in his own person the name and liberty of a Roman consul. The
immediate discharge of his uncle's debts exhibited a solid pledge of
his faith and generosity: a train of porters, laden with bags of gold,
advanced into the midst of the hippodrome, and the hopeless creditors
of Justinian accepted this equitable payment as a voluntary gift. Before
the end of three years, his example was imitated and surpassed by the
empress Sophia, who delivered many indigent citizens from the weight of
debt and usury: an act of benevolence the best entitled to gratitude,
since it relieves the most intolerable distress; but in which the bounty
of a prince is the most liable to be abused by the claims of prodigality
and fraud. [4]

Byzantine of Ducange, p. 89--101. The devout civilians, Ludewig (in
Vit. Justinian. p. 131) and Heineccius (Hist. Juris. Roman. p. 374) have
since illustrated the genealogy of their favorite prince.]

[Footnote 2: In the story of Justin's elevation I have translated into
simple and concise prose the eight hundred verses of the two first books
of Corippus, de Laudibus Justini Appendix Hist. Byzant. p. 401--416 Rome

[Footnote 3: It is surprising how Pagi (Critica. in Annal. Baron. tom.
ii. p 639) could be tempted by any chronicles to contradict the plain
and decisive text of Corippus, (vicina dona, l. ii. 354, vicina dies, l.
iv. 1,) and to postpone, till A.D. 567, the consulship of Justin.]

are mere transcribers, it is superfluous to allege their testimony.]

On the seventh day of his reign, Justin gave audience to the ambassadors
of the Avars, and the scene was decorated to impress the Barbarians with
astonishment, veneration, and terror. From the palace gate, the spacious
courts and long porticos were lined with the lofty crests and gilt
bucklers of the guards, who presented their spears and axes with more
confidence than they would have shown in a field of battle. The officers
who exercised the power, or attended the person, of the prince, were
attired in their richest habits, and arranged according to the military
and civil order of the hierarchy. When the veil of the sanctuary was
withdrawn, the ambassadors beheld the emperor of the East on his throne,
beneath a canopy, or dome, which was supported by four columns, and
crowned with a winged figure of Victory. In the first emotions of
surprise, they submitted to the servile adoration of the Byzantine
court; but as soon as they rose from the ground, Targetius, the chief
of the embassy, expressed the freedom and pride of a Barbarian. He
extolled, by the tongue of his interpreter, the greatness of the chagan,
by whose clemency the kingdoms of the South were permitted to exist,
whose victorious subjects had traversed the frozen rivers of Scythia,
and who now covered the banks of the Danube with innumerable tents.
The late emperor had cultivated, with annual and costly gifts, the
friendship of a grateful monarch, and the enemies of Rome had respected
the allies of the Avars. The same prudence would instruct the nephew of
Justinian to imitate the liberality of his uncle, and to purchase the
blessings of peace from an invincible people, who delighted and excelled
in the exercise of war. The reply of the emperor was delivered in the
same strain of haughty defiance, and he derived his confidence from
the God of the Christians, the ancient glory of Rome, and the recent
triumphs of Justinian. "The empire," said he, "abounds with men and
horses, and arms sufficient to defend our frontiers, and to chastise
the Barbarians. You offer aid, you threaten hostilities: we despise your
enmity and your aid. The conquerors of the Avars solicit our alliance;
shall we dread their fugitives and exiles? [5] The bounty of our uncle
was granted to your misery, to your humble prayers. From us you shall
receive a more important obligation, the knowledge of your own weakness.
Retire from our presence; the lives of ambassadors are safe; and, if
you return to implore our pardon, perhaps you will taste of our
benevolence." [6] On the report of his ambassadors, the chagan was
awed by the apparent firmness of a Roman emperor of whose character and
resources he was ignorant. Instead of executing his threats against
the Eastern empire, he marched into the poor and savage countries of
Germany, which were subject to the dominion of the Franks. After two
doubtful battles, he consented to retire, and the Austrasian king
relieve the distress of his camp with an immediate supply of corn and
cattle. [7] Such repeated disappointments had chilled the spirit of
the Avars, and their power would have dissolved away in the Sarmatian
desert, if the alliance of Alboin, king of the Lombards, had not given
a new object to their arms, and a lasting settlement to their wearied
fortunes.

[Footnote 5: Corippus, l. iii. 390. The unquestionable sense relates
to the Turks, the conquerors of the Avars; but the word scultor has no
apparent meaning, and the sole Ms. of Corippus, from whence the first
edition (1581, apud Plantin) was printed, is no longer visible. The
last editor, Foggini of Rome, has inserted the conjectural emendation
of soldan: but the proofs of Ducange, (Joinville, Dissert. xvi. p.
238--240,) for the early use of this title among the Turks and
Persians, are weak or ambiguous. And I must incline to the authority of
D'Herbelot, (Bibliotheque Orient. p. 825,) who ascribes the word to the
Arabic and Chaldaean tongues, and the date to the beginning of the xith
century, when it was bestowed by the khalif of Bagdad on Mahmud, prince
of Gazna, and conqueror of India.]

[Footnote 6: For these characteristic speeches, compare the verse
of Corippus (l. iii. 251--401) with the prose of Menander, (Excerpt.
Legation. p 102, 103.) Their diversity proves that they did not copy
each other their resemblance, that they drew from a common original.]

[Footnote 7: For the Austrasian war, see Menander (Excerpt. Legat. p.
110,) Gregory of Tours, (Hist. Franc. l. iv. c 29,) and Paul the deacon,
(de Gest. Langobard. l. ii. c. 10.)]

While Alboin served under his father's standard, he encountered in
battle, and transpierced with his lance, the rival prince of the
Gepidae. The Lombards, who applauded such early prowess, requested his
father, with unanimous acclamations, that the heroic youth, who had
shared the dangers of the field, might be admitted to the feast of
victory. "You are not unmindful," replied the inflexible Audoin, "of the
wise customs of our ancestors. Whatever may be his merit, a prince is
incapable of sitting at table with his father till he has received his
arms from a foreign and royal hand." Alboin bowed with reverence to
the institutions of his country, selected forty companions, and boldly
visited the court of Turisund, king of the Gepidae, who embraced and
entertained, according to the laws of hospitality, the murderer of his
son. At the banquet, whilst Alboin occupied the seat of the youth whom
he had slain, a tender remembrance arose in the mind of Turisund. "How
dear is that place! how hateful is that person!" were the words that
escaped, with a sigh, from the indignant father. His grief exasperated
the national resentment of the Gepidae; and Cunimund, his surviving
son, was provoked by wine, or fraternal affection, to the desire of
vengeance. "The Lombards," said the rude Barbarian, "resemble, in figure
and in smell, the mares of our Sarmatian plains." And this insult was
a coarse allusion to the white bands which enveloped their legs. "Add
another resemblance," replied an audacious Lombard; "you have felt how
strongly they kick. Visit the plain of Asfield, and seek for the bones
of thy brother: they are mingled with those of the vilest animals."
The Gepidae, a nation of warriors, started from their seats, and the
fearless Alboin, with his forty companions, laid their hands on their
swords. The tumult was appeased by the venerable interposition of
Turisund. He saved his own honor, and the life of his guest; and, after
the solemn rites of investiture, dismissed the stranger in the bloody
arms of his son; the gift of a weeping parent. Alboin returned in
triumph; and the Lombards, who celebrated his matchless intrepidity,
were compelled to praise the virtues of an enemy. [8] In this
extraordinary visit he had probably seen the daughter of Cunimund, who
soon after ascended the throne of the Gepidae. Her name was Rosamond,
an appellation expressive of female beauty, and which our own history or
romance has consecrated to amorous tales. The king of the Lombards (the
father of Alboin no longer lived) was contracted to the granddaughter of
Clovis; but the restraints of faith and policy soon yielded to the hope
of possessing the fair Rosamond, and of insulting her family and nation.
The arts of persuasion were tried without success; and the impatient
lover, by force and stratagem, obtained the object of his desires. War
was the consequence which he foresaw and solicited; but the Lombards
could not long withstand the furious assault of the Gepidae, who were
sustained by a Roman army. And, as the offer of marriage was rejected
with contempt, Alboin was compelled to relinquish his prey, and to
partake of the disgrace which he had inflicted on the house of Cunimund.

l. i. c. 23, 24. His pictures of national manners, though rudely
sketched are more lively and faithful than those of Bede, or Gregory of
Tours]

[Footnote 9: The story is told by an impostor, (Theophylact. Simocat.
l. vi. c. 10;) but he had art enough to build his fictions on public and
notorious facts.]

When a public quarrel is envenomed by private injuries, a blow that is
not mortal or decisive can be productive only of a short truce,
which allows the unsuccessful combatant to sharpen his arms for a
new encounter. The strength of Alboin had been found unequal to the
gratification of his love, ambition, and revenge: he condescended to
implore the formidable aid of the chagan; and the arguments that he
employed are expressive of the art and policy of the Barbarians. In
the attack of the Gepidae, he had been prompted by the just desire
of extirpating a people whom their alliance with the Roman empire had
rendered the common enemies of the nations, and the personal adversaries
of the chagan. If the forces of the Avars and the Lombards should
unite in this glorious quarrel, the victory was secure, and the reward
inestimable: the Danube, the Hebrus, Italy, and Constantinople, would
be exposed, without a barrier, to their invincible arms. But, if they
hesitated or delayed to prevent the malice of the Romans, the same
spirit which had insulted would pursue the Avars to the extremity of the
earth. These specious reasons were heard by the chagan with coldness and
disdain: he detained the Lombard ambassadors in his camp, protracted the
negotiation, and by turns alleged his want of inclination, or his
want of ability, to undertake this important enterprise. At length he
signified the ultimate price of his alliance, that the Lombards should
immediately present him with a tithe of their cattle; that the spoils
and captives should be equally divided; but that the lands of the
Gepidae should become the sole patrimony of the Avars. Such hard
conditions were eagerly accepted by the passions of Alboin; and, as
the Romans were dissatisfied with the ingratitude and perfidy of the
Gepidae, Justin abandoned that incorrigible people to their fate, and
remained the tranquil spectator of this unequal conflict. The despair
of Cunimund was active and dangerous. He was informed that the Avars
had entered his confines; but, on the strong assurance that, after the
defeat of the Lombards, these foreign invaders would easily be repelled,
he rushed forwards to encounter the implacable enemy of his name and
family. But the courage of the Gepidae could secure them no more than an
honorable death. The bravest of the nation fell in the field of battle;
the king of the Lombards contemplated with delight the head of Cunimund;
and his skull was fashioned into a cup to satiate the hatred of the
conqueror, or, perhaps, to comply with the savage custom of his country.
[10] After this victory, no further obstacle could impede the progress
of the confederates, and they faithfully executed the terms of their
agreement. [11] The fair countries of Walachia, Moldavia, Transylvania,
and the other parts of Hungary beyond the Danube, were occupied, without
resistance, by a new colony of Scythians; and the Dacian empire of the
chagans subsisted with splendor above two hundred and thirty years. The
nation of the Gepidae was dissolved; but, in the distribution of
the captives, the slaves of the Avars were less fortunate than the
companions of the Lombards, whose generosity adopted a valiant foe, and
whose freedom was incompatible with cool and deliberate tyranny. One
moiety of the spoil introduced into the camp of Alboin more wealth than
a Barbarian could readily compute. The fair Rosamond was persuaded, or
compelled, to acknowledge the rights of her victorious lover; and the
daughter of Cunimund appeared to forgive those crimes which might be
imputed to her own irresistible charms.

[Footnote 10: It appears from Strabo, Pliny, and Ammianus Marcellinus,
that the same practice was common among the Scythian tribes, (Muratori,
Scriptores Rer. Italic. tom. i. p. 424.) The scalps of North America are
likewise trophies of valor. The skull of Cunimund was preserved above
two hundred years among the Lombards; and Paul himself was one of the
guests to whom Duke Ratchis exhibited this cup on a high festival, (l.
ii. c. 28.)]

The destruction of a mighty kingdom established the fame of Alboin. In
the days of Charlemagne, the Bavarians, the Saxons, and the other tribes
of the Teutonic language, still repeated the songs which described the
heroic virtues, the valor, liberality, and fortune of the king of the
Lombards. [12] But his ambition was yet unsatisfied; and the conqueror
of the Gepidae turned his eyes from the Danube to the richer banks
of the Po, and the Tyber. Fifteen years had not elapsed, since his
subjects, the confederates of Narses, had visited the pleasant climate
of Italy: the mountains, the rivers, the highways, were familiar to
their memory: the report of their success, perhaps the view of their
spoils, had kindled in the rising generation the flame of emulation and
enterprise. Their hopes were encouraged by the spirit and eloquence of
Alboin: and it is affirmed, that he spoke to their senses, by producing
at the royal feast, the fairest and most exquisite fruits that grew
spontaneously in the garden of the world. No sooner had he erected his
standard, than the native strength of the Lombard was multiplied by
the adventurous youth of Germany and Scythia. The robust peasantry of
Noricum and Pannonia had resumed the manners of Barbarians; and the
names of the Gepidae, Bulgarians, Sarmatians, and Bavarians, may be
distinctly traced in the provinces of Italy. [13] Of the Saxons, the old
allies of the Lombards, twenty thousand warriors, with their wives and
children, accepted the invitation of Alboin. Their bravery contributed
to his success; but the accession or the absence of their numbers was
not sensibly felt in the magnitude of his host. Every mode of religion
was freely practised by its respective votaries. The king of the
Lombards had been educated in the Arian heresy; but the Catholics, in
their public worship, were allowed to pray for his conversion; while the
more stubborn Barbarians sacrificed a she-goat, or perhaps a captive,
to the gods of their fathers. [14] The Lombards, and their confederates,
were united by their common attachment to a chief, who excelled in all
the virtues and vices of a savage hero; and the vigilance of Alboin
provided an ample magazine of offensive and defensive arms for the use
of the expedition. The portable wealth of the Lombards attended the
march: their lands they cheerfully relinquished to the Avars, on the
solemn promise, which was made and accepted without a smile, that if
they failed in the conquest of Italy, these voluntary exiles should be
reinstated in their former possessions.

the victim are the same.]

They might have failed, if Narses had been the antagonist of the
Lombards; and the veteran warriors, the associates of his Gothic
victory, would have encountered with reluctance an enemy whom they
dreaded and esteemed. But the weakness of the Byzantine court was
subservient to the Barbarian cause; and it was for the ruin of Italy,
that the emperor once listened to the complaints of his subjects. The
virtues of Narses were stained with avarice; and, in his provincial
reign of fifteen years, he accumulated a treasure of gold and silver
which surpassed the modesty of a private fortune. His government was
oppressive or unpopular, and the general discontent was expressed with
freedom by the deputies of Rome. Before the throne of Justinian they
boldly declared, that their Gothic servitude had been more tolerable
than the despotism of a Greek eunuch; and that, unless their tyrant were
instantly removed, they would consult their own happiness in the choice
of a master. The apprehension of a revolt was urged by the voice of
envy and detraction, which had so recently triumphed over the merit
of Belisarius. A new exarch, Longinus, was appointed to supersede the
conqueror of Italy, and the base motives of his recall were revealed in
the insulting mandate of the empress Sophia, "that he should leave to
men the exercise of arms, and return to his proper station among the
maidens of the palace, where a distaff should be again placed in the
hand of the eunuch." "I will spin her such a thread as she shall not
easily unravel!" is said to have been the reply which indignation and
conscious virtue extorted from the hero. Instead of attending, a slave
and a victim, at the gate of the Byzantine palace, he retired to Naples,
from whence (if any credit is due to the belief of the times) Narses
invited the Lombards to chastise the ingratitude of the prince and
people. [15] But the passions of the people are furious and changeable,
and the Romans soon recollected the merits, or dreaded the resentment,
of their victorious general. By the mediation of the pope, who undertook
a special pilgrimage to Naples, their repentance was accepted; and
Narses, assuming a milder aspect and a more dutiful language, consented
to fix his residence in the Capitol. His death, [16] though in the
extreme period of old age, was unseasonable and premature, since his
genius alone could have repaired the last and fatal error of his life.
The reality, or the suspicion, of a conspiracy disarmed and disunited
the Italians. The soldiers resented the disgrace, and bewailed the loss,
of their general. They were ignorant of their new exarch; and Longinus
was himself ignorant of the state of the army and the province. In the
preceding years Italy had been desolated by pestilence and famine, and
a disaffected people ascribed the calamities of nature to the guilt or
folly of their rulers. [17]

[Footnote 15: The charge of the deacon against Narses (l. ii. c. 5)
may be groundless; but the weak apology of the Cardinal (Baron. Annal
Eccles. A.D. 567, No. 8--12) is rejected by the best critics--Pagi (tom.
ii. p. 639, 640,) Muratori, (Annali d' Italia, tom. v. p. 160--163,) and
the last editors, Horatius Blancus, (Script. Rerum Italic. tom. i. p.
427, 428,) and Philip Argelatus, (Sigon. Opera, tom. ii. p. 11, 12.) The
Narses who assisted at the coronation of Justin (Corippus, l. iii. 221)
is clearly understood to be a different person.]

[Footnote 16: The death of Narses is mentioned by Paul, l. ii. c. 11.
Anastas. in Vit. Johan. iii. p. 43. Agnellus, Liber Pontifical. Raven.
in Script. Rer. Italicarum, tom. ii. part i. p. 114, 124. Yet I cannot
believe with Agnellus that Narses was ninety-five years of age. Is it
probable that all his exploits were performed at fourscore?]

[Footnote 17: The designs of Narses and of the Lombards for the invasion
of Italy are exposed in the last chapter of the first book, and the
seven last chapters of the second book, of Paul the deacon.]

Whatever might be the grounds of his security, Alboin neither expected
nor encountered a Roman army in the field. He ascended the Julian Alps,
and looked down with contempt and desire on the fruitful plains to
which his victory communicated the perpetual appellation of Lombardy.
A faithful chieftain, and a select band, were stationed at Forum Julii,
the modern Friuli, to guard the passes of the mountains. The Lombards
respected the strength of Pavia, and listened to the prayers of the
Trevisans: their slow and heavy multitudes proceeded to occupy the
palace and city of Verona; and Milan, now rising from her ashes, was
invested by the powers of Alboin five months after his departure from
Pannonia. Terror preceded his march: he found every where, or he left,
a dreary solitude; and the pusillanimous Italians presumed, without a
trial, that the stranger was invincible. Escaping to lakes, or rocks,
or morasses, the affrighted crowds concealed some fragments of their
wealth, and delayed the moment of their servitude. Paulinus, the
patriarch of Aquileia, removed his treasures, sacred and profane, to
the Isle of Grado, [18] and his successors were adopted by the infant
republic of Venice, which was continually enriched by the public
calamities. Honoratus, who filled the chair of St. Ambrose, had
credulously accepted the faithless offers of a capitulation; and the
archbishop, with the clergy and nobles of Milan, were driven by the
perfidy of Alboin to seek a refuge in the less accessible ramparts of
Genoa. Along the maritime coast, the courage of the inhabitants was
supported by the facility of supply, the hopes of relief, and the power
of escape; but from the Trentine hills to the gates of Ravenna and Rome
the inland regions of Italy became, without a battle or a siege, the
lasting patrimony of the Lombards. The submission of the people invited
the Barbarian to assume the character of a lawful sovereign, and the
helpless exarch was confined to the office of announcing to the emperor
Justin the rapid and irretrievable loss of his provinces and cities.
[19] One city, which had been diligently fortified by the Goths,
resisted the arms of a new invader; and while Italy was subdued by the
flying detachments of the Lombards, the royal camp was fixed above three
years before the western gate of Ticinum, or Pavia. The same courage
which obtains the esteem of a civilized enemy provokes the fury of a
savage, and the impatient besieger had bound himself by a tremendous
oath, that age, and sex, and dignity, should be confounded in a general
massacre. The aid of famine at length enabled him to execute his bloody
vow; but, as Alboin entered the gate, his horse stumbled, fell, and
could not be raised from the ground. One of his attendants was prompted
by compassion, or piety, to interpret this miraculous sign of the wrath
of Heaven: the conqueror paused and relented; he sheathed his sword, and
peacefully reposing himself in the palace of Theodoric, proclaimed to
the trembling multitude that they should live and obey. Delighted
with the situation of a city which was endeared to his pride by the
difficulty of the purchase, the prince of the Lombards disdained the
ancient glories of Milan; and Pavia, during some ages, was respected as
the capital of the kingdom of Italy. [20]

[Footnote 18: Which from this translation was called New Aquileia,

citizen of the republic, (p. 9, &c.,) but his seat was not removed to
Venice till the year 1450. He is now decorated with titles and honors;
but the genius of the church has bowed to that of the state, and the
government of a Catholic city is strictly Presbyterian. Thomassin,

of Paul, (l. p. 7--10, 12, 14, 25, 26, 27,) the eloquent narrative of

correct and critical review el Muratori, (Annali d' Italia, tom. v. p.
164--180.)]

The reign of the founder was splendid and transient; and, before he
could regulate his new conquests, Alboin fell a sacrifice to domestic
treason and female revenge. In a palace near Verona, which had not
been erected for the Barbarians, he feasted the companions of his arms;
intoxication was the reward of valor, and the king himself was
tempted by appetite, or vanity, to exceed the ordinary measure of
his intemperance. After draining many capacious bowls of Rhaetian or
Falernian wine, he called for the skull of Cunimund, the noblest and
most precious ornament of his sideboard. The cup of victory was accepted
with horrid applause by the circle of the Lombard chiefs. "Fill it again
with wine," exclaimed the inhuman conqueror, "fill it to the brim: carry
this goblet to the queen, and request in my name that she would rejoice
with her father." In an agony of grief and rage, Rosamond had strength
to utter, "Let the will of my lord be obeyed!" and, touching it with her
lips, pronounced a silent imprecation, that the insult should be
washed away in the blood of Alboin. Some indulgence might be due to the
resentment of a daughter, if she had not already violated the duties of
a wife. Implacable in her enmity, or inconstant in her love, the queen
of Italy had stooped from the throne to the arms of a subject, and
Helmichis, the king's armor-bearer, was the secret minister of her
pleasure and revenge. Against the proposal of the murder, he could
no longer urge the scruples of fidelity or gratitude; but Helmichis
trembled when he revolved the danger as well as the guilt, when he
recollected the matchless strength and intrepidity of a warrior whom he
had so often attended in the field of battle. He pressed and obtained,
that one of the bravest champions of the Lombards should be associated
to the enterprise; but no more than a promise of secrecy could be
drawn from the gallant Peredeus, and the mode of seduction employed by
Rosamond betrays her shameless insensibility both to honor and love. She
supplied the place of one of her female attendants who was beloved by
Peredeus, and contrived some excuse for darkness and silence, till
she could inform her companion that he had enjoyed the queen of the
Lombards, and that his own death, or the death of Alboin, must be the
consequence of such treasonable adultery. In this alternative he chose
rather to be the accomplice than the victim of Rosamond, [21] whose
undaunted spirit was incapable of fear or remorse. She expected and
soon found a favorable moment, when the king, oppressed with wine, had
retired from the table to his afternoon slumbers. His faithless spouse
was anxious for his health and repose: the gates of the palace were
shut, the arms removed, the attendants dismissed, and Rosamond, after
lulling him to rest by her tender caresses, unbolted the chamber door,
and urged the reluctant conspirators to the instant execution of the
deed. On the first alarm, the warrior started from his couch: his sword,
which he attempted to draw, had been fastened to the scabbard by the
hand of Rosamond; and a small stool, his only weapon, could not long
protect him from the spears of the assassins. The daughter of Cunimund
smiled in his fall: his body was buried under the staircase of the
palace; and the grateful posterity of the Lombards revered the tomb and
the memory of their victorious leader.

[Footnote 21: The classical reader will recollect the wife and murder of
Candaules, so agreeably told in the first book of Herodotus. The choice
of Gyges, may serve as the excuse of Peredeus; and this soft insinuation
of an odious idea has been imitated by the best writers of antiquity,
(Graevius, ad Ciceron. Orat. pro Miloue c. 10)]
