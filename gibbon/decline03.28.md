## Chapter XXXIV: Attila.--Part I.

     The Character, Conquests, And Court Of Attila, King Of The
     Huns.--Death Of Theodosius The Younger.--Elevation Of
     Marcian To The Empire Of The East.

The Western world was oppressed by the Goths and Vandals, who fled
before the Huns; but the achievements of the Huns themselves were not
adequate to their power and prosperity. Their victorious hordes had
spread from the Volga to the Danube; but the public force was exhausted
by the discord of independent chieftains; their valor was idly consumed
in obscure and predatory excursions; and they often degraded their
national dignity, by condescending, for the hopes of spoil, to enlist
under the banners of their fugitive enemies. In the reign of Attila, [1]
the Huns again became the terror of the world; and I shall now describe
the character and actions of that formidable Barbarian; who alternately
insulted and invaded the East and the West, and urged the rapid downfall
of the Roman empire.

[Footnote 1: The authentic materials for the history of Attila, may be
found in Jornandes (de Rebus Geticis, c. 34-50, p. 668-688, edit. Grot.)
and Priscus (Excerpta de Legationibus, p. 33-76, Paris, 1648.) I have
not seen the Lives of Attila, composed by Juvencus Caelius Calanus
Dalmatinus, in the twelfth century, or by Nicholas Olahus, archbishop
of Gran, in the sixteenth. See Mascou's History of the Germans, ix., and
Maffei Osservazioni Litterarie, tom. i. p. 88, 89. Whatever the modern
Hungarians have added must be fabulous; and they do not seem to have
excelled in the art of fiction. They suppose, that when Attila invaded
Gaul and Italy, married innumerable wives, &c., he was one hundred and
twenty years of age. Thewrocz Chron. c. i. p. 22, in Script. Hunger.
tom. i. p. 76.]

In the tide of emigration which impetuously rolled from the confines
of China to those of Germany, the most powerful and populous tribes may
commonly be found on the verge of the Roman provinces. The accumulated
weight was sustained for a while by artificial barriers; and the easy
condescension of the emperors invited, without satisfying, the insolent
demands of the Barbarians, who had acquired an eager appetite for the
luxuries of civilized life. The Hungarians, who ambitiously insert the
name of Attila among their native kings, may affirm with truth that the
hordes, which were subject to his uncle Roas, or Rugilas, had formed
their encampments within the limits of modern Hungary, [2] in a fertile
country, which liberally supplied the wants of a nation of hunters and
shepherds. In this advantageous situation, Rugilas, and his valiant
brothers, who continually added to their power and reputation, commanded
the alternative of peace or war with the two empires. His alliance with
the Romans of the West was cemented by his personal friendship for the
great Aetius; who was always secure of finding, in the Barbarian camp, a
hospitable reception and a powerful support. At his solicitation, and
in the name of John the usurper, sixty thousand Huns advanced to the
confines of Italy; their march and their retreat were alike expensive to
the state; and the grateful policy of Aetius abandoned the possession of
Pannonia to his faithful confederates. The Romans of the East were
not less apprehensive of the arms of Rugilas, which threatened the
provinces, or even the capital. Some ecclesiastical historians have
destroyed the Barbarians with lightning and pestilence; [3] but
Theodosius was reduced to the more humble expedient of stipulating
an annual payment of three hundred and fifty pounds of gold, and of
disguising this dishonorable tribute by the title of general, which the
king of the Huns condescended to accept. The public tranquillity was
frequently interrupted by the fierce impatience of the Barbarians, and
the perfidious intrigues of the Byzantine court. Four dependent nations,
among whom we may distinguish the Barbarians, disclaimed the sovereignty
of the Huns; and their revolt was encouraged and protected by a Roman
alliance; till the just claims, and formidable power, of Rugilas, were
effectually urged by the voice of Eslaw his ambassador. Peace was the
unanimous wish of the senate: their decree was ratified by the emperor;
and two ambassadors were named, Plinthas, a general of Scythian
extraction, but of consular rank; and the quaestor Epigenes, a wise
and experienced statesman, who was recommended to that office by his
ambitious colleague.

[Footnote 2: Hungary has been successively occupied by three Scythian
colonies. 1. The Huns of Attila; 2. The Abares, in the sixth century;
and, 3. The Turks or Magiars, A.D. 889; the immediate and genuine
ancestors of the modern Hungarians, whose connection with the two former
is extremely faint and remote. The Prodromus and Notitia of Matthew
Belius appear to contain a rich fund of information concerning ancient
and modern Hungary. I have seen the extracts in Bibli otheque Ancienne
et Moderne, tom. xxii. p. 1-51, and Bibliotheque Raisonnee, tom. xvi. p.
127-175. * Note: Mailath (in his Geschichte der Magyaren) considers
the question of the origin of the Magyars as still undecided. The old
Hungarian chronicles unanimously derived them from the Huns of Attila
See note, vol. iv. pp. 341, 342. The later opinion, adopted by Schlozer,
Belnay, and Dankowsky, ascribes them, from their language, to the
Finnish race. Fessler, in his history of Hungary, agrees with Gibbon in
supposing them Turks. Mailath has inserted an ingenious dissertation
of Fejer, which attempts to connect them with the Parthians. Vol. i.
Ammerkungen p. 50--M.]

who always depends on the faith of his ecclesiastical authors,
strenuously contends (Hist. des Emp. tom. vi. p. 136, 607) that the wars
and personages were not the same.]

The death of Rugilas suspended the progress of the treaty. His two
nephews, Attila and Bleda, who succeeded to the throne of their
uncle, consented to a personal interview with the ambassadors of
Constantinople; but as they proudly refused to dismount, the business
was transacted on horseback, in a spacious plain near the city of
Margus, in the Upper Maesia. The kings of the Huns assumed the solid
benefits, as well as the vain honors, of the negotiation. They dictated
the conditions of peace, and each condition was an insult on the majesty
of the empire. Besides the freedom of a safe and plentiful market on the
banks of the Danube, they required that the annual contribution should
be augmented from three hundred and fifty to seven hundred pounds of
gold; that a fine or ransom of eight pieces of gold should be paid for
every Roman captive who had escaped from his Barbarian master; that the
emperor should renounce all treaties and engagements with the enemies of
the Huns; and that all the fugitives who had taken refuge in the court
or provinces of Theodosius, should be delivered to the justice of
their offended sovereign. This justice was rigorously inflicted on
some unfortunate youths of a royal race. They were crucified on the
territories of the empire, by the command of Attila: and as soon as the
king of the Huns had impressed the Romans with the terror of his name,
he indulged them in a short and arbitrary respite, whilst he subdued the
rebellious or independent nations of Scythia and Germany. [4]

[Footnote 4: See Priscus, p. 47, 48, and Hist. de Peuples de l'Europe,
tom. v. i. c. xii, xiii, xiv, xv.]

Attila, the son of Mundzuk, deduced his noble, perhaps his regal,
descent [5] from the ancient Huns, who had formerly contended with
the monarchs of China. His features, according to the observation of
a Gothic historian, bore the stamp of his national origin; and the
portrait of Attila exhibits the genuine deformity of a modern Calmuk;
[6] a large head, a swarthy complexion, small, deep-seated eyes, a flat
nose, a few hairs in the place of a beard, broad shoulders, and a short
square body, of nervous strength, though of a disproportioned form.
The haughty step and demeanor of the king of the Huns expressed the
consciousness of his superiority above the rest of mankind; and he had a
custom of fiercely rolling his eyes, as if he wished to enjoy the terror
which he inspired. Yet this savage hero was not inaccessible to pity;
his suppliant enemies might confide in the assurance of peace or pardon;
and Attila was considered by his subjects as a just and indulgent
master. He delighted in war; but, after he had ascended the throne in a
mature age, his head, rather than his hand, achieved the conquest of the
North; and the fame of an adventurous soldier was usefully exchanged for
that of a prudent and successful general. The effects of personal valor
are so inconsiderable, except in poetry or romance, that victory, even
among Barbarians, must depend on the degree of skill with which the
passions of the multitude are combined and guided for the service of a
single man. The Scythian conquerors, Attila and Zingis, surpassed their
rude countrymen in art rather than in courage; and it may be observed
that the monarchies, both of the Huns and of the Moguls, were erected
by their founders on the basis of popular superstition The miraculous
conception, which fraud and credulity ascribed to the virgin-mother
of Zingis, raised him above the level of human nature; and the naked
prophet, who in the name of the Deity invested him with the empire of
the earth, pointed the valor of the Moguls with irresistible enthusiasm.
[7] The religious arts of Attila were not less skillfully adapted to
the character of his age and country. It was natural enough that the
Scythians should adore, with peculiar devotion, the god of war; but as
they were incapable of forming either an abstract idea, or a corporeal
representation, they worshipped their tutelar deity under the symbol of
an iron cimeter. [8] One of the shepherds of the Huns perceived, that a
heifer, who was grazing, had wounded herself in the foot, and curiously
followed the track of the blood, till he discovered, among the long
grass, the point of an ancient sword, which he dug out of the ground
and presented to Attila. That magnanimous, or rather that artful,
prince accepted, with pious gratitude, this celestial favor; and, as
the rightful possessor of the sword of Mars, asserted his divine and
indefeasible claim to the dominion of the earth. [9] If the rites of
Scythia were practised on this solemn occasion, a lofty altar, or rather
pile of fagots, three hundred yards in length and in breadth, was raised
in a spacious plain; and the sword of Mars was placed erect on the
summit of this rustic altar, which was annually consecrated by the
blood of sheep, horses, and of the hundredth captive. [10] Whether
human sacrifices formed any part of the worship of Attila, or whether he
propitiated the god of war with the victims which he continually offered
in the field of battle, the favorite of Mars soon acquired a sacred
character, which rended his conquests more easy and more permanent;
and the Barbarian princes confessed, in the language of devotion or
flattery, that they could not presume to gaze, with a steady eye, on
the divine majesty of the king of the Huns. [11] His brother Bleda, who
reigned over a considerable part of the nation, was compelled to resign
his sceptre and his life. Yet even this cruel act was attributed to a
supernatural impulse; and the vigor with which Attila wielded the sword
of Mars, convinced the world that it had been reserved alone for his
invincible arm. [12] But the extent of his empire affords the only
remaining evidence of the number and importance of his victories; and
the Scythian monarch, however ignorant of the value of science and
philosophy, might perhaps lament that his illiterate subjects were
destitute of the art which could perpetuate the memory of his exploits.

[Footnote 5: Priscus, p. 39. The modern Hungarians have deduced his
genealogy, which ascends, in the thirty-fifth degree, to Ham, the son
of Noah; yet they are ignorant of his father's real name. (De Guignes,

transcribed from Cassiodorus.]

[Footnote 9: Priscus relates this remarkable story, both in his own
text (p. 65) and in the quotation made by Jornandes, (c. 35, p. 662.) He
might have explained the tradition, or fable, which characterized this
famous sword, and the name, as well as attributes, of the Scythian
deity, whom he has translated into the Mars of the Greeks and Romans.]

pile]

[Footnote 12: The Count de Buat (Hist. des Peuples de l'Europe, tom.
vii. p. 428, 429) attempts to clear Attila from the murder of his
brother; and is almost inclined to reject the concurrent testimony of
Jornandes, and the contemporary Chronicles.]

If a line of separation were drawn between the civilized and the savage
climates of the globe; between the inhabitants of cities, who cultivated
the earth, and the hunters and shepherds, who dwelt in tents, Attila
might aspire to the title of supreme and sole monarch of the Barbarians.
[13] He alone, among the conquerors of ancient and modern times,
united the two mighty kingdoms of Germany and Scythia; and those vague
appellations, when they are applied to his reign, may be understood with
an ample latitude. Thuringia, which stretched beyond its actual limits
as far as the Danube, was in the number of his provinces; he interposed,
with the weight of a powerful neighbor, in the domestic affairs of the
Franks; and one of his lieutenants chastised, and almost exterminated,
the Burgundians of the Rhine.

He subdued the islands of the ocean, the kingdoms of Scandinavia,
encompassed and divided by the waters of the Baltic; and the Huns might
derive a tribute of furs from that northern region, which has been
protected from all other conquerors by the severity of the climate,
and the courage of the natives. Towards the East, it is difficult to
circumscribe the dominion of Attila over the Scythian deserts; yet we
may be assured, that he reigned on the banks of the Volga; that the king
of the Huns was dreaded, not only as a warrior, but as a magician; [14]
that he insulted and vanquished the khan of the formidable Geougen; and
that he sent ambassadors to negotiate an equal alliance with the empire
of China. In the proud review of the nations who acknowledged the
sovereignty of Attila, and who never entertained, during his
lifetime, the thought of a revolt, the Gepidae and the Ostrogoths were
distinguished by their numbers, their bravery, and the personal merits
of their chiefs. The renowned Ardaric, king of the Gepidae, was the
faithful and sagacious counsellor of the monarch, who esteemed his
intrepid genius, whilst he loved the mild and discreet virtues of the
noble Walamir, king of the Ostrogoths. The crowd of vulgar kings, the
leaders of so many martial tribes, who served under the standard of
Attila, were ranged in the submissive order of guards and domestics
round the person of their master. They watched his nod; they trembled at
his frown; and at the first signal of his will, they executed, without
murmur or hesitation, his stern and absolute commands. In time of peace,
the dependent princes, with their national troops, attended the royal
camp in regular succession; but when Attila collected his military
force, he was able to bring into the field an army of five, or,
according to another account, of seven hundred thousand Barbarians. [15]

49, p. 684. Priscus, p. 64, 65. M. de Guignes, by his knowledge of the
Chinese, has acquired (tom. ii. p. 295-301) an adequate idea of the
empire of Attila.]

[Footnote 14: See Hist. des Huns, tom. ii. p. 296. The Geougen believed
that the Huns could excite, at pleasure, storms of wind and rain. This
phenomenon was produced by the stone Gezi; to whose magic power the
loss of a battle was ascribed by the Mahometan Tartars of the fourteenth
century. See Cherefeddin Ali, Hist. de Timur Bec, tom. i. p. 82, 83.]

pride of Attila to his subject kings, and his tragedy opens with these
two ridiculous lines:--

     Ils ne sont pas venus, nos deux rois!  qu'on leur die
     Qu'ils se font trop attendre, et qu'Attila s'ennuie.

The two kings of the Gepidae and the Ostrogoths are profound politicians
and sentimental lovers, and the whole piece exhibits the defects without
the genius, of the poet.]

The ambassadors of the Huns might awaken the attention of Theodosius,
by reminding him that they were his neighbors both in Europe and Asia;
since they touched the Danube on one hand, and reached, with the other,
as far as the Tanais. In the reign of his father Arcadius, a band of
adventurous Huns had ravaged the provinces of the East; from whence they
brought away rich spoils and innumerable captives. [16] They advanced,
by a secret path, along the shores of the Caspian Sea; traversed the
snowy mountains of Armenia; passed the Tigris, the Euphrates, and
the Halys; recruited their weary cavalry with the generous breed of
Cappadocian horses; occupied the hilly country of Cilicia, and disturbed
the festal songs and dances of the citizens of Antioch. Egypt trembled
at their approach; and the monks and pilgrims of the Holy Land prepared
to escaped their fury by a speedy embarkation. The memory of this
invasion was still recent in the minds of the Orientals. The subjects
of Attila might execute, with superior forces, the design which these
adventurers had so boldly attempted; and it soon became the subject of
anxious conjecture, whether the tempest would fall on the dominions of
Rome, or of Persia. Some of the great vassals of the king of the Huns,
who were themselves in the rank of powerful princes, had been sent to
ratify an alliance and society of arms with the emperor, or rather with
the general of the West. They related, during their residence at Rome,
the circumstances of an expedition, which they had lately made into the
East. After passing a desert and a morass, supposed by the Romans to be
the Lake Maeotis, they penetrated through the mountains, and arrived,
at the end of fifteen days' march, on the confines of Media; where they
advanced as far as the unknown cities of Basic and Cursic. [1611]
They encountered the Persian army in the plains of Media and the air,
according to their own expression, was darkened by a cloud of arrows.
But the Huns were obliged to retire before the numbers of the enemy.
Their laborious retreat was effected by a different road; they lost the
greatest part of their booty; and at length returned to the royal camp,
with some knowledge of the country, and an impatient desire of revenge.
In the free conversation of the Imperial ambassadors, who discussed,
at the court of Attila, the character and designs of their formidable
enemy, the ministers of Constantinople expressed their hope, that his
strength might be diverted and employed in a long and doubtful contest
with the princes of the house of Sassan. The more sagacious Italians
admonished their Eastern brethren of the folly and danger of such a
hope; and convinced them, that the Medes and Persians were incapable
of resisting the arms of the Huns; and that the easy and important
acquisition would exalt the pride, as well as power, of the conqueror.
Instead of contenting himself with a moderate contribution, and a
military title, which equalled him only to the generals of Theodosius,
Attila would proceed to impose a disgraceful and intolerable yoke on
the necks of the prostrate and captive Romans, who would then be
encompassed, on all sides, by the empire of the Huns. [17]

[Footnote 1611: Gibbon has made a curious mistake; Basic and Cursic
were the names of the commanders of the Huns. Priscus, edit. Bonn, p.

[Footnote 17: See the original conversation in Priscus, p. 64, 65.]

While the powers of Europe and Asia were solicitous to avert the
impending danger, the alliance of Attila maintained the Vandals in
the possession of Africa. An enterprise had been concerted between the
courts of Ravenna and Constantinople, for the recovery of that valuable
province; and the ports of Sicily were already filled with the military
and naval forces of Theodosius. But the subtle Genseric, who spread his
negotiations round the world, prevented their designs, by exciting the
king of the Huns to invade the Eastern empire; and a trifling incident
soon became the motive, or pretence, of a destructive war. [18] Under
the faith of the treaty of Margus, a free market was held on the
Northern side of the Danube, which was protected by a Roman fortress
surnamed Constantia. A troop of Barbarians violated the commercial
security; killed, or dispersed, the unsuspecting traders; and levelled
the fortress with the ground. The Huns justified this outrage as an
act of reprisal; alleged, that the bishop of Margus had entered their
territories, to discover and steal a secret treasure of their kings;
and sternly demanded the guilty prelate, the sacrilegious spoil, and
the fugitive subjects, who had escaped from the justice of Attila. The
refusal of the Byzantine court was the signal of war; and the Maesians
at first applauded the generous firmness of their sovereign. But they
were soon intimidated by the destruction of Viminiacum and the adjacent
towns; and the people was persuaded to adopt the convenient maxim,
that a private citizen, however innocent or respectable, may be justly
sacrificed to the safety of his country. The bishop of Margus, who did
not possess the spirit of a martyr, resolved to prevent the designs
which he suspected. He boldly treated with the princes of the Huns:
secured, by solemn oaths, his pardon and reward; posted a numerous
detachment of Barbarians, in silent ambush, on the banks of the Danube;
and, at the appointed hour, opened, with his own hand, the gates of his
episcopal city. This advantage, which had been obtained by treachery,
served as a prelude to more honorable and decisive victories. The
Illyrian frontier was covered by a line of castles and fortresses; and
though the greatest part of them consisted only of a single tower,
with a small garrison, they were commonly sufficient to repel, or to
intercept, the inroads of an enemy, who was ignorant of the art, and
impatient of the delay, of a regular siege. But these slight obstacles
were instantly swept away by the inundation of the Huns. [19] They
destroyed, with fire and sword, the populous cities of Sirmium and
Singidunum, of Ratiaria and Marcianopolis, of Naissus and Sardica; where
every circumstance of the discipline of the people, and the construction
of the buildings, had been gradually adapted to the sole purpose of
defence. The whole breadth of Europe, as it extends above five hundred
miles from the Euxine to the Hadriatic, was at once invaded, and
occupied, and desolated, by the myriads of Barbarians whom Attila led
into the field. The public danger and distress could not, however,
provoke Theodosius to interrupt his amusements and devotion, or to
appear in person at the head of the Roman legions. But the troops, which
had been sent against Genseric, were hastily recalled from Sicily; the
garrisons, on the side of Persia, were exhausted; and a military force
was collected in Europe, formidable by their arms and numbers, if the
generals had understood the science of command, and the soldiers the
duty of obedience. The armies of the Eastern empire were vanquished in
three successive engagements; and the progress of Attila may be traced
by the fields of battle.

The two former, on the banks of the Utus, and under the walls of
Marcianopolis, were fought in the extensive plains between the Danube
and Mount Haemus. As the Romans were pressed by a victorious enemy, they
gradually, and unskilfully, retired towards the Chersonesus of Thrace;
and that narrow peninsula, the last extremity of the land, was marked by
their third, and irreparable, defeat. By the destruction of this army,
Attila acquired the indisputable possession of the field. From the
Hellespont to Thermopylae, and the suburbs of Constantinople, he
ravaged, without resistance, and without mercy, the provinces of Thrace
and Macedonia. Heraclea and Hadrianople might, perhaps, escape this
dreadful irruption of the Huns; but the words, the most expressive of
total extirpation and erasure, are applied to the calamities which they
inflicted on seventy cities of the Eastern empire. [20] Theodosius,
his court, and the unwarlike people, were protected by the walls of
Constantinople; but those walls had been shaken by a recent earthquake,
and the fall of fifty-eight towers had opened a large and tremendous
breach. The damage indeed was speedily repaired; but this accident was
aggravated by a superstitious fear, that Heaven itself had delivered
the Imperial city to the shepherds of Scythia, who were strangers to the
laws, the language, and the religion, of the Romans. [21]

[Footnote 18: Priscus, p. 331. His history contained a copious and
elegant account of the war, (Evagrius, l. i. c. 17;) but the extracts
which relate to the embassies are the only parts that have reached our
times. The original work was accessible, however, to the writers from
whom we borrow our imperfect knowledge, Jornandes, Theophanes, Count
Marcellinus, Prosper-Tyro, and the author of the Alexandrian, or
Paschal, Chronicle. M. de Buat (Hist. des Peuples de l'Europe, tom. vii.
c. xv.) has examined the cause, the circumstances, and the duration of
this war; and will not allow it to extend beyond the year 44.]

[Footnote 19: Procopius, de Edificiis, l. 4, c. 5. These fortresses
were afterwards restored, strengthened, and enlarged by the emperor
Justinian, but they were soon destroyed by the Abares, who succeeded to
the power and possessions of the Huns.]

[Footnote 20: Septuaginta civitates (says Prosper-Tyro) depredatione
vastatoe. The language of Count Marcellinus is still more forcible.
Pene totam Europam, invasis excisisque civitatibus atque castellis,
conrasit.]

[Footnote 21: Tillemont (Hist des Empereurs, tom. vi. p. 106, 107) has
paid great attention to this memorable earthquake; which was felt as far
from Constantinople as Antioch and Alexandria, and is celebrated by
all the ecclesiastical writers. In the hands of a popular preacher, an
earthquake is an engine of admirable effect.]

In all their invasions of the civilized empires of the South, the
Scythian shepherds have been uniformly actuated by a savage and
destructive spirit. The laws of war, that restrain the exercise of
national rapine and murder, are founded on two principles of substantial
interest: the knowledge of the permanent benefits which may be obtained
by a moderate use of conquest; and a just apprehension, lest the
desolation which we inflict on the enemy's country may be retaliated on
our own. But these considerations of hope and fear are almost unknown
in the pastoral state of nations. The Huns of Attila may, without
injustice, be compared to the Moguls and Tartars, before their primitive
manners were changed by religion and luxury; and the evidence of
Oriental history may reflect some light on the short and imperfect
annals of Rome. After the Moguls had subdued the northern provinces
of China, it was seriously proposed, not in the hour of victory
and passion, but in calm deliberate council, to exterminate all the
inhabitants of that populous country, that the vacant land might be
converted to the pasture of cattle. The firmness of a Chinese mandarin,
[22] who insinuated some principles of rational policy into the mind of
Zingis, diverted him from the execution of this horrid design. But in
the cities of Asia, which yielded to the Moguls, the inhuman abuse of
the rights of war was exercised with a regular form of discipline, which
may, with equal reason, though not with equal authority, be imputed
to the victorious Huns. The inhabitants, who had submitted to their
discretion, were ordered to evacuate their houses, and to assemble
in some plain adjacent to the city; where a division was made of the
vanquished into three parts. The first class consisted of the soldiers
of the garrison, and of the young men capable of bearing arms; and their
fate was instantly decided they were either enlisted among the Moguls,
or they were massacred on the spot by the troops, who, with pointed
spears and bended bows, had formed a circle round the captive multitude.
The second class, composed of the young and beautiful women, of the
artificers of every rank and profession, and of the more wealthy or
honorable citizens, from whom a private ransom might be expected, was
distributed in equal or proportionable lots. The remainder, whose life
or death was alike useless to the conquerors, were permitted to return
to the city; which, in the mean while, had been stripped of its valuable
furniture; and a tax was imposed on those wretched inhabitants for the
indulgence of breathing their native air. Such was the behavior of the
Moguls, when they were not conscious of any extraordinary rigor. [23]
But the most casual provocation, the slightest motive of caprice
or convenience, often provoked them to involve a whole people in an
indiscriminate massacre; and the ruin of some flourishing cities was
executed with such unrelenting perseverance, that, according to their
own expression, horses might run, without stumbling, over the ground
where they had once stood. The three great capitals of Khorasan, Maru,
Neisabour, and Herat, were destroyed by the armies of Zingis; and the
exact account which was taken of the slain amounted to four millions
three hundred and forty-seven thousand persons. [24] Timur, or
Tamerlane, was educated in a less barbarous age, and in the profession
of the Mahometan religion; yet, if Attila equalled the hostile ravages
of Tamerlane, [25] either the Tartar or the Hun might deserve the
epithet of the Scourge of God. [26]

[Footnote 22: He represented to the emperor of the Moguls that the four
provinces, (Petcheli, Chantong, Chansi, and Leaotong,)which he already
possessed, might annually produce, under a mild administration, 500,000
ounces of silver, 400,000 measures of rice, and 800,000 pieces of silk.
Gaubil, Hist. de la Dynastie des Mongous, p. 58, 59. Yelut chousay (such
was the name of the mandarin) was a wise and virtuous minister, who
saved his country, and civilized the conquerors. * Note: Compare the
life of this remarkable man, translated from the Chinese by M. Abel
Remusat. Nouveaux Melanges Asiatiques, t. ii. p. 64.--M]

[Footnote 23: Particular instances would be endless; but the curious
reader may consult the life of Gengiscan, by Petit de la Croix, the
Histoire des Mongous, and the fifteenth book of the History of the
Huns.]

[Footnote 24: At Maru, 1,300,000; at Herat, 1,600,000; at Neisabour,
1,747,000. D'Herbelot, Bibliotheque Orientale, p. 380, 381. I use the
orthography of D'Anville's maps. It must, however, be allowed, that
the Persians were disposed to exaggerate their losses and the Moguls to
magnify their exploits.]

[Footnote 25: Cherefeddin Ali, his servile panegyrist, would afford us
many horrid examples. In his camp before Delhi, Timour massacred 100,000
Indian prisoners, who had smiled when the army of their countrymen
appeared in sight, (Hist. de Timur Bec, tom. iii. p. 90.) The people of
Ispahan supplied 70,000 human skulls for the structure of several lofty
towers, (id. tom. i. p. 434.) A similar tax was levied on the revolt of
Bagdad, (tom. iii. p. 370;) and the exact account, which Cherefeddin
was not able to procure from the proper officers, is stated by another
historian (Ahmed Arabsiada, tom. ii. p. 175, vera Manger) at 90,000
heads.]

[Footnote 26: The ancients, Jornandes, Priscus, &c., are ignorant of
this epithet. The modern Hungarians have imagined, that it was applied,
by a hermit of Gaul, to Attila, who was pleased to insert it among the
titles of his royal dignity. Mascou, ix. 23, and Tillemont, Hist. des
Empereurs, tom. vi. p. 143.]
