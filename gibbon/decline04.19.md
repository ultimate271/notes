## Chapter XLIII: Last Victory And Death Of Belisarius, Death OF Justinian.--Part II.

The foresight of Totila had raised obstacles worthy of such an
antagonist. Ninety furlongs below the city, in the narrowest part of the
river, he joined the two banks by strong and solid timbers in the form
of a bridge, on which he erected two lofty towers, manned by the bravest
of his Goths, and profusely stored with missile weapons and engines of
offence. The approach of the bridge and towers was covered by a strong
and massy chain of iron; and the chain, at either end, on the opposite
sides of the Tyber, was defended by a numerous and chosen detachment of
archers. But the enterprise of forcing these barriers, and relieving
the capital, displays a shining example of the boldness and conduct of
Belisarius. His cavalry advanced from the port along the public road, to
awe the motions, and distract the attention of the enemy. His infantry
and provisions were distributed in two hundred large boats; and each
boat was shielded by a high rampart of thick planks, pierced with many
small holes for the discharge of missile weapons. In the front, two
large vessels were linked together to sustain a floating castle, which
commanded the towers of the bridge, and contained a magazine of fire,
sulphur, and bitumen. The whole fleet, which the general led in person,
was laboriously moved against the current of the river. The chain
yielded to their weight, and the enemies who guarded the banks were
either slain or scattered. As soon as they touched the principal
barrier, the fire-ship was instantly grappled to the bridge; one of
the towers, with two hundred Goths, was consumed by the flames; the
assailants shouted victory; and Rome was saved, if the wisdom of
Belisarius had not been defeated by the misconduct of his officers.
He had previously sent orders to Bessas to second his operations by a
timely sally from the town; and he had fixed his lieutenant, Isaac, by
a peremptory command, to the station of the port. But avarice rendered
Bessas immovable; while the youthful ardor of Isaac delivered him into
the hands of a superior enemy. The exaggerated rumor of his defeat was
hastily carried to the ears of Belisarius: he paused; betrayed in that
single moment of his life some emotions of surprise and perplexity; and
reluctantly sounded a retreat to save his wife Antonina, his treasures,
and the only harbor which he possessed on the Tuscan coast. The vexation
of his mind produced an ardent and almost mortal fever; and Rome was
left without protection to the mercy or indignation of Totila. The
continuance of hostilities had imbittered the national hatred: the Arian
clergy was ignominiously driven from Rome; Pelagius, the archdeacon,
returned without success from an embassy to the Gothic camp; and a
Sicilian bishop, the envoy or nuncio of the pope, was deprived of both
his hands, for daring to utter falsehoods in the service of the church
and state.

Famine had relaxed the strength and discipline of the garrison of Rome.
They could derive no effectual service from a dying people; and the
inhuman avarice of the merchant at length absorbed the vigilance of the
governor. Four Isaurian sentinels, while their companions slept, and
their officers were absent, descended by a rope from the wall, and
secretly proposed to the Gothic king to introduce his troops into
the city. The offer was entertained with coldness and suspicion; they
returned in safety; they twice repeated their visit; the place was twice
examined; the conspiracy was known and disregarded; and no sooner had
Totila consented to the attempt, than they unbarred the Asinarian gate,
and gave admittance to the Goths. Till the dawn of day, they halted in
order of battle, apprehensive of treachery or ambush; but the troops of
Bessas, with their leader, had already escaped; and when the king was
pressed to disturb their retreat, he prudently replied, that no sight
could be more grateful than that of a flying enemy. The patricians, who
were still possessed of horses, Decius, Basilius, &c. accompanied the
governor; their brethren, among whom Olybrius, Orestes, and Maximus, are
named by the historian, took refuge in the church of St. Peter: but
the assertion, that only five hundred persons remained in the capital,
inspires some doubt of the fidelity either of his narrative or of his
text. As soon as daylight had displayed the entire victory of the Goths,
their monarch devoutly visited the tomb of the prince of the apostles;
but while he prayed at the altar, twenty-five soldiers, and sixty
citizens, were put to the sword in the vestibule of the temple. The
archdeacon Pelagius [13] stood before him, with the Gospels in his hand.
"O Lord, be merciful to your servant." "Pelagius," said Totila, with an
insulting smile, "your pride now condescends to become a suppliant." "I
am a suppliant," replied the prudent archdeacon; "God has now made us
your subjects, and as your subjects, we are entitled to your clemency."
At his humble prayer, the lives of the Romans were spared; and the
chastity of the maids and matrons was preserved inviolate from the
passions of the hungry soldiers.

But they were rewarded by the freedom of pillage, after the most
precious spoils had been reserved for the royal treasury. The houses
of the senators were plentifully stored with gold and silver; and the
avarice of Bessas had labored with so much guilt and shame for the
benefit of the conqueror. In this revolution, the sons and daughters
of Roman consuls lasted the misery which they had spurned or relieved,
wandered in tattered garments through the streets of the city and
begged their bread, perhaps without success, before the gates of their
hereditary mansions. The riches of Rusticiana, the daughter of Symmachus
and widow of Boethius, had been generously devoted to alleviate the
calamities of famine. But the Barbarians were exasperated by the report,
that she had prompted the people to overthrow the statues of the
great Theodoric; and the life of that venerable matron would have been
sacrificed to his memory, if Totila had not respected her birth, her
virtues, and even the pious motive of her revenge. The next day he
pronounced two orations, to congratulate and admonish his victorious
Goths, and to reproach the senate, as the vilest of slaves, with their
perjury, folly, and ingratitude; sternly declaring, that their estates
and honors were justly forfeited to the companions of his arms. Yet he
consented to forgive their revolt; and the senators repaid his clemency
by despatching circular letters to their tenants and vassals in the
provinces of Italy, strictly to enjoin them to desert the standard of
the Greeks, to cultivate their lands in peace, and to learn from their
masters the duty of obedience to a Gothic sovereign. Against the city
which had so long delayed the course of his victories, he appeared
inexorable: one third of the walls, in different parts, were demolished
by his command; fire and engines prepared to consume or subvert the most
stately works of antiquity; and the world was astonished by the fatal
decree, that Rome should be changed into a pasture for cattle. The firm
and temperate remonstrance of Belisarius suspended the execution; he
warned the Barbarian not to sully his fame by the destruction of those
monuments which were the glory of the dead, and the delight of the
living; and Totila was persuaded, by the advice of an enemy, to preserve
Rome as the ornament of his kingdom, or the fairest pledge of peace and
reconciliation. When he had signified to the ambassadors of Belisarius
his intention of sparing the city, he stationed an army at the distance
of one hundred and twenty furlongs, to observe the motions of the Roman
general. With the remainder of his forces he marched into Lucania and
Apulia, and occupied on the summit of Mount Garganus [14] one of the
camps of Hannibal. [15] The senators were dragged in his train, and
afterwards confined in the fortresses of Campania: the citizens, with
their wives and children, were dispersed in exile; and during forty days
Rome was abandoned to desolate and dreary solitude. [16]

[Footnote 13: During the long exile, and after the death of Vigilius,
the Roman church was governed, at first by the archdeacon, and at length
(A. D 655) by the pope Pelagius, who was not thought guiltless of the
sufferings of his predecessor. See the original lives of the popes under
the name of Anastasius, (Muratori, Script. Rer. Italicarum, tom. iii. P.
i. p. 130, 131,) who relates several curious incidents of the sieges of
Rome and the wars of Italy.]

[Footnote 14: Mount Garganus, now Monte St. Angelo, in the kingdom of
Naples, runs three hundred stadia into the Adriatic Sea, (Strab.--vi.
p. 436,) and in the darker ages was illustrated by the apparition,
miracles, and church, of St. Michael the archangel. Horace, a native of
Apulia or Lucania, had seen the elms and oaks of Garganus laboring and
bellowing with the north wind that blew on that lofty coast, (Carm. ii.
9, Epist. ii. i. 201.)]

[Footnote 15: I cannot ascertain this particular camp of Hannibal; but
the Punic quarters were long and often in the neighborhood of Arpi, (T.
Liv. xxii. 9, 12, xxiv. 3, &c.)]

[Footnote 16: Totila.... Romam ingreditur.... ac evertit muros, domos
aliquantas igni comburens, ac omnes Romanorum res in praedam ac
cepit, hos ipsos Romanos in Campaniam captivos abduxit. Post quam
devastationem, xl. autamp lius dies, Roma fuit ita desolata, ut nemo
ibi hominum, nisi (nulloe?) bestiae morarentur, (Marcellin. in Chron. p.
54.)]

The loss of Rome was speedily retrieved by an action, to which,
according to the event, the public opinion would apply the names of
rashness or heroism. After the departure of Totila, the Roman general
sallied from the port at the head of a thousand horse, cut in pieces the
enemy who opposed his progress, and visited with pity and reverence
the vacant space of the eternal city. Resolved to maintain a station so
conspicuous in the eyes of mankind, he summoned the greatest part of
his troops to the standard which he erected on the Capitol: the old
inhabitants were recalled by the love of their country and the hopes
of food; and the keys of Rome were sent a second time to the emperor
Justinian. The walls, as far as they had been demolished by the
Goths, were repaired with rude and dissimilar materials; the ditch was
restored; iron spikes [17] were profusely scattered in the highways to
annoy the feet of the horses; and as new gates could not suddenly be
procured, the entrance was guarded by a Spartan rampart of his bravest
soldiers. At the expiration of twenty-five days, Totila returned by
hasty marches from Apulia to avenge the injury and disgrace. Belisarius
expected his approach. The Goths were thrice repulsed in three general
assaults; they lost the flower of their troops; the royal standard had
almost fallen into the hands of the enemy, and the fame of Totila
sunk, as it had risen, with the fortune of his arms. Whatever skill
and courage could achieve, had been performed by the Roman general:
it remained only that Justinian should terminate, by a strong and
seasonable effort, the war which he had ambitiously undertaken. The
indolence, perhaps the impotence, of a prince who despised his enemies,
and envied his servants, protracted the calamities of Italy. After a
long silence, Belisarius was commanded to leave a sufficient garrison
at Rome, and to transport himself into the province of Lucania, whose
inhabitants, inflamed by Catholic zeal, had cast away the yoke of their
Arian conquerors. In this ignoble warfare, the hero, invincible against
the power of the Barbarians, was basely vanquished by the delay, the
disobedience, and the cowardice of his own officers. He reposed in his
winter quarters of Crotona, in the full assurance, that the two passes
of the Lucanian hills were guarded by his cavalry. They were betrayed by
treachery or weakness; and the rapid march of the Goths scarcely allowed
time for the escape of Belisarius to the coast of Sicily. At length a
fleet and army were assembled for the relief of Ruscianum, or Rossano,
[18] a fortress sixty furlongs from the ruins of Sybaris, where the
nobles of Lucania had taken refuge. In the first attempt, the Roman
forces were dissipated by a storm. In the second, they approached the
shore; but they saw the hills covered with archers, the landing-place
defended by a line of spears, and the king of the Goths impatient for
battle. The conqueror of Italy retired with a sigh, and continued to
languish, inglorious and inactive, till Antonina, who had been sent
to Constantinople to solicit succors, obtained, after the death of the
empress, the permission of his return.

[Footnote 17: The tribuli are small engines with four spikes, one fixed
in the ground, the three others erect or adverse, (Procopius, Gothic.
l. iii. c. 24. Just. Lipsius, Poliorcetwv, l. v. c. 3.) The metaphor
was borrowed from the tribuli, (land-caltrops,) an herb with a prickly
fruit, commex in Italy. (Martin, ad Virgil. Georgic. i. 153 vol. ii. p.
33.)]

[Footnote 18: Ruscia, the navale Thuriorum, was transferred to the
distance of sixty stadia to Ruscianum, Rossano, an archbishopric without
suffragans. The republic of Sybaris is now the estate of the duke
of Corigliano. (Riedesel, Travels into Magna Graecia and Sicily, p.
166--171.)]

The five last campaigns of Belisarius might abate the envy of his
competitors, whose eyes had been dazzled and wounded by the blaze of
his former glory. Instead of delivering Italy from the Goths, he had
wandered like a fugitive along the coast, without daring to march into
the country, or to accept the bold and repeated challenge of Totila.
Yet, in the judgment of the few who could discriminate counsels from
events, and compare the instruments with the execution, he appeared
a more consummate master of the art of war, than in the season of his
prosperity, when he presented two captive kings before the throne of
Justinian. The valor of Belisarius was not chilled by age: his prudence
was matured by experience; but the moral virtues of humanity and justice
seem to have yielded to the hard necessity of the times. The parsimony
or poverty of the emperor compelled him to deviate from the rule of
conduct which had deserved the love and confidence of the Italians. The
war was maintained by the oppression of Ravenna, Sicily, and all
the faithful subjects of the empire; and the rigorous prosecution of
Herodian provoked that injured or guilty officer to deliver Spoleto into
the hands of the enemy. The avarice of Antonina, which had been some
times diverted by love, now reigned without a rival in her breast.
Belisarius himself had always understood, that riches, in a corrupt
age, are the support and ornament of personal merit. And it cannot be
presumed that he should stain his honor for the public service, without
applying a part of the spoil to his private emolument. The hero had
escaped the sword of the Barbarians. But the dagger of conspiracy [19]
awaited his return. In the midst of wealth and honors, Artaban, who had
chastised the African tyrant, complained of the ingratitude of courts.
He aspired to Praejecta, the emperor's niece, who wished to reward her
deliverer; but the impediment of his previous marriage was asserted
by the piety of Theodora. The pride of royal descent was irritated by
flattery; and the service in which he gloried had proved him capable of
bold and sanguinary deeds. The death of Justinian was resolved, but the
conspirators delayed the execution till they could surprise Belisarius
disarmed, and naked, in the palace of Constantinople. Not a hope could
be entertained of shaking his long-tried fidelity; and they justly
dreaded the revenge, or rather the justice, of the veteran general, who
might speedily assemble an army in Thrace to punish the assassins, and
perhaps to enjoy the fruits of their crime. Delay afforded time for rash
communications and honest confessions: Artaban and his accomplices were
condemned by the senate, but the extreme clemency of Justinian detained
them in the gentle confinement of the palace, till he pardoned their
flagitious attempt against his throne and life. If the emperor forgave
his enemies, he must cordially embrace a friend whose victories were
alone remembered, and who was endeared to his prince by the recent
circumstances of their common danger. Belisarius reposed from his toils,
in the high station of general of the East and count of the domestics;
and the older consuls and patricians respectfully yielded the precedency
of rank to the peerless merit of the first of the Romans. [20] The
first of the Romans still submitted to be the slave of his wife; but the
servitude of habit and affection became less disgraceful when the death
of Theodora had removed the baser influence of fear. Joannina, their
daughter, and the sole heiress of their fortunes, was betrothed to
Anastasius, the grandson, or rather the nephew, of the empress, [21]
whose kind interposition forwarded the consummation of their youthful
loves. But the power of Theodora expired, the parents of Joannina
returned, and her honor, perhaps her happiness, were sacrificed to the
revenge of an unfeeling mother, who dissolved the imperfect nuptials
before they had been ratified by the ceremonies of the church. [22]

[Footnote 19: This conspiracy is related by Procopius (Gothic. l.
iii. c. 31, 32) with such freedom and candor, that the liberty of the
Anecdotes gives him nothing to add.]

[Footnote 20: The honors of Belisarius are gladly commemorated by his
secretary, (Procop. Goth. l. iii. c. 35, l. iv. c. 21.) This title is
ill translated, at least in this instance, by praefectus praetorio; and
to a military character, magister militum is more proper and applicable,
(Ducange, Gloss. Graec. p. 1458, 1459.)]

[Footnote 21: Alemannus, (ad Hist. Arcanum, p. 68,) Ducange, (Familiae
Byzant. p. 98,) and Heineccius, (Hist. Juris Civilis, p. 434,) all three
represent Anastasius as the son of the daughter of Theodora; and their
opinion firmly reposes on the unambiguous testimony of Procopius,
(Anecdot. c. 4, 5,--twice repeated.) And yet I will remark, 1. That
in the year 547, Theodora could sarcely have a grandson of the age
of puberty; 2. That we are totally ignorant of this daughter and her
husband; and, 3. That Theodora concealed her bastards, and that her
grandson by Justinian would have been heir apparent of the empire.]

[Footnote 22: The sins of the hero in Italy and after his return, are
manifested, and most probably swelled, by the author of the Anecdotes,
(c. 4, 5.) The designs of Antonina were favored by the fluctuating
jurisprudence of Justinian. On the law of marriage and divorce, that
emperor was trocho versatilior, (Heineccius, Element Juris Civil. ad
Ordinem Pandect. P. iv. No. 233.)]

Before the departure of Belisarius, Perusia was besieged, and few cities
were impregnable to the Gothic arms. Ravenna, Ancona, and Crotona, still
resisted the Barbarians; and when Totila asked in marriage one of the
daughters of France, he was stung by the just reproach that the king of
Italy was unworthy of his title till it was acknowledged by the Roman
people. Three thousand of the bravest soldiers had been left to
defend the capital. On the suspicion of a monopoly, they massacred the
governor, and announced to Justinian, by a deputation of the clergy,
that unless their offence was pardoned, and their arrears were
satisfied, they should instantly accept the tempting offers of Totila.
But the officer who succeeded to the command (his name was Diogenes)
deserved their esteem and confidence; and the Goths, instead of finding
an easy conquest, encountered a vigorous resistance from the soldiers
and people, who patiently endured the loss of the port and of all
maritime supplies. The siege of Rome would perhaps have been raised,
if the liberality of Totila to the Isaurians had not encouraged some of
their venal countrymen to copy the example of treason. In a dark night,
while the Gothic trumpets sounded on another side, they silently opened
the gate of St. Paul: the Barbarians rushed into the city; and the
flying garrison was intercepted before they could reach the harbor of
Centumcellae. A soldier trained in the school of Belisarius, Paul of
Cilicia, retired with four hundred men to the mole of Hadrian. They
repelled the Goths; but they felt the approach of famine; and their
aversion to the taste of horse-flesh confirmed their resolution to risk
the event of a desperate and decisive sally. But their spirit insensibly
stooped to the offers of capitulation; they retrieved their arrears of
pay, and preserved their arms and horses, by enlisting in the service of
Totila; their chiefs, who pleaded a laudable attachment to their wives
and children in the East, were dismissed with honor; and above four
hundred enemies, who had taken refuge in the sanctuaries, were saved
by the clemency of the victor. He no longer entertained a wish of
destroying the edifices of Rome, [23] which he now respected as the
seat of the Gothic kingdom: the senate and people were restored to their
country; the means of subsistence were liberally provided; and Totila,
in the robe of peace, exhibited the equestrian games of the circus.
Whilst he amused the eyes of the multitude, four hundred vessels were
prepared for the embarkation of his troops. The cities of Rhegium
and Tarentum were reduced: he passed into Sicily, the object of his
implacable resentment; and the island was stripped of its gold and
silver, of the fruits of the earth, and of an infinite number of horses,
sheep, and oxen. Sardinia and Corsica obeyed the fortune of Italy; and
the sea-coast of Greece was visited by a fleet of three hundred galleys.
[24] The Goths were landed in Corcyra and the ancient continent of
Epirus; they advanced as far as Nicopolis, the trophy of Augustus, and
Dodona, [25] once famous by the oracle of Jove. In every step of his
victories, the wise Barbarian repeated to Justinian the desire of peace,
applauded the concord of their predecessors, and offered to employ the
Gothic arms in the service of the empire.

[Footnote 23: The Romans were still attached to the monuments of their
ancestors; and according to Procopius, (Goth. l. iv. c. 22,) the gallery
of Aeneas, of a single rank of oars, 25 feet in breadth, 120 in length,
was preserved entire in the navalia, near Monte Testaceo, at the foot of
the Aventine, (Nardini, Roma Antica, l. vii. c. 9, p. 466. Donatus, Rom
Antiqua, l. iv. c. 13, p. 334) But all antiquity is ignorant of relic.]

[Footnote 24: In these seas Procopius searched without success for the
Isle of Calypso. He was shown, at Phaeacia, or Cocyra, the petrified
ship of Ulysses, (Odyss. xiii. 163;) but he found it a recent fabric of
many stones, dedicated by a merchant to Jupiter Cassius, (l. iv. c. 22.)
Eustathius had supposed it to be the fanciful likeness of a rock.]

[Footnote 25: M. D'Anville (Memoires de l'Acad. tom. xxxii. p. 513--528)
illustrates the Gulf of Ambracia; but he cannot ascertain the situation
of Dodona. A country in sight of Italy is less known than the wilds of
America. Note: On the site of Dodona compare Walpole's Travels in the
East, vol. ii. p. 473; Col. Leake's Northern Greece, vol. iv. p. 163;
and a dissertation by the present bishop of Lichfield (Dr. Butler) in
the appendix to Hughes's Travels, vol. i. p. 511.--M.]

Justinian was deaf to the voice of peace: but he neglected the
prosecution of war; and the indolence of his temper disappointed, in
some degree, the obstinacy of his passions. From this salutary slumber
the emperor was awakened by the pope Vigilius and the patrician
Cethegus, who appeared before his throne, and adjured him, in the name
of God and the people, to resume the conquest and deliverance of Italy.
In the choice of the generals, caprice, as well as judgment, was shown.
A fleet and army sailed for the relief of Sicily, under the conduct of
Liberius; but his youth [2511] and want of experience were afterwards
discovered, and before he touched the shores of the island he was
overtaken by his successor. In the place of Liberius, the conspirator
Artaban was raised from a prison to military honors; in the pious
presumption, that gratitude would animate his valor and fortify his
allegiance. Belisarius reposed in the shade of his laurels, but the
command of the principal army was reserved for Germanus, [26] the
emperor's nephew, whose rank and merit had been long depressed by the
jealousy of the court. Theodora had injured him in the rights of a
private citizen, the marriage of his children, and the testament of his
brother; and although his conduct was pure and blameless, Justinian was
displeased that he should be thought worthy of the confidence of the
malecontents. The life of Germanus was a lesson of implicit obedience:
he nobly refused to prostitute his name and character in the factions
of the circus: the gravity of his manners was tempered by innocent
cheerfulness; and his riches were lent without interest to indigent or
deserving friends. His valor had formerly triumphed over the Sclavonians
of the Danube and the rebels of Africa: the first report of his
promotion revived the hopes of the Italians; and he was privately
assured, that a crowd of Roman deserters would abandon, on his approach,
the standard of Totila. His second marriage with Malasontha, the
granddaughter of Theodoric endeared Germanus to the Goths themselves;
and they marched with reluctance against the father of a royal infant
the last offspring of the line of Amali. [27] A splendid allowance was
assigned by the emperor: the general contribute his private fortune: his
two sons were popular and active and he surpassed, in the promptitude
and success of his levies the expectation of mankind. He was permitted
to select some squadrons of Thracian cavalry: the veterans, as well as
the youth of Constantinople and Europe, engaged their voluntary service;
and as far as the heart of Germany, his fame and liberality attracted
the aid of the Barbarians. [2711] The Romans advanced to Sardica; an
army of Sclavonians fled before their march; but within two days of
their final departure, the designs of Germanus were terminated by his
malady and death. Yet the impulse which he had given to the Italian
war still continued to act with energy and effect. The maritime towns
Ancona, Crotona, Centumcellae, resisted the assaults of Totila Sicily
was reduced by the zeal of Artaban, and the Gothic navy was defeated
near the coast of the Adriatic. The two fleets were almost equal,
forty-seven to fifty galleys: the victory was decided by the knowledge
and dexterity of the Greeks; but the ships were so closely grappled,
that only twelve of the Goths escaped from this unfortunate conflict.
They affected to depreciate an element in which they were unskilled; but
their own experience confirmed the truth of a maxim, that the master of
the sea will always acquire the dominion of the land. [28]

[Footnote 2511: This is a singular mistake. Gibbon must have hastily
caught at his inexperience, and concluded that it must have been from
youth. Lord Mahon has pointed out this error, p. 401. I should add that
in the last 4to. edition, corrected by Gibbon, it stands "want of
youth and experience;"--but Gibbon can scarcely have intended such a
phrase.--M.]

After the loss of Germanus, the nations were provoked to smile, by the
strange intelligence, that the command of the Roman armies was given to
a eunuch. But the eunuch Narses [29] is ranked among the few who have
rescued that unhappy name from the contempt and hatred of mankind. A
feeble, diminutive body concealed the soul of a statesman and a warrior.
His youth had been employed in the management of the loom and distaff,
in the cares of the household, and the service of female luxury; but
while his hands were busy, he secretly exercised the faculties of a
vigorous and discerning mind. A stranger to the schools and the camp, he
studied in the palace to dissemble, to flatter, and to persuade; and as
soon as he approached the person of the emperor, Justinian listened
with surprise and pleasure to the manly counsels of his chamberlain and
private treasurer. [30] The talents of Narses were tried and improved
in frequent embassies: he led an army into Italy acquired a practical
knowledge of the war and the country, and presumed to strive with the
genius of Belisarius. Twelve years after his return, the eunuch was
chosen to achieve the conquest which had been left imperfect by the
first of the Roman generals. Instead of being dazzled by vanity or
emulation, he seriously declared that, unless he were armed with an
adequate force, he would never consent to risk his own glory and that
of his sovereign. Justinian granted to the favorite what he might have
denied to the hero: the Gothic war was rekindled from its ashes, and the
preparations were not unworthy of the ancient majesty of the empire. The
key of the public treasure was put into his hand, to collect magazines,
to levy soldiers, to purchase arms and horses, to discharge the arrears
of pay, and to tempt the fidelity of the fugitives and deserters. The
troops of Germanus were still in arms; they halted at Salona in the
expectation of a new leader; and legions of subjects and allies were
created by the well-known liberality of the eunuch Narses. The king of
the Lombards [31] satisfied or surpassed the obligations of a treaty, by
lending two thousand two hundred of his bravest warriors, [3111] who were
followed by three thousand of their martial attendants. Three thousand
Heruli fought on horseback under Philemuth, their native chief; and the
noble Aratus, who adopted the manners and discipline of Rome, conducted
a band of veterans of the same nation. Dagistheus was released from
prison to command the Huns; and Kobad, the grandson and nephew of
the great king, was conspicuous by the regal tiara at the head of his
faithful Persians, who had devoted themselves to the fortunes of their
prince. [32] Absolute in the exercise of his authority, more absolute in
the affection of his troops, Narses led a numerous and gallant army from
Philippopolis to Salona, from whence he coasted the eastern side of the
Adriatic as far as the confines of Italy. His progress was checked. The
East could not supply vessels capable of transporting such multitudes of
men and horses. The Franks, who, in the general confusion, had usurped
the greater part of the Venetian province, refused a free passage to the
friends of the Lombards. The station of Verona was occupied by Teias,
with the flower of the Gothic forces; and that skilful commander
had overspread the adjacent country with the fall of woods and the
inundation of waters. [33] In this perplexity, an officer of experience
proposed a measure, secure by the appearance of rashness; that the
Roman army should cautiously advance along the seashore, while the fleet
preceded their march, and successively cast a bridge of boats over the
mouths of the rivers, the Timavus, the Brenta, the Adige, and the
Po, that fall into the Adriatic to the north of Ravenna. Nine days he
reposed in the city, collected the fragments of the Italian army, and
marching towards Rimini to meet the defiance of an insulting enemy.

[Footnote 29: Procopius relates the whole series of this second Gothic
war and the victory of Narses, (l. iv. c. 21, 26--35.) A splendid scene.
Among the six subjects of epic poetry which Tasso revolved in his mind,
he hesitated between the conquests of Italy by Belisarius and by Narses,
(Hayley's Works, vol. iv. p. 70.)]

[Footnote 30: The country of Narses is unknown, since he must not be
confounded with the Persarmenian. Procopius styles him (see Goth. l. ii.
c. 13); Paul Warnefrid, (l. ii. c. 3, p. 776,) Chartularius: Marcellinus
adds the name of Cubicularius. In an inscription on the Salarian bridge
he is entitled Ex-consul, Ex-praepositus, Cubiculi Patricius, (Mascou,
Hist. of the Germans, (l. xiii. c. 25.) The law of Theodosius against
ennuchs was obsolete or abolished, Annotation xx.,) but the foolish
prophecy of the Romans subsisted in full vigor, (Procop. l. iv. c. 21.)
* Note: Lord Mahon supposes them both to have been Persarmenians. Note,
p. 256.--M.]

[Footnote 31: Paul Warnefrid, the Lombard, records with complacency the
succor, service, and honorable dismission of his countrymen--reipublicae
Romanae adversus aemulos adjutores fuerant, (l. ii. c. i. p. 774, edit.
Grot.) I am surprised that Alboin, their martial king, did not lead
his subjects in person. * Note: The Lombards were still at war with the
Gepidae. See Procop. Goth. lib. iv. p. 25.--M.]

[Footnote 3111: Gibbon has blindly followed the translation of Maltretus:
Bis mille ducentos--while the original Greek says expressly something
else, (Goth. lib. iv. c. 26.) In like manner, (p. 266,) he draws
volunteers from Germany, on the authority of Cousin, who, in one place,
has mistaken Germanus for Germania. Yet only a few pages further we find
Gibbon loudly condemning the French and Latin readers of Procopius. Lord
Mahon, p. 403. The first of these errors remains uncorrected in the new
edition of the Byzantines.--M.]

[Footnote 32: He was, if not an impostor, the son of the blind Zames,
saved by compassion, and educated in the Byzantine court by the various
motives of policy, pride, and generosity, (Procop. Persic. l. i. c.
23.)]

[Footnote 33: In the time of Augustus, and in the middle ages, the
whole waste from Aquileia to Ravenna was covered with woods, lakes, and
morasses. Man has subdued nature, and the land has been cultivated since
the waters are confined and embanked. See the learned researches of
Muratori, (Antiquitat. Italiae Medii Aevi. tom. i. dissert xxi. p.
253, 254,) from Vitruvius, Strabo, Herodian, old charters, and local
knowledge.]
