S01E02 The naked now
    Summary
    The crew of the Enterprise finds themselves infected by a strange mental
    illness that creates inebraited effects in those impaired by it. The
    women become aggressively promiscously, and the men give in to their
    animalistic instincts. Wesley, a young boy, takes over the ship, and
    declares himself the captain. The crew is able to find a cure and warp
    out just in time.

    First Impression
    A good classic trek episode, setting the precedent for what the dynamic
    of the crew is going to be like. Introduces the characters quite well.
