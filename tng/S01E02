    First Impression
    A good classic trek episode, setting the precedent for what the dynamic
    of the crew is going to be like. Introduces the characters quite well.

    courtship.

    First Impression
    A rather interesting episode, I'm always a sucker for these sorts
    of episodes which involve ancient mating rituals and things of that
    sort. Good dialog, wesley is a good character.

    Quotable line
    Doctor: At what point does a doctor earn the callusses of her heart?
    Captain: Perhaps the good ones never do.
