## THE UNCONSCIOUS ADDITIONAL CREATIVE WORK.

We have now discussed all the essential manifestations offered by
our case which are of significance for its inner structure. Certain
accompanying manifestations may be briefly considered: _the unconscious
additional creative work_. Here we shall encounter a not altogether
unjustifiable scepticism on the part of the representative of science.
Dessoir's conception of a second ego met with much opposition, and was
rejected, as too impossible in many directions. As is known, occultism
has proclaimed a pre-eminent right to this field and has drawn premature
conclusions from doubtful observations. We are indeed very far from
being in a position to state anything conclusive, since we have at
present only most inadequate material. Therefore if we touch on the
field of the unconscious additional creative work, it is only that we
may do justice to all sides of our case. _By unconscious addition we
understand that automatic process whose result does not penetrate to
the conscious psychic activity of the individual._ To this region above
all belongs thought-reading through table movements. I do not know
whether there are people who can divine a whole long train of thought
by means of inductions from the intentional tremulous movements. It is,
however, certain that, assuming this to be possible, such persons must
be availing themselves of a routine achieved after endless practice. But
in our case long practice can be excluded without more ado, and there is
nothing left but to accept a primary susceptibility of the unconscious,
far exceeding that of the conscious.

This supposition is supported by numerous observations on somnambulists.
I will mention only Binet's[110] experiments, where little letters
or some such thing, or little complicated figures in relief were
laid on the anæsthetic skin of the back of the hand or the neck, and
the unconscious perceptions were then recorded by means of signs. On
the basis of these experiments he came to the following conclusion:
"D'après les calculs que j'ai pu faire, la sensibilité inconsciente
d'une hystérique est à certains moments _cinquante fois_ plus fine que
celle d'une personne normale." A second additional creation coming under
consideration in our case and in numerous other somnambulists, is that
condition which French investigators call "cryptomnesia."[111] By this
term is meant the becoming conscious of a memory-picture which cannot
be regarded as in itself primary, but at most is secondary, by means
of subsequent recalling or abstract reasoning. It is characteristic of
cryptomnesia that the picture which emerges does not bear the obvious
mark of the memory-picture, is not, that is to say, bound up with the
idiosyncratic super-conscious ego-complex.

Three ways may be distinguished in which the cryptomnesic picture is
brought to consciousness.

1. _The picture enters consciousness without any intervention of the
sense-spheres (intra-psychically)._ It is an inrushing idea whose
causal sequence is hidden within the individual. In so far cryptomnesia
is quite an everyday occurrence, concerned with the deepest normal
psychic events. How often it misleads the investigator, the author
or the composer into believing his ideas original, whilst the critic
quite well recognises their source! Generally the individuality of the
representation protects the author from the accusation of plagiarism
and proves his good faith; still, cases do occur of unconscious verbal
reproduction. Should the passage in question contain some remarkable
idea, the accusation of plagiarism, more or less conscious, is
justified. After all, a valuable idea is linked by numerous associations
with the ego-complex; at different times, in different situations, it
has already been meditated upon and thus leads by innumerable links in
all directions. It can therefore never so disappear from consciousness
that its continuity could be entirely lost from the sphere of conscious
memory. We have, however, a criterion by which we can always recognise
objectively intra-psychic cryptomnesia. The cryptomnesic presentation
is linked to the ego-complex by the minimum of associations. The reason
for this lies in the relation of the individual to the particular
object, in the disproportion of interest to object. Two possibilities
occur: (1) The object is worthy of interest but the interest is slight
in consequence of dispersion or want of understanding; (2) The object
is not worthy of interest, consequently the interest is slight. In
both cases an extremely labile connection with consciousness arises
which leads to a rapid forgetting. The slight bridge is soon destroyed
and the acquired presentation sinks into the unconscious, where it is
no longer accessible to consciousness. Should it enter consciousness
by means of cryptomnesia, the feeling of strangeness, of its being an
original creation, will cling to it because the path by which it entered
the subconscious has become undiscoverable. Strangeness and original
creation are, moreover, closely allied to one another if one recalls
the numerous witnesses in _belles-lettres_ to the nature of genius
("possession" by genius).[112]

Apart from certain striking cases of this kind, where it is doubtful
whether it is a cryptomnesia or an original creation, there are some
cases in which a passage of no essential content is reproduced, and that
almost verbally, as in the following example:--

About that time when Zarathustra lived on the blissful islands, it came
to pass that a ship cast anchor at that island on which the smoking
mountain standeth; and the sailors of that ship went ashore in order to
shoot rabbits! But about the hour of noon, when the captain and his men
had mustered again, they suddenly saw a man come through the air unto
them, and a voice said distinctly: "It is time! It is high time!" But
when that person was nighest unto them (he passed by them flying quickly
like a shadow, in the direction in which the volcano was situated) they
recognised with the greatest confusion that it was Zarathustra. For all
of them, except the captain, had seen him before, and they loved him, as
the folk love, blending love and awe in equal parts. "Lo! there," said
the old steersman, "Zarathustra goeth unto hell!"

       *       *       *       *       *

An extract of awe-inspiring import from the log of the ship "Sphinx" in
the year 1686, in the Mediterranean.

Just. Kerner, "Blätter aus Prevorst," vol. IV., p, 57.

The four captains and a merchant, Mr. Bell, went ashore on the island of
Mount Stromboli to shoot rabbits. At three o'clock they called the crew
together to go aboard, when, to their inexpressible astonishment, they
saw two men flying rapidly over them through the air. One was dressed
in black, the other in grey. They approached them very closely, in the
greatest haste; to their greatest dismay they descended amid the burning
flames into the crater of the terrible volcano, Mount Stromboli. They
recognised the pair as acquaintances from London.

Frau E. Förster-Nietzsche, the poet's sister, told me, in reply to my
inquiry, that Nietzsche took up Just. Kerner between the age of twelve
and fifteen, when stopping with his grandfather, Pastor Oehler, in
Pobler, but certainly never afterwards. It could never have been the
poet's intention to commit a plagiarism from a ship's log; if this had
been the case, he would certainly have omitted the very prosaic "to
shoot rabbits," which was, moreover, quite unessential to the situation.
In the poetical sketch of Zarathustra's journey into Hell there was
obviously interpolated, half or wholly unconsciously, that forgotten
impression from his youth.

This is an instance which shows all the peculiarities of cryptomnesia.
A quite unessential detail, which deserves nothing but speedy
forgetting, is reproduced with almost verbal fidelity, whilst the
chief part of the narrative is, one cannot say altered, but recreated
quite distinctively. To the distinctive core, the idea of the journey
to Hell, there is added a detail, the old, forgotten impression of
a similar situation. The original is so absurd that the youth, who
read everything, probably skipped through it, and certainly had no
deep interest in it. Here we get the required minimum of associated
links, for we cannot easily conceive a greater jump, than from that
old, absurd story to Nietzsche's consciousness in the year 1883. If we
picture to ourselves Nietzsche's mood at the time when "Zarathustra"
was composed,[113] and think of the ecstasy that at more than one
point approached the pathological, we shall comprehend the abnormal
reminiscence. The second of the two possibilities mentioned, the
acceptance of some object, not itself uninteresting, in a state of
dispersion or half interest from lack of understanding, and its
cryptomnesic reproduction we find chiefly in somnambulists; it is also
found in the literary chronicles dealing with dying celebrities.[114]

Amid the exhaustive selection of these phenomena we are chiefly
concerned with _talking in a foreign tongue, the so-called glossolalia_.
This phenomenon is mentioned everywhere when it is a question of similar
ecstatic conditions. In the New Testament, in the _Acta Sanctorum_,[115]
in the Witchcraft Trials, more recently in the Prophetess of Prevorst,
in Judge Edmond's daughter Laura, in Flournoy's Helen Smith. The last
is unique from the point of view of investigation; it is found also in
Bresler's[116] case, which is probably identical with Blumhardt's[117]
Gottlieben Dittus. As Flournoy shows, glossolalia is, so far as it
really is independent speech, a cryptomnesic phenomenon, [Greek:
Kat' exochên]. The reader should consult Flournoy's most interesting
exposition.

In our case glossolalia was only once observed, when the only
understandable words were the scattered variations on the word "vena."
The source of this word is clear. A few days previously the patient
had dipped into an anatomical atlas for the study of the veins of the
face, which were given in Latin. She had used the word "vena" in her
dreams, as happens occasionally to normal persons. The remaining words
and sentences in a foreign language betray, at the first glance, their
derivation from French, in which the patient was somewhat fluent.
Unfortunately I am without the more accurate translations of the various
sentences, because the patient would not give them; but we may hold
that it was a phenomenon similar to Helen Smith's Martian language.
Flournoy found that the Martian language was nothing but a childish
translation from French; the words were changed but the syntax remained
the same. Even more probable is the view that the patient simply ranged
next to each other meaningless words that rang strangely, without any
true word-formation;[118] she borrowed certain characteristic sounds
from French and Italian and combined them into a kind of language,
just as Helen Smith completed the _lacunæ_ in the real Sanscrit words
by products of her own resembling that language. The curious names of
the mystical system can be reduced, for the most part, to known roots.
The writer vividly recalls the botanical schemes found in every school
atlas; the internal resemblance of the relationship of the planets to
the sun is also pretty clear; we shall not be going astray if we see in
the names reminiscences from popular astronomy. Thus can be explained
the names Persus, Fenus, Nenus, Sirum, Surus, Fixus, and Pix, as
the childlike distortions of Perseus, Venus, Sirius and Fixed Star,
analogous to the Vena variations. Magnesor vividly recalls Magnetism,
whose mystic significance the patient knew from the Prophetess of
Prevorst. In Connesor, the contrary to Magnesor, the prefix "con" is
probably the French "contre." Hypnos and Hyfonismus recall hypnosis
and hypnotism (German _hypnotismus_), about which there are the most
superstitious ideas circulating in lay circles. The most used suffixes
in "us" and "os" are the signs by which as a rule people decide the
difference between Latin and Greek. The other names probably spring
from similar accidents to which we have no clues. The rudimentary
glossolalia of our case has not any title to be a classical instance of
cryptomnesia, for it only consisted in the unconscious use of various
impressions, partly optical, party acoustic, and all very close at hand.

2. _The cryptomnesic image arrives at consciousness through the senses
(as a hallucination)._ Helen Smith is the classic example of this kind.
I refer to the case mentioned on the date "18 Mars."[119]

3. _The image arrives at consciousness by motor automatism._ H. Smith
had lost her valuable brooch, which she was anxiously looking for
everywhere. Ten days later her guide Leopold informed her by means
of the table where the brooch was. Thus informed, she found it at
night-time in the open field, covered by sand.[120] Strictly speaking,
in cryptomnesia there is not any additional creation in the true sense
of the word, since the conscious memory experiences no increase of its
function, but only an enrichment of its content. By the automatism
certain regions are merely made accessible to consciousness in an
indirect way, which were formerly sealed against it. But the unconscious
does not thereby accomplish any creation which exceeds the capacity of
consciousness qualitatively or quantitatively. Cryptomnesia is only an
apparent additional creation, in contrast to hypermnesia, which actually
represents an increase of function.[121]

We have spoken above of a receptivity of the unconscious greater
than that of the consciousness, chiefly in regard to the simple
attempts at thought-reading of numbers. As mentioned, not only our
somnambulist but a relatively large number of normal persons are able
to guess from the tremors lengthy thought-sequences, if they are not
too complicated. These experiments are, so to speak, the prototype
of those rarer and incomparably more astonishing cases of intuitive
knowledge displayed at times by somnambulists.[122] Zschokke[123] in
his "Introspection" has shown us that these phenomena do not belong
only to the domain of somnambulism, but occur among non-somnambulic
persons. The formation of such knowledge seems to be arrived at in
various ways: first and foremost there is the fineness, already noted,
of unconscious perceptions; then must be emphasised the importance of
the enormous suggestibility of somnambulists. _The somnambulist not
only incorporates every suggestive idea to some extent, but actually
lives in the suggestion, in the person of his doctor or observer,
with that abandonment characteristic of the suggestible hysteric._
The relation of Frau Hauffe to Kerner is a striking example of this.
That in such cases there is a high degree of _association-concordance_
can cause no astonishment; a condition which Richet might have taken
more account of in his experiments in thought-transference. Finally
there are cases of somnambulic additional creative work which are not
to be explained solely by hyperæsthesia of the unconscious activity
of the senses and association-concordance, but presuppose a highly
developed intellectual activity of the unconscious. The deciphering
of the purposive tremors demand an extreme sensitiveness and delicacy
of feeling, both psychological and physiological, to combine the
individual perceptions into a complete unity of thought, if it is at
all permissible to make an analogy between the processes of cognition
in the realm of the unconscious and the conscious. The possibility
must always be considered that _in the unconscious, feeling and concept
are not clearly separated_, perhaps even are one. The intellectual
elevation which certain somnambulists display in ecstasy, though a rare
thing, is none the less one that has sometimes been observed.[124] I
would designate the scheme composed by our patient as just one of those
pieces of creative work that exceed the normal intelligence. We have
already seen whence one portion of this scheme probably came. A second
source is no doubt the life-crisis of Frau Hauffe, portrayed in Kerner's
book. The external form seems to be determined by these adventitious
facts. As already observed in the presentation of the case, the idea of
dualism arises from the conversations picked up piecemeal by the patient
during those dreamy states occurring after her ecstasies. This exhausts
my knowledge of the sources of S. W.'s creations. Whence arose the
root-idea the patient is unable to say. I naturally examined occultistic
literature pertinent to the subject, and discovered a store of parallels
with her gnostic system from different centuries scattered through all
kinds of work mostly quite inaccessible to the patient. Moreover, at
her youthful age, and with her surroundings, the possibility of any
such study is quite excluded. A brief survey of the system in the light
of her own explanations shows how much intelligence was used in its
construction. How highly the intellectual work is to be estimated is a
matter of opinion. In any case, considering her youth, her mentality
must be regarded as quite extraordinary.

[Footnote 98: Thus Flournoy writes, "Dans un premier essai Léopold
(H.S.'s control-spirit) ne réussit qu'à donner ses intimations et sa
pronunciation à Helen: après une séance où elle avait vivement souffert
dans la bouche et le cou comme si on lui travaillait ou lui enlevait les
organes vocaux, elle se mit à causer très naturellement."]

[Footnote 99: Loewenfeld, _Arch. f. Psych._, XXIII., 60.]

[Footnote 100: This behaviour recalls Flournoy's observations: "Whilst
H.S. as a somnambule speaks as Marie Antoinette, the arms of H.S. do not
belong to the somnambulic personality, but to the automatism Leopold,
who converses by gestures with the observer" (Flournoy, _l.c._, p. 125).]

[Footnote 104: The hysterical attack is not a purely psychical process.
By the psychic processes only a pre-formed mechanism is set free, which
has nothing to do with psychic processes in and for themselves (Karplus,
_Jahr. f. Psych._, XVII.).]

[Footnote 105: Carl Hauptmann, in his drama "Die Bergschmiede," has
made use of the objectivation of certain linked association-complexes.
In this play the treasure-seeker is met on a gloomy night by a
hallucination of his entire better self.]

[Footnote 111: _Cryptomnesia_ must not be regarded as synonymous with
_Hypermnesia_; by the latter term is meant the abnormal quickening of
the power of recollection which reproduces the memory-pictures as such.]

[Footnote 112: "Has any one at the end of the nineteenth century any
clear conception of what the poets in vigorous ages called inspiration?
If not, I will describe it. The slight remnant of superstition by
itself would scarcely have sufficed to reject the idea of being merely
incarnation, merely mouthpiece, merely the medium of superior forces.
The concept revelation in the sense that quite suddenly, with ineffable
certainty and delicacy, something is seen, something is heard, something
convulsing and breaking into one's inmost self, does but describe
the fact. You hear--you do not seek; you accept--asking not who is
the giver. Like lightning, flashes the thought, compelling without
hesitation as to form--I have had no choice" (Nietzsche's "Works," vol.
III., p. 482.).]

[Footnote 113: "There is an ecstasy so great that the immense strain of
it is sometimes relaxed by a flood of tears, during which one's steps
now involuntarily rush, and anon involuntarily lag. There is the feeling
that one is utterly out of hand, with the very distinct consciousness of
an endless number of fine thrills and titillations descending to one's
very toes;--there is a depth of happiness in which the most painful and
gloomy parts do not act as antitheses to the rest, but are produced and
required as necessary shades of colour in such an overflow of light"
(Nietzsche, "Ecce Homo," vol. XVII. of English translation, by A. M.
Ludovici, p. 103).]

[Footnote 118: "Le baragouin rapide et confus dont on ne peut jamais
obtenir la signification, probablement parce qu'il n'en a en effet
aucune, n'est qu'un pseudo-langage (p. 193) analogue au baragouinage par
lequel les enfants se donnent parfois dans leurs jeux l'illusion qu'ils
parlent chinois, indien ou 'sauvage'" (p. 152, Flournoy, _l.c._).]

[Footnote 122: The limitation of the associative processes and the
concentration of attention upon a definite sphere of presentation can
also lead to the development of new ideas, which no effort of will
in the waking state would have been able to accomplish (Loewenfeld,
"Hypnotismus," p. 289).]

[Footnote 124: Gilles de la Tourette says, "We have seen somnambulic
girls, poor, uneducated, quite stupid in the waking state, whose whole
appearance altered so soon as they were sent to sleep. Whilst previously
they were boring, now they are lively, alert, sometimes even witty" (Cf.
Loewenfeld, _l.c._, p. 132).]
