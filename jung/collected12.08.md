## VIII

_From Dr. Jung._

    18th February, 1913.

I cannot but agree with your observation that confusion reigns in
psychoanalytic literature. Just at this moment different points of view
are developing in the theoretical conception of the analytic results;
not to mention many individual deviations. Over against Freud's almost
purely _causal_ conception, there has developed, apparently in absolute
contradiction, Adler's purely _final_ view, but in reality the latter
is an essential complement of Freud's theory. I hold rather to a middle
course, taking into account both standpoints. That discord still reigns
round the ultimate questions of psychoanalysis need not surprise us
when we consider the difficulty. The problem of the therapeutic effect
of psychoanalysis is bound up in particular with supremely difficult
questions, so that it would indeed be astonishing if we had yet
reached final certitude. Stekel's statement to which you refer is very
characteristic. What he says about love for the doctor is obviously
true, but it is a simple affirmation, and not a goal or plumb-line of
the analytic therapy. If his statement were the goal, many cures, it is
true, would be possible, but also many calamities might result which are
avoidable. But the aim is so to educate the patient that he will get
well for his own sake and by reason of his own determination, rather
than to procure his doctor some sort of advantage; though of course
it would be absurd from the therapeutic standpoint not to allow the
patient to get better because in doing so he does the doctor a good turn
also. It suffices if the patient knows it. But we must not prescribe
for him which path he should take to recovery. Naturally it seems to me
(from the psychoanalytic standpoint) an inadmissible use of suggestive
influence if the patient is compelled to get better out of love for
the doctor. And indeed such compulsion may sometimes take bitter
revenge. The "you must and shall be saved" is no more to be commended in
nerve-therapy than in any other department of life. It contradicts the
principle of analytic treatment, which shuns all coercion and desires
to let everything grow up from within. I do not, as you know, object to
influencing by use of suggestion in general, but merely to a doubtful
motivation. If the doctor demands that his patient shall get well from
love of himself, the patient may easily reckon on reciprocal services
and will without doubt try to extort them. I can but utter a warning
against any such method. A far stronger motive for recovery--also a far
healthier and ethically more valuable one--consists in the patient's
thorough insight into the real state of affairs, the recognition of how
things are now and how they ought to be. The man of any sort of worth
will then discern that he can hardly sit down at ease in the quagmire of
his neurosis.

With your rendering of what I said about the healing power of
personality I cannot entirely agree. I wrote that the doctor's
personality has a power for healing because the patient reads the
doctor's personality: not that he produces a cure through _love_ of the
doctor. The doctor cannot prevent the patient's beginning to behave
himself towards _his_ conflicts just as the doctor himself behaves,
for nothing is finer than a neurotic's intuition. _But every strong
transference serves this same purpose._ If the doctor makes himself
charming, he buys off from the patient a series of resistances which he
should have overcome, and whose overcoming will certainly have to be
gone through later on. Nothing is won by this technique; at most the
beginning of the analysis is made easy for the patient (though this is
not quite without its use in certain cases). To be able to crawl through
a barbed wire fence without some enticing end in view testifies to an
ascetic strength of will which you can expect neither from the ordinary
person nor from the neurotic. Even the Christian religion, whose moral
demands certainly reached a great height, thought it no scorn to
represent the near approach of the Kingdom of Heaven as goal and reward
of earthly pain. In my view, the doctor may well speak of the rewards
which follow the toils of analysis. But he must not depict himself or
his friendship, in hints or promises, as reward, if he is not seriously
determined to keep his word.

In regard to your criticism of my outline-definition of the conception
of psychoanalysis, it must be observed that the road over the steep
mountain is the line of least resistance only when a ferocious bull
waits for you in the pleasant valley-road. In other words, the line
of least resistance is a compromise with _all_ demands, and not
with inertia alone. It is prejudice to think that the line of least
resistance coincides with the path of inertia. (That's what we thought
in the days when we dawdled over Latin exercises.) Inertia is only an
immediate advantage and leads to consequences which produce the worst
resistances; as a whole, it does not lie in the direction of least
resistance. Life along the line of least resistance is not synonymous
with a man's regardless pursuit of his own egoistic desires. He who
lives thus soon painfully perceives that he is not moving along the line
of least resistance, for he is also a social being, and not merely a
bundle of egoistic instincts, as some people rather like to depict him.
This is best seen among primitive men and herd-animals, who all have a
richly developed social sense. Without it, indeed, the herd could not
exist at all. Man as herd-animal has therefore by no manner of means to
subject himself to laws enforced on him from without; he carries his
social imperatives within himself, _a priori_, as an inborn necessity.
As you see, I here put myself in decided opposition to certain views--I
think quite unjustified--which have been put forth here and there
inside the psychoanalytic movement.

So the line of least resistance does not signify _eo ipso_ the avoidance
of unpleasure so much as the just balancing of unpleasure and pleasure.
Painful activity by itself leads to no result but exhaustion. Man must
be able to take pleasure in his life, or the struggle of life has no
reward. What direction the patient's future life should take is not ours
to judge. We must not imagine we know better than his own nature--or
we prove ourselves educators of the worst kind. Psychoanalysis is but
a means of removing stones from the path, and in no way a method (as
hypnotism often pretends to be) of putting anything into the patient
which was not there before. So we renounce any attempt to give a
direction, and occupy ourselves only with setting in proper relief
all that analysis brings into the light of day, in order that the
patient may see clearly, and be in a position to draw the appropriate
conclusions. Anything that he has not himself won, he does not in
the long run believe in; and all that he has received from authority
keeps him still infantile. He must rather be put in such a position as
will enable him to take control of his own life. It is the art of the
psychoanalyst to follow the patient's apparently mistaken paths without
prejudice, and thus to discover his strayed and separated sheep. Working
on a system, according to a preconceived scheme, we spoil the best
results of the analysis. So I hold fast to the maxim you quote from me:
"Every interference on the part of the analyst is a gross mistake in
technique. So-called chance is the law and the order of psychoanalysis."

You surely recognise that the schoolmaster-view never releases us
from the attempt to correct Nature and the desire to force upon her
our limited "truths." In nerve-therapy we get so many wonderful
experiences--unforeseen and impossible to foresee--that surely we ought
to dismiss all hope of being infallibly able to point out the right
path. The roundabout way and even the wrong way are necessary. If you
deny this you must also deny that the errors in the history of the
whole world have been necessary. That indeed were a world-conception fit
for a schoolmaster. For psychoanalysis this view suits not at all.

The question as to how much the analyst involuntarily suggests to
the patient is a very ticklish one. Undoubtedly that has a much more
important place than psychoanalysts have till now admitted. Experience
has convinced us that the patient rapidly avails himself of the ideas
won through the analysis, and of whatever comes to light through the
shaping of the dreams. You may obtain all manner of such impressions
from Stekel's book: "Die Sprache des Traumes" ("The Language of the
Dream"). I had once a most instructive experience: a very intelligent
lady had from the beginning extreme transference phantasies which
appeared in well-recognised erotic forms. Nevertheless she entirely
declined to admit their existence. Of course she was betrayed by the
dreams in which my own person was hidden behind some other figure, and
often difficult to unveil. A long series of such dreams forced me at
last to say: "So you see it is always like that, and the person of whom
one has really dreamt is replaced and hidden by some one else in the
manifest dream." Till then the patient had obstinately contested this
point. But this time she could no longer evade it, and had to admit my
rule--but only that she might play me a trick. Next day she brought me a
dream in which she and I appeared in a manifest lascivious situation. I
was naturally perplexed and thought of my rule. Her first association to
the dream was the malicious question: "It's always true, isn't it, that
the person of whom one is really dreaming is replaced by some one else
in the manifest dream-content?"

Clearly, she had made use of her experience to find a protective formula
by means of which she secured the open expression of her phantasies in
an apparently innocent way.

This example aptly shows how patients avail themselves of insight
gained during analysis; they use it symbolically. You get caught in
your own net if you give credence to the idea of unalterable, permanent
symbols. That has already happened to more than one psychoanalyst. It
is therefore fallacious to try to prove any particular theory from the
dreams arising in the course of analysis. For this purpose the only
conclusive dreams are those derived from demonstrably uninfluenced
persons. In such cases one would only have to exclude the possibility of
telepathic thought-reading. But if you concede this possibility you will
have to subject very many things to a rigorous re-examination and, among
others, many judicial verdicts.

But although we must do full justice to the force of suggestion, we must
not overrate it. The patient is no empty sack into which you may stuff
whatever you like; on the contrary, he brings his own predetermined
contents which strive obstinately against suggestion and always obtrude
themselves afresh. Through analytic "suggestions," only the outward
_form_ is determined, never the content--this is always being freshly
impressed upon my notice. The form is the unlimited, the ever-changing;
but the content is fixed, and only to be assailed slowly and with great
difficulty. Were it not so, suggestion-therapy would be in every respect
the most effective, profitable, and easiest therapy,--a real panacea.
That, alas! it is not, as every honourable hypnotist will freely admit.

To return to your question as to how far it is conceivable that patients
may deceive the doctor by making use--perhaps involuntarily--of his
expressions: this is indeed a very serious problem. The analyst must
exercise all possible care and practise unsparing self-criticism if
he would avoid, as far as possible, being led into error by patients'
dreams. It may be admitted that they almost always use modes of
expression in their dreams learnt in analysis--some more, some less.
Interpretations of earlier symbols will themselves be used again as
fresh symbols in later dreams. It happens not seldom, for instance, that
sexual situations which appear in symbolic form in the earlier dreams,
will appear "undisguised" in later ones, and here again they are the
symbolic expression of ideas of another character capable of further
analysis. The not infrequent dream of incestuous cohabitation is by
no means an "undisguised" content, but a dream as freshly symbolic and
capable of analysis as all others. You surely only reach the paradoxical
view that such a dream is "undisguised" if you are pledged to the sexual
theory of neurosis.

That the patient may mislead the doctor for a longer or shorter time by
means of deliberate deception and misrepresentation is possible; just as
occasionally happens in all other departments of medicine. Therewith the
patient injures himself most, since he has to pay for every deception
or suppression, with aggravated or additional symptoms. Deceptions are
so obviously disadvantageous to himself that in the end he can scarcely
avoid the definite relinquishment of such a course.

The technique of analysis we can best postpone for oral discussion.
