## IV.--THE TWO TYPES OF PSYCHOLOGY.

It is at this point that our most recent researches may suitably be
introduced. We have found, in the first place, that there are two types
of human psychology.[235] In the one type the fundamental function is
feeling, and in the other it is thought. The one feels his way into
the object, the other thinks about it. The one adapts himself to his
surroundings by feeling, thinking coming later; whilst the other adapts
himself by means of thought, preceded by understanding. The one who
feels his way transfers himself to some extent to the object; whilst the
other withdraws himself from the object to some extent, or pauses before
it and reflects about it. The first we called the _extroverted_ type,
because in the main he goes outside himself to the object, the latter is
called the _introverted_ type, because in a major degree he turns away
from the object, withdrawing into himself and thinking about it.

These remarks only give the broadest outline of the two types. But
even this quite inadequate sketch enables us to recognise that the
two theories are the outcome of the contrast between the two types.
The sexual theory is promulgated from the standpoint of feeling, the
power theory from that of thought; for the extrovert always places the
accent upon the feelings that are connected with the object, whereas the
introvert always puts the accent upon the ego, and is as much detached
by thought from the object as possible.

_The irreconcilable contradictions of the two theories are now to
be understood, because both theories are the product of a one-sided
psychology._ We find an instance of the contrast of types in Nietzsche
and Wagner. The dissension between the two is due to the contrast in
their ideas of psychological values. What is most prized by the one is
"affectation" for the other, and is deemed false to the very core. Each
depreciates the other.

If we apply the sexual theory to an extrovert it tallies with the facts
of the case; but if we apply it to an introvert, we simply maltreat
and do violence to his psychology. The same applies to the contrary
case. The relative rightness of the two hostile theories is explained
by the fact that each one draws its material from cases that prove the
correctness of the theory. There is a remnant of persons whom neither
theory fits--has not every rule its exceptions?

Criticism of both theories is indispensable. Recognition of facts showed
the necessity of overcoming their contrast, and of evolving a theory
that should do justice not only to one or the other type, but equally to
both.

Even the layman will to some extent have been struck by the fact that in
spite of their correctness both theories really have a very unpleasant
character and one not altogether pertinent under all circumstances
to the strict views of science. The sexual theory is un√¶sthetic and
unsatisfying intellectually. The power theory, on the other hand, is
decidedly venomous. Both inevitably reduce high-flown ideals, heroic
attitudes, pathos, and deep convictions, in a painful manner to a
reality which is hackneyed and trite; that is, if these theories are
applied to such things--but they should certainly not be so applied.
Both theories are really only therapeutic instruments out of the
tool-chest of the physician, whose sharp and merciless knife cuts out
all that is pernicious and diseased. It was just such a misapplication
of theory Nietzsche tried with his destructive criticism of ideals.
He regarded ideals as rampant diseases of the soul of humanity; as
indeed they really are. However, in the hands of a good physician who
really knows the human soul, who, as Nietzsche says, "has a finger
for the slightest shade," who applies the treatment only to what is
really diseased in a soul--in such hands both theories prove wholesome
caustics. The application must be adapted to the individual case. It is
a dangerous therapy in the hands of those who do not understand how to
deal out the treatment. These applications of criticism do good when
there is something that should and must be destroyed, dissolved or
brought low, but can easily damage what is being built up, or growing in
response to life's requirements.

Both theories might, therefore, be allowed to pass without attack, in
so far as they, like medicinal poisons, are entrusted to the safe hands
of the physician. But fate has ordained that they should not remain
solely in the care of those who are qualified to use them. First of all
they naturally became known to the medical public. Every practising
physician has an indefinitely high percentage of neurotics among his
patients; he is therefore more or less obliged to look out for new and
suitable systems of treatment. He ultimately lights upon the difficult
method of psychoanalysis. He is at first not competent for this, for how
should he have learnt about the secrets of the human soul? Certainly
not through his academic studies. The smattering of psychiatry that he
acquired for his examination barely suffices to enable him to recognise
the symptoms of the commonest mental disturbances, and is far from
giving him any sufficient insight into the human soul. He is, therefore,
practically quite unprepared to apply the analytic method. An unusually
far-reaching knowledge of the soul is indeed necessary in order to be
able to apply this caustic treatment with advantage. One must be in
a position to differentiate elements that are diseased and should be
discarded, from those which are valuable and should be retained. This
is plainly a matter of great difficulty. Any one who wishes to get a
vivid impression of the way in which a psychologysing physician may
unwarrantably violate a patient through an ignoble pseudo-scientific
prejudice, should read what Moebius has written about Nietzsche. Or he
may study various psychiatric writings about the "case of Christ," and
will surely not hesitate to lament the lot of the patient whose fate it
is to meet with such "understanding." Psychoanalysis--greatly to the
regret of the medical man who, however, had not accepted it--then passed
over into the hands of the teaching profession. This is right: for it is
really, when rightly understood and handled, an educational method, and
one of the social sciences. I would, however, never personally recommend
that Freud's purely sexual analysis should be exclusively applied as an
educational method. It might do much harm because of its one-sidedness.
In order to make psychoanalysis available for educational purposes, all
the metamorphoses that have been the work of the last few years were
needed. The method had to be expanded from a general psychological point
of view.

But the two theories of which I have spoken are not general theories.
They are, as I have said, caustics to be applied, so to say, "locally,"
for they are both destructive and reductive. They explain to the patient
that his symptoms come from here or there, and are "nothing but" this or
that. It would be very unjust to wish to maintain that this reductive
theory is wrong in a given case, but when exalted into a general
explanation of the nature of the soul--whether sick or healthy--_a
reductive theory becomes impossible_. For the human soul, whether it be
sick or healthy, cannot be _merely_ reductively explained. Sexuality
it is true is always and everywhere present; the instinct for power
certainly does penetrate the heights and the depths of the soul; but
the soul itself is not solely either the one or the other, or even both
together, it is also that which it has made and will make out of them
both. A person is only half understood when one knows how everything
in him came about. Only a dead man can be explained in terms of the
past, a living one must be otherwise explained. Life is not made up
of yesterdays only, nor is it understood nor explained by reducing
to-day to yesterday. Life has also a to-morrow, and to-day is only
understood if we are able to add the indications of to-morrow to our
knowledge of what was yesterday. This holds good for all expressions of
psychological life, even for symptoms of disease. Symptoms of neurosis
are not merely consequences of causes that once have been, whether they
were "infantile sexuality" or "infantile instinct for power." They are
endeavours towards a new synthesis of life. It must immediately be
added, however, they are endeavours that have miscarried. None the less
they are attempts; they represent the germinal striving which has both
meaning and value. They are embryos that failed to achieve life, owing
to unpropitious conditions of an internal and external nature.

The reader will now probably propound the question: What possible value
and meaning can a neurosis have? Is it not a most useless and repulsive
pest of humanity? Can being nervous do anybody good? Possibly, in a way
similar to that of flies and other vermin, which were created by God
in order that man might exercise the useful virtue of patience. Stupid
as this thought is from the standpoint of natural science, it might be
quite shrewd from that of psychology; that is, if we substitute "nervous
symptoms" in the place of "vermin." Even Nietzsche, who had an uncommon
disdain for anything stupid and trite in thought, more than once
acknowledged how much he owed to his illness. I have known more than one
person who attributed all his usefulness, and the justification for his
existence even, to a neurosis, that hindered all decisive stupidities
of his life, _compelling_ him to lead an existence which developed what
was valuable in him; material that would have been crushed had not the
neurosis with its iron grip forced the man to keep to the place where
he really belonged. There are people the meaning of whose life--whose
real significance--lies in the unconscious; in consciousness lies only
all that is vain and delusive. With others the reverse is the case, and
for them the neurosis has another significance. An extended reduction is
appropriate to the one, but emphatically unsuitable to the other.

The reader will now, indeed, be inclined to agree to the possibility
of certain cases of neurosis having such a significance but will
nevertheless be ready to deny an expediency that is so far-reaching
and full of meaning to ordinary cases of this illness. What value, for
instance, might there be in the afore-mentioned case of asthma and
hysterical attacks of fear? I confess that the value here is not so
obvious, especially if the case be looked at from the standpoint of a
reductive theory, that is, from that of a _chronique scandaleuse_ of the
psychological development of an individual.

We perceive that both the theories hitherto discussed have this one
point in common, viz. they relentlessly disclose everything that is
valueless in people. They are theories, or rather hypotheses, which
explain wherein the cause of the sickness lies. They are accordingly
concerned not with the _values_ of a person, but with his lack of value
that makes itself evident in a disturbing way. From this point of view,
it is possible to be reconciled to both standpoints.

A "value" is a possibility by means of which energy may attain
development. But in so far as a negative value is also a possibility
through which energy may attain development--as may, for instance,
be clearly seen in the very considerable manifestations of energy
shown in neurosis--it also stands for a value, albeit it brings about
manifestations of energy which are useless and harmful. In itself energy
is neither useful nor harmful, neither full of value nor lacking in it;
it is indifferent, everything depending upon the _form_ into which it
enters. The form gives the quality to the energy. On the other side,
mere form without energy is also indifferent. Therefore in order to
bring about a positive value, on the one hand energy is necessary,
and upon the other a valuable form. In a neurosis psychic energy is
undoubtedly present, but in an inferior and not realisable form. Both
the analytic methods that have been discussed above are of service only
as solvents of this inferior form. They prove themselves good here as
caustics.

By these methods we gain energy that is certainly free, but which, being
as yet unapplied, is indifferent. Hitherto the supposition prevailed,
that this newly acquired energy was at the patient's conscious disposal,
that he might apply it in any way he liked. In so far as it was thought
that the energy was nothing but the sexual impulse, people spoke of
a sublimated application of the same, under the presumption that the
patient could, without further ado, transfer what was thought of as
sexual energy into a "sublimation"; that is, into a non-sexual form
of use. It might, for instance, be transferred to the cultivation of
an art, or to some other good or useful activity. According to this
concept, the patient had the possibility of deciding, either arbitrarily
or from inclination, how his energy should be sublimated.

This conception may be accorded a justification for its existence, in
so far as it is at all possible for a human being to assign a definite
direction to his life, in which its course should run. But we know that
there is no human forethought nor philosophy which can enable us to give
our lives a prescribed direction, except for quite a short distance.
Destiny lies before us, perplexing us, and teeming with possibilities,
and yet only one of these many possibilities is our own particular right
way. Who should presume to designate the one possibility beforehand,
even though he have the most complete knowledge of his own character
that a man can have? Much can certainly be attained by means of
will-power. But having regard to the fate of certain personalities with
particularly strong wills, it is entirely misleading for us to want
at all costs to change our own fate by power of will. Our will is a
function that is directed by our _powers of reflection_; it depends,
therefore, upon how our powers of reflection are constituted. In order
to deserve its name reflection must be _rational_, that is, according
to reason. But has it ever been proved, or can it ever be proved, that
life and destiny harmonise with our human reason, that is, that they
are exclusively rational? On the contrary, we have ground for supposing
that they are also irrational, that is to say, that in the last resort
they too are based in regions beyond the human reason. The irrationality
of the great process is shown by its so-called _accidentalness_, which
perforce we ought to deny, since, obviously, we cannot think of a
process not being causally and necessarily conditioned. But actually,
accidentality exists everywhere, and does so indeed so obtrusively that
we might as well pocket our causal philosophy! The rich store of life
both is, and is not, determined by law; it is at the same time rational
and irrational. Therefore, the reason and the will founded upon it are
only valid for a short distance. The further we extend this rationally
chosen direction, the surer we may be that we are thereby excluding the
irrational possibilities of life, which have, however, just as good
a right to be lived. Aye, we even injure ourselves, since we cut off
the wealth of accidental eventualities by a too rigid and conscious
direction. It was certainly very expedient for man to be able to give
his life a direction; it would, therefore, be quite right to maintain
that the attainment of reasonableness was the greatest achievement of
mankind. But that is not to say that under all circumstances, this must
or will always continue to be the case. The present fearful catastrophic
world-war has tremendously upset the most optimistic upholder of
rationalism and culture.

In 1913 Ostwald wrote[236] as follows: "The whole world agrees that the
present state of armed peace is untenable, and is gradually becoming an
impossible condition. It demands tremendous sacrifices from individual
nations far surpassing the outlay for cultural purposes, without any
positive values being gained thereby. Therefore, if mankind could
discover ways and means of putting an end to these preparations for a
war _that will never come_, this conscripting of a considerable part
of the nation at the best and most capable age for training for war
purposes, if it could overcome all the innumerable other injuries caused
by the present customs, such an enormous saving of energy would be
effected, that an undreamt-of development of the evolution of culture
might be expected. For like a hand-to-hand fight, war is the oldest, and
also the most unsuitable of all possible means of solving a conflict
between wills, being indeed accompanied by the most deplorable waste of
energy. The complete setting aside of potential as well as of actual
warfare is, therefore, absolutely one of the most important tasks of
culture in our time, a real necessity from the point of view of energy."

But the irrationality of destiny ordained otherwise than the rationality
of the well-meaning thinker; since it not only determined to use the
piled-up weapons and soldiers, but much more than that, it brought about
a tremendous insane devastation and unparalleled slaughter. From this
catastrophe humanity may possibly draw the conclusion, that only one
side of fate can be mastered by rational intention.

What can be said of mankind in general applies also to individuals, for
mankind as a whole consists of nothing but individuals. And whatever
the psychology of mankind is, that is also the psychology of the
individual. We are experiencing in the world-war a fearful balancing-up
with the rational intentionality of organised culture. What is called
"will" in the individual, is termed "imperialism" among nations, for
the will is a demonstration of power over fate, that is, exclusion
of what is accidental. The organisation of culture is a rational and
"expedient" sublimation of free and indifferent energies, brought about
by design and intention. The same is the case in the individual. And
just as the hope of a universal international organisation of culture
has experienced a cruel right-about through this war, so also must
the individual, in the course of his life, often find that so-called
"disposable" energies do not suffer themselves to be disposed of.

I was once consulted by a business man of about forty-five, whose case
is a good illustration of the foregoing. He was a typical American
self-made man, who had worked himself up from the bottom. He had been
successful, and had founded a very extensive business. He had also
gradually organised the business in such a way that he could now retire
from its management. He had indeed resigned two years before I saw him.
Until then he had only lived for his business, concentrating all his
energy upon it, with that incredible intensity and one-sidedness that is
so peculiar to the successful American man of business. He had bought
himself a splendid country seat, where he thought he would "live,"
which he imagined to mean keeping horses, automobiles, playing golf and
tennis, attending and giving parties, etc. But he had reckoned without
his host. The energy that had become "disposable" did not enter into
these tempting prospects, but betook itself capriciously to quite other
ways. A couple of weeks after the commencement of his longed-for life
of bliss, he began to brood over peculiar vague physical sensations. A
few more weeks sufficed to plunge him into an unprecedented state of
hypochondria. His nerves broke down completely. He, who was physically
an uncommonly strong and exceptionally energetic man, became like a
whining child. And that put an end to all his paradise. He fell from
one apprehension to another, worrying himself almost to death. He
then consulted a celebrated specialist, who immediately perceived
quite rightly that there was nothing wrong with the man but lack of
employment. The patient saw the sense of this, and betook himself to
his former position. But to his great disappointment no interest for
his business presented itself. Neither the application of patience nor
determination availed to help. His energy would not by any means be
forced back into the business. His condition naturally became worse than
before. Energy that hitherto had been actively creative was now turned
back into himself, with fearfully destructive force. His creative genius
rose up, so to speak, in revolt against him, and instead of, as before,
producing great organisations in the world, his demon now created
equally clever systems of hypochondriac fallacies, by which the man was
absolutely crushed. When I saw him, he was already a hopeless moral
ruin. I tried to make clear to him that such a gigantic amount of energy
might indeed be withdrawn from business, but the problem remained as
to where it should go. The finest horses, the fastest automobiles, and
the most amusing parties are in themselves no inducement for energy,
although it is certainly quite rational to think that a man who has
devoted his whole life to serious work, has a natural right to enjoy
himself. This would necessarily be the case if things happened "humanly"
in destiny; first would come work, then well-earned leisure. But things
happen irrationally and inconveniently enough, energy requires a
congenial channel, otherwise it is dammed up and becomes destructive. My
arguments met with no response, as was indeed to be expected. Such an
advanced case can only be taken care of till death; it cannot be cured.

This case clearly illustrates the fact that it does not lie in our power
to transfer a "disposable" energy to whatever rationally chosen object
we may like. Exactly the same may be said of those apparently available
energies that are made available by the fact that the psychoanalytical
caustic has destroyed their unsuitable forms. These energies can be
arbitrarily applied, as has already been said, at the very most only
for a short time. They resist following the rationally presented
possibilities for any length of time. Psychic energy is indeed a
fastidious thing, that insists upon having its own conditions fulfilled.
There may be ever so much energy existing, but we cannot make it useful,
so long as we do not succeed in finding a congenial channel for it.

The whole of my research work for the last years has been concentrated
upon this question. The _first stage_ of this work was to discover
the extent to which the two theories discussed above were tenable.
The _second stage_ consisted in the recognition of the fact, that
these two theories correspond to two opposite psychological types,
which I have designated the introversion and the extroversion types.
William James[237] was struck by the existence of these two types
among thinkers. He differentiated them as the "tough-minded," and
the "tender-minded." Similarly, Ostwald[238] discovered an analogous
difference in the classical and romantic types among great scholars.
I am not therefore alone in my ideas about the types, as is testified
by mentioning only these two well-known names out of many others.
Historical researches have proved to me that not a few of the great
controversies in the history of thought were based upon the contrast
between the types. The most significant case of this kind is the
contrast between nominalism and realism, which, beginning with the
difference between the Platonic and the Megarian schools, descended
to scholastic philosophy, where Abelard won the immortal distinction
of at least having ventured an attempt to unite the two contradictory
standpoints in conceptualism. This conflict has continued down to the
present day, where it finds expression in the antagonism of spiritualism
and materialism.

Just as in the general history of thought, so too every individual has
a share in this contrast of types. Close investigation proves that
people of opposite types have an unconscious predilection for marrying
each other, that they may mutually complement one another. Each type
has one function that is specially well developed, the introvert using
his thought as the function of adaptation, thinking beforehand about
how he shall act; whilst the extrovert, on the contrary, feels his way
into the object by acting. To some extent he acts beforehand. Hence
by daily application the one has developed his thought, and the other
his feeling. In extreme cases the one limits himself to thinking and
observing, and the other to feeling and acting. It is true that the
introvert feels also, very deeply indeed, almost too deeply; that is
why an English investigator[239] has gone so far as to describe his as
"the emotional type." True, the emotion is there, but it all remains
inside, and the more passionate and deeper his feeling is, the quieter
is his outward demeanour. As the proverb puts it, "Still waters run
deep." Similarly, the extrovert _thinks_ also, but that likewise mostly
inside, whilst his feelings visibly go outside, that is why he is held
to be full of feeling whilst the introvert is considered cold and dry.
But as the feeling of the thinker goes inwards, it is not developed as
a function adapted to external situations, but remains in a relatively
undeveloped state. Similarly the thinking of one who feels remains also
relatively undeveloped.

But if comparatively well-adapted individuals are under consideration,
then the introvert will normally be found to have his feeling directed
outwards, and the result may be extraordinarily deceptive. He shows
feelings; he is amiable, sympathetic, even emotional. But a critical
examination of the expressions of his feelings reveals that they are
markedly conventional. They are not individualised. He shows to every
one, without any essential difference, the same friendliness and the
same sympathy; whilst the extrovert's expressions of feeling are
throughout delicately graded and individualised. With the introvert
the expression of feelings is really a gesture that is artificially
adopted and conventional. Similarly, the extrovert may apparently
think, and that even very clearly and scientifically. But upon closer
investigation, his thoughts are found to be really foreign property,
merely conventional forms which have been artificially acquired. They
lack anything individual and original, and are just as lukewarm and
colourless as the conventional feelings of the introvert. Under these
conventional disguises, quite other things are slumbering in both, which
occasionally when awakened by some overpowering effect, suddenly break
out to the astonishment and horror of the environment.

Most civilised people incline more to one type than the other. Taken
together they would supplement each other exceedingly well. That is why
they are so apt to marry one another, and so long as they are fully
occupied with adapting themselves to the necessities of life they suit
one another splendidly. But if the man has earned a competence, or if
a big legacy drop from the sky, terminating the external urgencies of
life, then they have time to occupy themselves with each other. Until
now they stood back to back, defending themselves against want. But
now they turn to each other expecting to understand one another; and
they make the discovery that they have never understood one another.
They speak different languages. Thus the conflict between the two types
of psychology begins. This conflict is venomous, violent and full of
mutual depreciation, even if it be conducted very quietly in the utmost
intimacy. _This is so because the value of the one is the worthlessness
of the other._ The one, starting from the standpoint of his valuable
thinking, takes for granted that the feelings of the other correspond
to his own inferior feelings, this because he knows absolutely nothing
of any other feelings. But the other, starting from the standpoint of
his valuable feelings, assumes that his partner has the same inferior
thought that he himself has. Evidently there is plenty of work here for
Goethe's Homunculus, who had to find out "why husband and wife get on so
badly." Now as many cases of neurosis have a basis in such differences,
I, as a physician, found myself obliged to relieve the Homunculus of
some of his ungrateful task. I am glad to be able to say that many a
sufferer has been helped in grave difficulties by the enlightenment I
could give.

The _third stage_ of the path of increasing understanding consisted
in formulating a theory of the psychology of types which would be of
practical use for the development of man. Viewed from the newly-gained
standpoint, there resulted, first of all, _a totally new theory of
psychogenic disturbances_.

The foundation of the facts remains the same: the first hypothesis of
every neurosis is the existence of an unconscious conflict. According to
Freud's theory, this is an erotic conflict, or to speak more exactly,
a battle of the moral consciousness against the unconscious infantile
sexual world of phantasy and its transference to external objects.
According to Adler's theory, it is a battle of the superiority of the
ego against all oppressive influences, whether from inside or outside.

But the new idea asserts that _the neurotic conflict always takes
place between the adapted function and the co-function that is
undifferentiated, and that lies to a great extent in the unconscious_;
therefore in the case of the introvert, between thought and unconscious
feeling, but in that of the extrovert, between feeling and unconscious
thought.[240] Another theory of the etiological moment results from
this. If a man who naturally adapts himself by thinking is faced by
a demand that cannot be met by thinking alone, but which requires
differentiated feeling, the traumatic or pathogenic conflict breaks
out. On the contrary, the critical moment comes to the man who adapts
by feeling when he is faced by a problem requiring differentiated
thought. The afore-mentioned case of the business man is a clear
example of this. The man was an introvert, who all through his life
had left every consideration of sentiment in the background, that is,
in the unconscious. But when, for the first time in his life, he found
himself in a situation in which nothing could be done except by means
of differentiated feeling, he failed utterly. At the same time, a very
instructive phenomenon occurred; his unconscious feelings manifested
themselves as _physical sensations_ of a vague nature. This fact
harmonises with a generally accepted experience in our psychology,
to wit, that undeveloped feelings partake of the character of vague
physical sensations, since undifferentiated feelings are as yet
identical with subjective physical sensations. Differentiated feelings
are of a more "abstract" objective nature. This phenomenon may well
be the unconscious basis of the earliest statement of psychological
types that is known to me; namely, the three types of the Valentinian
School. They held the undifferentiated type to be the so-called hylic
(material) man. He was ranked below the differentiated types, that is,
the psychic (soulful) man, who corresponds to the extroversion type;
and the pneumatic (spiritual) man, who corresponds to the introversion
type. For these gnostics the "pneumatikos" stood of course the highest.
Christianity, with its "psychic" (spiritual) nature (principle of love),
has indeed contested this privilege of the gnosis. But even this page
may be turned in the course of time: since, if the signs of the age are
not deceptive, we are now in the great final settlement of the Christian
epoch. We know that, evolution not being uniformly continuous, when one
form of creation has been outlived, the evolutionary tendency harks
back to resume that form which, after having made a beginning, was left
behind in an undeveloped state.

After this brief digression to generalities, let us return to our case.
If a similar disturbance were to take place in an extrovert, he would
have what are called hysterical symptoms, that is, symptoms that are
also of an apparently physical nature, which, as our theory indicates,
would this time represent the patient's unconscious undifferentiated
thought. As a matter of fact, we find also a widespread region of
phantasy as the basis of hysterical symptoms, of which many have
been described in detail in the literature of the subject. They are
phantasies of a pronounced sexual, that is physical complexion. But in
reality they are undifferentiated thoughts, which in common with the
undifferentiated feelings are to some extent physical, and therefore
appear as what may be called physical symptoms.

By taking up again here the thread that was dropped before, we can now
clearly see why it is precisely in the neurosis that those values which
are most lacking to the individual lie hidden. We might also now return
to the case of the young woman, and apply to it the newly-won insight.
She is an extrovert with an hysterical neurosis. Let us suppose that
this patient had been "analysed," that is, that the treatment having
made it clear to her what kind of unconscious thoughts lay behind her
symptoms, she had regained possession of the psychic energy which by
becoming unconscious had constituted the strength of the symptoms. The
following practical question now arises: what can be done with the
so-called available energy? It would be rational, and in accordance
with the psychological type of the invalid, to extrovert this energy
again, that is to transfer it to an object, as for instance to
philanthropic or some other useful activities. This way is possible only
in exceptional cases--there are energetic natures who do not shrink from
care and trouble in a useful cause, there are people who care immensely
about just such occupations--otherwise it is not feasible. For it must
not be forgotten, that in the case under consideration, the libido (that
is the technical expression for the psychic energy) has found its object
already unconsciously in the young Italian, or an appropriate real human
substitute. Under these circumstances such a desirable sublimation,
however natural, is out of the question. For the object of the energy
usually affords a better channel than an ethical activity, however
attractive. Unfortunately there are many people who always speak of a
person, not as he is, but as he would be if their desires for him were
realised. But the physician is necessarily concerned with the actual
personality, which will obdurately remain the same, until its real
character has been recognised on all sides. An analysis must necessarily
be based upon the recognition of naked reality, not upon any arbitrarily
selected phantasies about a person, however desirable.

The fact is that the so-called available energy unfortunately cannot be
arbitrarily directed as desired. It follows its own channel, one which
it had already found, even before we had quite released it from its
bondage to the unadapted form. For we now make the discovery that the
phantasies which were formerly occupied with the young Italian, have
been transferred to the physician himself. The physician has therefore
himself become the object of the unconscious libido. If this is not
the case, or if the patient will on no account acknowledge the fact of
transference, or again, if the physician either does not understand the
phenomenon at all, or does so wrongly, then violent resistances make
their appearance, which aim at completely breaking off relations with
the doctor. At this point patients leave and look for another doctor or
for people who "understand" them; or if they hopelessly relinquish this
search they go to pieces.

But if the transference to the physician takes place and is accepted,
a natural channel has thereby been found, which not only replaces the
former, but also makes a discharge of the energic process possible, and
provides a course that is relatively free from conflict. Therefore if
the libido is allowed its natural course, it will of its own accord find
its way into the transference. Where this is not the case, it is always
a question either of arbitrary rebellion against the laws of Nature, or
of some deficiency in the physician's work.
