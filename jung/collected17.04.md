## III.--THE OTHER VIEWPOINT: THE WILL TO POWER.

We have so far considered the problem of the psychology of unconscious
processes mainly from the point of view of Freud. We have thereby
doubtless gained an inkling of a real truth, which perhaps our pride,
our consciousness of civilisation, tries to deny, although something
else in us affirms it. This situation is extremely irritating to
some people, arousing resistances, and at the same time they are
terror-stricken by it, a fact which they are most unwilling to
acknowledge. There is something terrible in admitting this conflict,
for it is an acknowledgment of being swayed by instinct. Has it ever
been understood what it means to confess to the sway of instinct?
Nietzsche desired to be so swayed and advocated it most seriously. He
even sacrificed himself throughout his whole life, with rare passion, to
the idea of the Superman, that is to the idea of the man who, obeying
his instincts, transcends even his very self. And what was the course of
his life? It turned out as Nietzsche himself prophesied in the passage
in "Zarathustra" relating to the fatal fall of the rope-dancer, of the
man who did not want to be "surpassed." Zarathustra says to the dying
rope-dancer: "Thy soul will be dead even sooner than thy body." And
later, the dwarf says to Zarathustra: "Oh, Zarathustra, thou stone of
wisdom! Thou threwest thyself high, but every thrown-stone must fall!
Condemned of thyself, and to thine own stoning: oh, Zarathustra, far
indeed threwest thou the stone--but upon _thyself_ will it recoil!"

When he cried his "ecce homo" over himself, it was again too late, and
the crucifixion of the soul began even before the body was dead. He
who thus taught _yea-saying_ to the instincts of life, must have his
own career looked at critically, in order to discover the effects of
this teaching upon the teacher. But if we consider his life from this
point of view, we must say that Nietzsche lived _beyond instinct_, in
the lofty atmosphere of heroic "sublimity." This height could only be
maintained by means of most careful diet, choice climate and above all
by many opiates. Finally, the tension of this living shattered his
brain. He spoke of yea-saying, but lived the nay. His horror of people,
especially of the animal man, who lives by instinct, was too great. He
could not swallow the toad of which he so often dreamt, and which he
feared he must yet gulp down. The Zarathustrian lion roared all the
"higher" men, who craved for life, back into the cavernous depths of the
unconscious. That is why his life does not convince us of the truth of
his teaching. The "higher man" should be able to sleep without chloral,
and be competent to live in Naumburg or Basle despite "the fogs and
shadows." He wants woman and offspring; he needs to feel he has some
value and position in the herd, he longs for innumerable commonplaces,
and not least for what is humdrum: it is this instinct that Nietzsche
did not recognise; it is, in other words, the natural animal instinct
for life.

But how did he live if it was not from natural impulse? Should Nietzsche
really be accused of a practical denial of his natural instincts? He
would hardly agree to that; indeed he might even prove, and that without
difficulty, that he really was following his instincts in the highest
sense. But we may well ask how is it possible that human instincts
could have led him so far from humanity, into absolute isolation,
into an aloofness from the herd which he supported with loathing and
disgust? One would have thought that instinct would have united, would
have coupled and begot, that it would tend towards pleasure and good
cheer, towards gratification of all sensual desires. But we have quite
overlooked the fact that this is only one of the possible directions
of instinct. There exists not only the instinct for the preservation
of the species (the sexual instinct), but also the instinct for the
preservation of the self.

Nietzsche obviously speaks of this latter instinct, that is of _the
will to power_. Whatever other kinds of instinct may exist are for him
only a consequence of the will to power. Viewed from the standpoint
of Freud's sexual-psychology this is a gross error, a misconception
of biology, a bad choice made by a decadent neurotic human being. For
it would be easy for any adherent of sexual psychology to prove that
all that was too lofty, too heroic, in Nietzsche's conception of the
world and of life, was nothing but a consequence of the repression
and misconception of "instinct," that is of the instinct that _this_
psychology considers fundamental.

This brings us to the _question of perception_, or rather it were
better to say of the various lenses through which the world may be
perceived. For it would hardly be permissible to pronounce a judgment
on a life like Nietzsche's. It was lived with rare consistency, from
the beginning to the fateful end, in accordance with his underlying
natural fundamental instinct for power. It would hardly do to pronounce
it to be merely figurative, otherwise we should make the same unjust
condemnation that Nietzsche pronounced upon his polar opposite Richard
Wagner, of whom he said, "_Everything in him is false_; what is genuine
is hidden or disguised. He is an actor, in every bad and good meaning
of the word." Why this judgment? Wagner is a precise representative of
that other fundamental instinct, which Nietzsche overlooked, and upon
which Freud's psychology is based. If we inquire whether the other main
instinct--that of power--was unconsidered by Freud, we shall find that
he has included it under the name of the "ego instinct." But these ego
instincts drag out an obscure existence, according to his psychology,
alongside the broad, all-too-broad, development of the sexual theme.
In reality, however, human nature wages a cruel and hardly-to-be-ended
warfare between the ego-principle and that of formless instinct. The ego
is all barriers; instinct, on the other hand, is without any limits.
Both principles are equally powerful. In a certain sense men may account
themselves fortunate in being conscious of only one instinct: therefore
he who is wise avoids getting to know the other. But if, after all,
he does get to know the other instinct, he is indeed a lost man. For
then he enters upon the Faustian conflict. Goethe has shown us in the
first part of "Faust" what the acceptance of instinct involves, and in
the second part, what the acceptance of the ego and of his gruesome
unconscious world would signify. Everything that is insignificant,
_petty_, and cowardly in us shrinks from it, and would avoid it--and
there is one admirable means of doing so. Namely, by discovering that
the other thing in us is "another fellow," a live man who actually
thinks, feels, does and desires all the things that are despicable
and odious. In this way the bogey is seized, and the battle against
him is begun to our satisfaction. Hence arise, also, those chronic
idiosyncrasies of which the history of morals has preserved a few
examples for us. The instance of Nietzsche contra Wagner, already cited,
is particularly transparent. But ordinary human life is crammed full of
such cases. It is by these ingenuous devices that man saves himself from
the Faustian catastrophe for which he evidently lacks both courage and
strength. But a sincere man knows that even his bitterest opponent, or
any number of them, does not by any means equal his one worst adversary,
that is his other self who "bides within his breast." Nietzsche
unconsciously had Wagner _in himself_, that is why he envied him his
Parsifal. But even worse, he was a Saul and also had Paul within. That
is why Nietzsche became a stigmatised outcast of the Spirit; he had like
Saul to experience Christification when "the other self" inspired him
with his "ecce homo." Which man in him "broke down before the cross,"
Wagner or Nietzsche?

It was ordained by destiny that one of Freud's earliest pupils,
Adler,[234] should formulate a view of neurosis as founded exclusively
upon the principle of power. It is interesting and even fascinating to
observe how totally different the same things appear when viewed in
another light. In order to emphasise the main contrast, I would like at
once to draw attention to the fact that, according to Freud, everything
is a strictly causal consequence of previously-occurring facts; Adler,
on the contrary, sees everything as a finally conditioned arrangement.
To take a simple example: A young woman begins to have attacks of
terror. She wakes at night from some nightmare with a piercing cry;
calming herself with difficulty, she clings to her husband, imploring
him not to leave her, making him repeat again and again that he loves
her, etc. Gradually a nervous asthma develops, attacks of which also
come on during the day.

In such a case, the Freudian system begins at once to burrow in the
inner causality of the illness: What did the initial anxiety-dreams
contain. She recalls wild bulls, lions, tigers, bad men. What does the
patient associate with them? She told a story of something that had
happened to her when she was still single. It ran as follows: She was
staying at a summer-resort in the mountains, a great deal of tennis
was played, the usual acquaintances being made. There was a young
Italian who played particularly well, and who also knew how to handle
the guitar in the evenings. A harmless flirtation developed, leading
once to a moon-light walk. On this occasion, the Italian temperament
"unexpectedly" broke through, running away with the young man to the
great terror of the unsuspecting girl. He "looked at her with such a
look," that she could never forget it. This look follows her even in
her dreams; the wild animals that persecuted her had it. As a matter
of fact, does this look originally come from the Italian? Another
reminiscence enlightens us. The patient had lost her father through an
accident, when she was about fourteen years old. The father was a man
of the world, and travelled a great deal. Not long before his death
he took her to Paris, where, among other things, they visited the
_Follies Bergères_. Something happened there that at the time made a
deep impression upon her. As they were leaving the theatre, a rouged
female suddenly pressed close up to her father in an impertinent way.
She looked at her father in fear as to what he would do--and then she
saw that look, that animal glare in his eyes. An inexplicable something
clung to her day and night. From this moment her attitude to her father
was quite changed. At one instant she was irritable and full of venomous
moods, at another she loved him extravagantly; then causeless fits of
crying suddenly began, and, for a time, whenever her father was at home,
she was tormented by terrible choking at table, with apparent attacks of
suffocation, which were usually followed by voicelessness lasting from
one to two days. When the news of her father's sudden death arrived, she
was overcome by uncontrolled grief ending in hysterical laughter. But
she soon calmed down, her condition improving quickly, and the neurotic
symptoms disappearing almost completely. It seemed as if a veil of
forgetfulness had descended over the past. Only the experience with the
Italian roused something in her of which she was afraid. She had broken
off completely with the young man. A few years later she married. The
present neurosis only began after the birth of her second child, that is
at the moment when she discovered that her husband took a certain tender
interest in another woman.

This history raises a number of questions. For instance, what do we know
about the mother? It should be said of her that she was very nervous,
and had tried many kinds of sanatoria and systems of cure. She also
had symptoms of fear and nervous asthma. The relations between her and
her husband had been very strained as far back as the patient could
remember. The mother did not understand the father; the daughter always
felt that she understood him better. She was moreover her father's
declared favourite, being inwardly correspondingly cool towards her
mother.

These facts are indications for a survey of the meaning of the illness.
Behind the present symptoms phantasies are operative, connected in
the first place with the young Italian, but further clearly referring
to the father, whose unhappy marriage furnished the little daughter
with an early opportunity of acquiring a position that really should
have been filled by her mother. Behind this conquest there lies, of
course, a phantasy of being the woman who was really suited to her
father. The first attack of neurosis broke out at the moment when
this phantasy received a violent shock, presumably similar to that the
mother had once experienced (a fact that was, however, unknown to the
child). The symptoms are easily comprehensible as the expression of
disappointed and rejected love. The choking is based upon a sensation of
tightening in the throat that is a well-known accompanying phenomenon
of violent effects which we cannot quite "swallow." The metaphors of
language often refer to similar physiological occurrences. When the
father died, it seemed that her consciousness sorrowed deeply but her
unconscious laughed, after the manner of Till Eulenspiegel, who was sad
when he went downhill but was jolly when climbing laboriously, happy
in anticipation of what was coming. When the father was at home the
girl was low-spirited and ill, but whenever he was away she felt much
better. Herein she resembles numerous husbands and wives who as yet are
mutually hiding from each other the secret that they are not under all
circumstances indispensable to one another.

That the unconscious had some right to laugh was shown by the subsequent
period of good health. She succeeded in letting all that had passed
retire behind the trap-door. The experience with the Italian, however,
threatened to bring the netherworld up again. But she quickly pulled the
handle and shut the door. She remained quite well until the dragon of
neurosis came creeping in, just when she imagined herself to be already
safely out of her troubles, in the so-to-say perfected state of wife and
mother. Sexual psychology finds the cause of the neurosis in the fact
that the patient is not at bottom free from the father. This forces her
to resuscitate her former experience at the moment when she discovered
in the Italian the very same disturbing something that had formerly made
such a deep impression upon her when perceived in her father. These
recollections were naturally revived by the analogous experience with
another man, and formed the starting-point of the neurosis. It might
therefore be said that the content and cause of the neurosis lay in the
conflict between the phantastic infantile-erotic relation to the father
on the one hand, and her love for the husband on the other.

But if we now consider the course of the same illness from the
standpoint of the other instinct, that is, of the will to power, a
different complexion is put upon the matter. Her parents' unhappy
marriage afforded an excellent opportunity for the exhibition of
childish instinct for power. The instinct for power desires that, under
all circumstances, the ego should be "on top," whether by straight or
crooked means. At all costs the integrity of the personality must be
preserved.

Every attempt, even what appears to be an attempt of the surroundings,
to bring about the slightest subjection of the individual, is retorted
to by the "masculine protest," as Adler expresses it. The mother's
disappointment and her taking refuge in a neurosis brought about an
opportunity for the development of power and the attainment of a
dominating position. Love and excellence of conduct are, as everybody
knows, extremely well-adapted weapons for the purposes of the instinct
for power. Virtue is not seldom made the means of _forcing_ recognition
from others. Already as a child she knew how to obtain a privileged
position with her father by means of specially pleasing and amiable
behaviour, even occasionally to supplant her mother. This was not out
of love for her father, although love was a good means of obtaining the
coveted superiority. The hysterical laughter at the death of her father
is a striking proof of this fact. One is inclined to consider such an
explanation as a deplorable depreciation of love, if not actually a
malicious insinuation. But let us pause a moment, reflect, and look
at the world as it really is. Have we never seen those innumerable
people who love, and believe in their love, only until its purpose is
achieved, and who then turn away as if they had never loved? And, after
all, does not Nature herself do the same? In fact, is a "purposeless"
love possible? If so, it belongs to the highest human virtues, which
confessedly are extremely rare. Perhaps there is a general disposition
to reflect as little as possible about the nature and purpose of love;
discoveries might be made which would show the value of one's own love
to be less considerable than we had supposed. However, it were dangerous
to life to subtract anything from the value of fundamental instincts,
perhaps specially so to-day, when we seem to have only a minimum of
values left.

So the patient had an attack of hysterical laughter at the death of her
father; she had finally arrived at the top. It was hysterical laughter,
therefore a psychogenic symptom, that is, something proceeding from
unconscious motives and not from those of the conscious ego. That is a
difference that should not be underrated, for it enables us to recognise
whence and how human virtues arise. Their contraries led to hell, that
is, in modern terms, to the unconscious, where the counterparts of our
conscious virtue have long been gathering. That is why our very virtue
makes us desire to know nothing of the unconscious; indeed, it is even
the summit of virtuous wisdom to maintain that there is no unconscious
at all. But unfortunately we are all in a like predicament with Brother
Medardus in E. T. A. Hoffman's "The Elixir of the Devil": somewhere
or other there exists a sinister, terrible brother, our own incarnate
counterpart bound to us by flesh and blood, who comprehends everything,
maliciously hoarding whatever we most desire should disappear beneath
the table.

The first outbreak of neurosis occurred in our patient at the moment
when she became aware of the fact that there was something in her
father which she did not control. And then it dawned upon her of what
use her mother's neurosis was. When one meets with an obstacle that
cannot be overcome by sensible and charming means, there yet exists an
arrangement hitherto unknown to her which her mother had been beforehand
in discovering, and that is neurosis. That is the reason why she now
imitates her mother. But, the astonished reader asks, what is supposed
to be the use of neurosis? What does it effect? Whoever has had a
pronounced case of neurosis in his immediate environment, knows all
that can be "effected" by a neurosis. In fact, there is altogether no
better means of tyrannising over a whole household than by a striking
neurosis. Heart attacks, choking fits, convulsions of all kinds achieve
enormous effects, that can hardly be surpassed. Picture the fountains
of pity let loose, the sublime anxiety of the dear kind parents, the
hurried running to and fro of the servants, the incessant sounding
of the call to the telephone, the hasty arrival of the physicians,
the delicacy of the diagnosis, the detailed examinations, the lengthy
courses of treatment, the considerable expense; and there, in the midst
of all the uproar, lies the innocent sufferer, to whom the household is
even overflowingly grateful, when he has recovered from the "spasms."

The girl discovered this incomparable "arrangement" (to use Adler's
term), applying it on occasion when the father was there with success.
It became unnecessary when the father died, for now she was finally
uppermost. The Italian was soon dismissed, because he laid too much
stress upon her femininity by an inopportune reminder of his manliness.
When the way opened to the possibility of a suitable marriage, she
loved, adapting herself without any complaint to the deplorable rôle of
the queen bee. As long as she held the position of admired superiority,
everything went splendidly. But when her husband evinced a small outside
interest, she was obliged again to have recourse to the extremely
efficacious "arrangement," that is, to the indirect application of
power, because she had once again come upon that thing--this time in
her husband--that had already previously withdrawn her father from her
influence.

That is how the matter appears from the standpoint of the psychology of
power. I fear that the reader will feel as did the Kadi, before whom
the counsel of one party spoke first. When he had ended, the Kadi said:
"Thou hast spoken well. I perceive that thou art right." Then spoke the
counsel for the other party, and when he had ended, the Kadi scratched
himself behind his ear and said: "Thou hast spoken well. I perceive
that thou also art right." There is no doubt that the instinct for
power plays a most extraordinary part. It is true that the complexes of
neurotic symptoms are also exquisite "arrangements," that inexorably
realise their aims with incredible obstinacy and unequalled cunning. The
neurosis is final; that is, it is directed towards an aim. Adler merits
considerable distinction for having demonstrated this.

Which of the two points of view is right? That is a question that might
well cause much brain-racking. For the two explanations cannot be simply
combined, being absolutely contradictory. In one case, it is love and
its course that is the principal and decisive fact; and in the other
case, it is the power of the ego. In the first case the ego is merely
a kind of appendage to the passion for love; and in the second love is
upon occasion merely a means to the end, that of gaining the upper hand.
Whoever has the power of the ego most at heart rebels against the former
conception, whilst he who cares most about love, will never be able to
be reconciled to the latter.
