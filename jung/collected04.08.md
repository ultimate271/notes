## RELATION TO THE HYSTERICAL ATTACK.

So far one point in S. W.'s history has remained unexplained, and
that is her attack. In the second séance she was suddenly seized with
a sort of fainting fit, from which she awoke with a recollection of
various hallucinations. According to her own statement, she had not lost
consciousness for a moment. Judging from the external symptoms and the
course of the attack, one is inclined to regard it as a _narcolepsy_,
or rather a _lethargy_; such, for example, as Loewenfeld has described,
and the more readily as we know that previously one member of her family
(her grandmother) has had an attack of lethargy. It is possible to
imagine that the _lethargic disposition_ (Loewenfeld) had descended to
our subject. In spiritualistic séances it is not usual to see hysterical
convulsions. Our subject showed no sort of convulsive symptoms, but in
their place, perhaps, the peculiar sleeping-states. Ætiologically, at
the outset, two moments must be taken into consideration:

1. The irruption of hypnosis.

2. The psychic stimulation.

1. _Irruption of Partial Hypnosis._--Janet observes that the
subconscious automatisms have a hypnotic influence and can bring about
complete somnambulism.[84]

He made the following experiment: While the patient, who was in the
completely waking state, was engaged in conversation by a second
observer, Janet stationed himself behind her and by means of whispered
suggestions made her unconsciously move her hand and by written signs
give an answer to questions. Suddenly the patient broke off the
conversation, turned round and with her supraliminal consciousness
continued the previously subconscious talk with Janet. She had fallen
into hypnotic somnambulism.[85]

There is here a state of affairs similar to our patient's. But it must
be noted that, for certain reasons discussed later, the sleeping state
is not to be regarded as hypnotic. We therefore come to the question of--

2. _The Psychic Stimulation._--It is told of Bettina Brentano that the
first time she met Goethe she suddenly fell asleep on his knee.[86]

This ecstatic sleep in the midst of extremest torture, the so-called
"witch-sleep," is well known in the history of trials for witchcraft.[87]

With susceptible subjects relatively insignificant stimuli suffice to
bring about the somnambulic state. Thus a sensitive lady had to have
a splinter cut out of her finger. Without any kind of bodily change
she suddenly saw herself sitting by the side of a brook in a beautiful
meadow, plucking flowers. This condition lasted as long as the slight
operation and then disappeared spontaneously.[88]

Loewenfeld[89] has noticed unintentional inducement of hysterical
lethargy through hypnosis.

Our case has certain resemblances to hysterical lethargy[90] as
described by Loewenfeld, viz. the shallow breathing, the diminution of
the pulse, the corpse-like pallor of the face, and further the peculiar
feeling of dying and the thoughts of death.[91]

The retention of one sense is not inconsistent with lethargy: thus in
certain cases of trance the sense of hearing remains.[92]

In Bonamaison's[93] case not only was the sense of touch retained,
but the senses of hearing and smell were quickened. The hallucinatory
content and loud speaking is also met with in persons with
hallucinations in lethargy.[94] Usually there prevails total amnesia
for the lethargic interval. Loewenfeld's[95] case D. had, however,
a fleeting recollection; in Bonamaison's case there was no amnesia.
Lethargic patients do not prove susceptible to the usual waking stimuli,
but Loewenfeld succeeded with his patient St. in turning the lethargy
into hypnosis by means of mesmeric passes, thus combining it with the
rest of consciousness during the attack.[96] Our patient showed herself
absolutely insusceptible in the beginning of the lethargy, but later on
she began to speak spontaneously, was incapable of giving any attention
when her somnambulic ego was speaking, but could attend when it was
one of her automatic personalities. In this last case it is probable
that the hypnotic effect of the automatisms succeeded in achieving a
partial transformation of the lethargy into hypnosis. When we consider
that, according to Loewenfeld's view, the lethargic disposition must not
be "too readily identified with the peculiar condition of the nervous
apparatus in hysteria," then the idea of the family heredity of this
disposition in our case becomes not a little probable. The disease is
much complicated by these attacks.

So far we have seen that the patient's consciousness of her ego is
identical in all the states. We have discussed two secondary complexes
of consciousness and have followed them into the somnambulic attack,
where they appear as the patient's vision when she had lost her motor
activity during the attack. During the next attacks she was impervious
to any external incidents, but on the other hand developed, within
the twilight state, all the more intense activity, in the form of
visions. It seems that many secondary series of ideas must have split
off quite early from the primary unconscious personality, for already,
after the first two séances, "spirits" appeared by the dozen. The
names were inexhaustible in variety, but the differences between the
personalities were soon exhausted and it became apparent that they could
all be subsumed under two types, the _serio-religious_ type and the
_gay-hilarious_. So far it was really only a matter of _two different
unconscious personalities_, which appeared under different names but
had no essential differences. The older type, the grandfather, who
had initiated the automatisms, also first began to make use of the
twilight state. I am not able to remember any suggestion which might
have given rise to the automatic speaking. According to the preceding
view, the attack in such circumstances might be regarded as a partial
auto-hypnosis. The ego-consciousness which remains and, as a result of
its isolation from the external world, occupies itself entirely with
its hallucinations, is what is left over of the waking consciousness.
Thus the automatism has a wide field for its activity. The independence
of the individual central spheres which we have proved at the beginning
to be present in the patient, makes the automatic act of speaking
appear intelligible. Just as the dreamer on occasion speaks in his
sleep, so, too, a man in his waking hours may accompany intensive
thought with an unconscious whisper.[97] The peculiar movements of the
speech-musculature are to be noted. They have also been observed in
other somnambulists.[98]

These clumsy attempts must be directly paralleled with the unintelligent
and clumsy movements of the table or glass, and most probably correspond
to the _preliminary activity_ of the motor portion of the presentation;
that is to say, a stimulus limited to the motor-centre which has not
previously been subordinated to any higher system. Whether the like
occurs in persons who talk in their dreams, I do not know. But it has
been observed in hypnotised persons.[99]

Since the convenient medium of speech was used as the means of
communication, the study of the subconscious personalities was
considerably lightened. Their intellectual compass is a relatively
mediocre one. Their knowledge is greater than that of the waking
patient, including also a few occasional details, such as the birthdays
of dead strangers and the like. The source of these is more or less
obscure, since the patient does not know whence in the ordinary way
she could have procured the knowledge of these facts. These are cases
of so-called cryptomnesia, which are too unimportant to deserve more
extended notice. The intelligence of the two subconscious persons is
very slight; they produce banalities almost exclusively, but their
relation to the conscious ego of the patient when in the somnambulic
state is interesting. They are invariably aware of everything that takes
place during ecstasy and occasionally they render an exact report from
minute to minute.[100]

The subconscious persons only know the patient's phantastic changes of
thought very superficially; they do not understand these and cannot
answer a single question concerning the situation. Their stereotyped
reference to Ivenes is: "Ask Ivenes." This observation reveals a dualism
in the character of the subconscious personalities difficult to explain;
for the grandfather, who gives information by automatic speech, also
appears to Ivenes and, according to her account, teaches her about the
objects in question. How is it that, when the grandfather speaks through
the patient's mouth, he knows nothing of the very things which he
himself teaches her in the ecstasies?

We must again return to the discussion of the first appearance of the
hallucinations. We picture the vision, then, as an irruption of hypnosis
into the visual sphere. That irruption does not lead to a "normal"
hypnosis, but to a "hystero-hypnosis," that is, the simple hypnosis is
complicated by a hysterical attack.

It is not a rare occurrence in the domain of hypnotism for normal
hypnosis to be disturbed, or rather to be replaced by the unexpected
appearance of hysterical somnambulism; the hypnotist in many cases then
loses rapport with the patient. In our case the automatism arising in
the motor area plays the part of hypnotist; the suggestions proceeding
from it (called objective auto-suggestions) hypnotise the neighbouring
areas in which a certain susceptibility has arisen. At the moment
when the hypnotism flows over into the visual sphere, the hysterical
attack occurs which, as remarked, effects a very deep-reaching change
in a large portion of the psychical region. We must now suppose that
the automatism stands in the same relationship to the attack as the
hypnotist to a pathological hypnosis; its influence upon the further
structure of the situation is lost. The hallucinatory appearance of the
hypnotised personality, or rather of the suggested idea, may be regarded
as the last effect upon the somnambulic personality. Thenceforward the
hypnotist becomes only a figure with whom the somnambulic personality
occupies itself independently: he can only state what is going on and is
no longer the _conditio sine qua non_ of the content of the somnambulic
attack. The independent ego-complex of the attack, in our case Ivenes,
has now the upper hand. She groups her own mental products around
the personality of the hypnotiser, that is, of the grandfather, now
degraded to a mere image. In this way we are enabled to understand the
dualism in the character of the grandfather. _The grandfather I. who
speaks directly to those present, is a totally different person and a
mere spectator of his double, grandfather II., who appears as Ivenes'
teacher._ Grandfather I. maintains energetically that both are one and
the same person, and that I. has all the knowledge which II. possesses,
and is only prevented from giving information by the difficulties of
speech. (The dissociation was of course not realized by the patient,
who took both to be one person.) Grandfather I., if closely examined,
however, is not altogether wrong, judging from one fact which seems
to make for the identity of I. and II., viz. that they are never both
present together. When I. speaks automatically, II. is not present;
Ivenes remarks on his absence. Similarly, during the ecstasy, when
she is with II., she cannot say where I. is, or she may learn only on
returning from an imaginary journey that meanwhile I. has been guarding
her body. Conversely I. never says that he is going on a journey with
Ivenes and never explains anything to her. This behaviour should be
noted, for if I. is really separate from II., there seems no reason why
he should not speak automatically at the same time that II. appears,
and be present with II. in the ecstasy. Although this might have been
supposed possible, as a matter of fact it was never observed. How is
this dilemma to be resolved? At all events there exists an identity
of I. and II., but it does not lie in the region of the personality
under discussion; it lies in the basis common to both; that is, in
the personality of the subject which in deepest essence is one and
indivisible. Here we come across the characteristic of all hysterical
dissociations of consciousness. _They are disturbances which only
belong to the superficial, and none reaches so deep as to attack the
strong-knit foundation of the ego-complex._

In many such cases we can find the bridge which, although often
well-concealed, spans the apparently impassable abyss. For instance, by
suggestion, one of four cards is made invisible to a hypnotised person;
he thereupon names the other three. A pencil is placed in his hand with
the instruction to write down all the cards lying there; he correctly
adds the fourth one.[101]

In the aura of his hystero-epileptic attacks a patient of Janet's[102]
invariably had a vision of a conflagration, and whenever he saw an
open fire he had an attack; indeed, the sight of a lighted match was
sufficient to bring about an attack. The patient's visual field on the
left side was limited to 30°, the right eye was shut. The left eye was
fixed in the middle of a perimeter whilst a lighted match was held at
80°. The hystero-epileptic attack took place immediately. Despite the
extensive amnesia in many cases of double consciousness, the patients'
behaviour does not correspond to the degree of their ignorance, but it
seems rather as if a deeper instinct guided their actions in accordance
with their former knowledge. Not only this relatively slight amnesic
dissociation, but the severe amnesia of the epileptic twilight-state,
formerly regarded as _irreparabile damnum_, does not suffice to cut
the inmost threads which bind the ego-complex in the twilight-state to
the normal ego. In one case the content of the twilight-state could be
grafted on to the waking ego-complex.[103]

Making use of these experiments for our case, we obtain the helpful
hypothesis that those layers of the unconscious beyond reach of the
dissociation endeavour to present the unity of automatic personality.
This endeavour is shattered in the deeper-seated and more elemental
disturbance of the hysterical attack,[104] which prevents a more
complete synthesis by the tacking on of associations which are to a
certain extent the most original individual property of supraliminal
personality. _As the Ivenes dream emerged it was fitted on to the
figures accidentally in the field of vision, and henceforth remains
associated with them._
