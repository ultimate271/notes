_From Dr. Loÿ._

    23rd February, 1913.

From your letter of 16th February I want first to single out the
end, where you so admirably assign to its proper place the power of
suggestion in psychoanalysis: "The patient is no empty sack, into which
you can cram what you will; he brings his own predetermined content
with him, with which one has always to reckon afresh." With this I
fully agree, my own experience confirms it. And you add: "This content
remains untouched by involuntary analytical suggestion, but its form is
altered, proteus-fashion, beyond measure." So it becomes a matter of
a sort of "mimicry" by which the patient seeks to escape the analyst,
who is driving him into a corner and therefore for the moment seems
to him an enemy. Until at last, through the joint work of patient and
analyst--the former spontaneously yielding up his psychic content,
the latter only interpreting and explaining--the analysis succeeds in
bringing so much light into the darkness of the patient's psyche that
he can see the true relationships and, without any preconceived plan of
the analyst's, can himself draw the right conclusions and apply them
to his future life. This new life will betake itself along the line of
least resistance--or should we not rather say, the least resistances,
as a "compromise with all the necessities," in a just balancing of
pleasure and unpleasure? It is not we who must arbitrarily seek to
determine how matters stand for the patient and what will benefit him;
his own nature decides. In other words, we must assume the _rôle_ of
the accoucheur who can bring out into the light of day a child already
alive, but who must avoid a series of mistakes if the child is to remain
able to live and the mother is not to be injured. All this is very
clear to me, since it is only the application to the psychoanalytic
method of a general principle which should have universal validity:
never do violence to Nature. Hence I also see that the psychoanalyst
must follow his patient's apparently "wrong roads" if the patient is
ever to arrive at his own convictions and be freed once and for all
from infantile reliance on authority. We ourselves as individuals have
learnt or can only learn by making mistakes how to avoid them for the
future, and mankind as a whole has created the conditions of its present
and future stages of development quite as much by frequent travel along
wrong paths as along the right road. Have not many neurotics--I do not
know if you will agree, but I think so--become ill partly for the very
reason that their infantile faith in authority has fallen to pieces?
Now they stand before the wreckage of their faith, weeping over it, in
dire distress because they cannot find a substitute which shall show
them clearly whither their life's course should now turn. So they remain
stuck fast betwixt infancy which they must unwillingly renounce, and the
serious duties of the present and future (the moral conflict). I see,
particularly in such cases, you are right in saying it is a mistake to
seek to replace the lost faith in authority by another similar faith,
certain to be useful only so long as the belief lasts. This applies to
the deliberate use of suggestion in psychoanalysis, and the building
upon the transference to the doctor as the object of the analytic
therapy. I am no longer in doubt about your maxim: "Every interference
on the analyst's part is a gross mistake in technique. So-called chance
is the law and the order of psychoanalysis." Further, I am entirely
in agreement with you when you say that _altruism necessarily must be
innate in man considered as a herd-animal_. The contrary would be the
thing to be wondered at.

I should be much disposed to agree that not the egoistic, but the
altruistic instincts are primary. Love and trust of the child for the
mother who feeds it, nurses, cherishes and pets it,--love of the man for
his wife, regarded as the going out towards another's personality,--love
for offspring, care for it,--love for kinsfolk, etc. The egoistic
instincts owe their origin to the desire for exclusive possession of
all that surrounds love, the desire to possess the mother exclusively,
in opposition to the father and the brothers and sisters, the desire
to have a woman for himself alone, the desire to possess exclusively
ornaments, clothing, etc. But perhaps you will say I am paradoxical
and that the instincts, egoistic or altruistic, arise together in the
heart of man, and that every instinct is ambivalent in nature. But I
have to ask if the feelings and instincts are really ambivalent? Are
they exactly bipolar? Are the qualities of all emotions altogether
comparable? Is love really the opposite of hate?

However that may be, in any case it is well that man bears the social
law within himself, as an inborn imperative; otherwise our civilised
humanity would fare badly, having to subject themselves to laws imposed
on them from outside only: they would be impervious to the inheritance
of the earlier religious faiths, and would soon fall into complete
anarchy. Man would then have to ask himself whether it would not be
better to maintain by force an extreme belief in religious authority
such as prevailed in the Middle Ages. For the benefits of civilisation,
which strove to grant every individual as much outward freedom as was
consistent with the freedom of others, would be well worth the sacrifice
of free research. But the age of this use of force against nature is
past, civilised man has left this wrong track behind, not arbitrarily,
but obeying an inner necessity, and we may look joyfully towards the
future. Mankind, advancing in knowledge, will find its way across the
ruins of faith in authority to the moral autonomy of the individual.
