_From Dr. Loÿ._

    9th February, 1913.

The selfsame passion for truth possesses us both when we think of pure
research, and the same desire to cure when we are considering therapy.
For the scientist, as for the doctor, we desire the fullest freedom in
all directions, fullest freedom to select and use the methods which
promise the best fulfilment of their ends at any moment. Here we are at
one; but there remains a postulate we must establish to the satisfaction
of others if we want recognition for our views.

First and foremost there is a question that must be answered, an old
question asked already in the Gospels: _What is Truth?_ I think clear
definitions of fundamental ideas are most necessary. How shall we
contrive a working definition of the conception "Truth"? Perhaps an
allegory may help us.

Imagine a gigantic prism extending in front of the sun, so that its
rays are broken up, but suppose man entirely ignorant of this fact. I
exclude the invisible, chemical and ultra-violet rays. Men who live
in a blue-lit region will say: "The sun sends forth blue light only."
They are right and yet they are wrong: from their standpoint they are
capable of perceiving only a _fragment_ of truth. And so too with the
inhabitants of the red, yellow, and in-between regions. And they will
all scourge and slay one another to force _their_ belief in _their_
fragment upon the others--till, grown wiser through travelling in each
others' regions, they come to the harmonious agreement that the sun
sends out light of varying colours. That comprehends more truth, but it
is not yet _the_ Truth. Only when the giant lens shall have recombined
the split-up rays, and when the invisible, chemical and heat rays
have given proof of their own specific effects, will a view more in
accordance with the facts be able to arise, and men will perceive that
the sun emits white light which is split up by the prism into differing
rays with different peculiarities, which rays can be recombined by the
lens into one mass of white light.

This example shows sufficiently well that the road to Truth leads
through far-reaching and comparative observations, the results of which
must be controlled by the help of freely chosen _experiments_, until
well-grounded hypotheses and theories can be put forward; but these
hypotheses and theories will fall to the ground as soon as a single new
observation or experiment contradicts them.

The way is difficult, and in the end all man ever attains to is
_relative_ truth. But such relative truth suffices for the time being,
if it serves to explain the most important actual concatenations of the
past, to light up present problems, to predict those of the future,
so that we are then in a position to achieve adaptation through our
knowledge. But _absolute_ truth could be accessible only to omniscience,
aware of all possible concatenations and combinations; that is not
possible, for the concatenations and their combinations are infinite.
Accordingly, we shall never know more than an approximate truth. Should
new relationships be discovered, new combinations built up, then the
picture changes, and with it the entire possibilities in knowledge and
power. To what revolutions in daily life does not every new scientific
discovery lead: how absurdly little was the beginning of our first
ideas of electricity, how inconceivably great the results! Time and
again it is necessary to repeat this commonplace, because one sees
how life is always made bitter for the innovators in every scientific
field, and now is it being made especially so for the disciples of
the psychoanalytic school. Of course, every one admits the truth of
this platitude so long as it is a matter of "academic" discussion, but
only so long; just as soon as a concrete case has to be considered,
sympathies and antipathies rush into the foreground and darken judgment.
And therefore the scientist must fight tirelessly, appealing to logic
and honour, for freedom of research in every field, and must not
permit authority, of no matter what political or religious tinge, to
advance reasons of _opportunism_ to destroy or restrict this freedom;
opportunist reasons may be and are in place elsewhere, not here. Finally
we must completely disavow that maxim of the Middle Ages: "_Philosophia
ancilla Theologiæ_," and no less, too, the war-cries of the university
class-rooms with their partisanship of one or other religious or
political party. All fanaticism is the enemy of science, which must
above all things be _independent_.

And when we turn from the search for Truth back once more to
therapeutics, we see immediately that here too we are in agreement.
In practice expediency _must_ rule: the doctor from the yellow region
must adapt himself to the sick in the yellow region, as must the
doctor in the blue region, to his patients; both have the same object
in view. And the doctor who lives in the white light of the sun must
take into consideration the past experiences of his patients from the
yellow or blue region, in spite of, or perhaps rather because of, his
own wider knowledge. In such cases the way to healing will be long and
difficult, may indeed lead more easily into a _cul-de-sac_, than in
cases where he has to do with patients who, like himself, have already
come to a knowledge of the white sunlight, or, one might say, when his
patient-material has "already sorted itself out." With such sorted-out
material the psychoanalyst can employ psychoanalysis exclusively; and
may deem himself happy in that he need not "play the augur." Now, what
are these psychoanalytic methods? If I understand you aright, from
beginning to end it is a question of dealing directly and openly with
_the basic forces of the human soul_, so that the analysed person, be
he sick or sound or in some stage between--for health and sickness
flow over by imperceptible degrees into one another--shall gradually
have his eyes opened to the drama that is being acted within him. He
has to come to an understanding of the development of the hostile
automatisms of his personality, and by means of this understanding he
must gradually learn to free himself from them; he must learn, too, how
to employ and strengthen the favourable automatisms. He must learn
to make his self-knowledge real, and of practical use, to control his
soul's workings so that a balance may be established between the spheres
of emotion and reason. And what share in all this has the physician's
_suggestion_? I can scarcely believe that suggestion can be altogether
avoided till the patient feels himself really _free_. Such freedom, it
goes without saying, is the main thing to strive for, and it must be
_active_. The sick man who simply obeys a suggestion, obeys it only just
so long as the "transference to the doctor" remains potent.

But if he wishes to be able to adjust himself to all circumstances he
must have fortified himself "from within." He should no longer need the
crutches of faith, but be capable of encountering all theoretical and
practical problems squarely, and of solving them by himself. That is
surely your view? Or have I not understood correctly?

I next ask, must not every single case be treated differently, of course
_within the limits of the psychoanalytic method_? For if every case is a
case by itself, it must indeed demand individual treatment.

"Il n'y a pas de maladies, il n'y a que des malades," said a French
doctor whose name escapes me. But _on broad lines_, what course, from a
technical point of view, does analysis take, and what deviations occur
most frequently? That I would gladly learn from you. I take for granted
that all "augurs' tricks," darkened rooms, masquerading, chloroform, are
out of the question.

Psychoanalysis--purged so far as is humanly possible from suggestive
influence--appears to have an essential difference from Dubois'
psychotherapy. With Dubois, from the beginning conversation about the
past is forbidden, and "the moral reasons for recovery" placed in the
forefront; whilst psychoanalysis uses the subconscious material from
the patient's past as well as present, for present self-understanding.
Another difference lies in the conception of morality: morals are
above all "_relative_." But what essential forms shall they assume at
those moments when one can hardly avoid suggestion? You will say, the
occasion must decide. Agreed, as regards older people, or adults, who
have to live in an unenlightened _milieu_. But if one is dealing with
children, the seed of the future, is it not a sacred duty to enlighten
them as to the shaky foundations of the so-called "moral" conceptions
of the past, which have only a dogmatic basis; is it not a duty to
educate them into full freedom by courageously unveiling Truth? I ask
this not so much with regard to the analysing doctor as to the teacher.
May not the creation of _free schools_ be looked for as one task for the
psychoanalyst?
