_From Dr. Jung._

    4th February, 1913.

You have put me in some perplexity by the questions in your yesterday's
letter. You have rightly grasped the spirit which dictated my last. I
am glad you, too, recognise this spirit. There are not very many who
can boast of such tolerance. I should deceive myself if I regarded my
standpoint as that of a practical physician. First and foremost I am
a scientist; naturally that gives me a different outlook upon many
problems. In my last letter I certainly left out of count the doctor's
practical needs, but chiefly that I might show you on what grounds we
might be moved to relinquish hypnotic therapy. To remove the first
objection at once, let me say that I did not give up hypnotism because I
desired to avoid dealing with the basic motives of the human soul, but
rather because I wanted to battle with them _directly_ and _openly_.
When once I understood what kind of forces play a part in hypnotism I
gave it up, simply to get rid of all the indirect advantages of this
method. As we psychoanalysts see regretfully every day--and our patients
also--_we do not work with the "transference to the doctor,"_[180] _but
against it and in spite of it_. It is just not upon the _faith_ of the
sick man that we can build, but upon his _criticism_. So much would I
say at the outset upon this delicate question.

As your letter shows, we are at one in regard to the theoretical aspect
of treatment by suggestion. So we can now apply ourselves to the further
task of coming to mutual understanding about the practical question.

Your remarks on the physician's dilemma--whether to be magician or
scientist--bring us to the heart of the discussion. I strive to be no
fanatic--although there are not a few who reproach me with fanaticism. I
contend not for the application of the psychoanalytic method solely and
at all costs, but for the recognition of every method of investigation
and treatment. I was a medical practitioner quite long enough to realise
that practice obeys, and should obey, other laws than does the search
after truth. One might almost say practice must first and foremost
submit to the laws of opportunism. The scientist does great injustice
to the practitioner if he reproaches him for not using the "one true"
scientific method. As I said to you in my last letter: "A truth is a
truth, when it works." But on the other hand, the practitioner must not
reproach the scientist if in his search for truth and for newer and
better methods, he makes trial of unusual ways. After all, it is not the
practitioner but the investigator, and the latter's patient, who will
have to bear any injury that may arise. The practitioner must certainly
use those methods which he knows how to use to greatest advantage, and
which give him the best relative results. My tolerance, indeed, extends,
as you see, even to Christian Science. But I deem it most uncalled for
that Frank, a practising doctor, should depreciate research in which he
cannot participate, and particularly the very line of research to which
he owes his own method. It is surely time to cease this running down of
every new idea. No one asks Frank and all whom he represents to become
psychoanalysts; we grant them the right to their existence, why should
they always seek to cut ours short?

As my own "cures" show you, I do not doubt the effect of suggestion.
Only I had the idea that I could perhaps discover something still
better. This hope has been amply justified. Not for ever shall it be
said--

    "The good attained is oft of fairer still
    The enemy, calling it vain illusion, falsehood's snare."

I confess frankly were I doing your work I should often be in
difficulties if I relied only on psychoanalysis. I can scarcely imagine
a general practice, especially in a sanatorium, with no other means than
psychoanalysis. At Dr. Bircher's sanatorium in ZÃ¼rich the principle of
psychoanalysis is adopted completely by several of the assistants, but
a whole series of other important educative influences are also brought
to bear upon the patients, without which matters would probably go very
badly. In my own purely psychoanalytic practice I have often regretted
that I could not avail myself of the other methods of re-education
that are naturally at hand in an institution--this, of course, only
in special cases where one is dealing with extremely uncontrolled,
uneducated persons. Which of us has shown any disposition to assert that
we have discovered a panacea? There are cases in which psychoanalysis
operates less effectively than any other known method. But who has ever
claimed psychoanalysis should be employed in every sort of case, and on
every occasion? Only a fanatic could maintain such a view. Patients for
whom psychoanalysis is suitable have to be selected. I unhesitatingly
send cases I think unsuitable to other doctors. As a matter of fact
this does not happen often, because patients have a way of sorting
themselves out. Those who go to an analyst usually know quite well why
they go to him and not to some one else. However, there are very many
neurotics well suited for psychoanalysis. In these matters every scheme
must be looked at in due perspective. It is never quite wise to try to
batter down a stone wall with your head. Whether simple hypnotism, the
cathartic treatment, or psychoanalysis shall be used, must be determined
by the conditions of the case and the preference of the _particular_
doctor. Every doctor will obtain the best results with the instrument he
knows best.

But, barring exceptions, _I must say definitely that for me, and
for my patients also, psychoanalysis proves itself better than any
other method_. This is not merely a matter of feeling; from manifold
experiences I know many cases can indeed be cured by psychoanalysis
which are refractory to all other methods of treatment. I have many
colleagues whose experience is the same, even men engaged exclusively
in practice. It is scarcely to be supposed that a method altogether
contemptible would meet with so much support.

When once psychoanalysis has been applied in a suitable case, it is
_imperative_ that rational solutions of the conflicts should be found.
The objection is at once advanced that many conflicts are intrinsically
incapable of solution. That view is sometimes taken because only an
external solution is thought of--and that, at bottom, is no real
solution at all. If a man cannot get on with his wife he naturally
thinks the conflict would be solved if he were to marry some one
else. If such marriages are examined they are seen to be no solution
whatsoever. The old Adam enters upon the new marriage and bungles it
just as badly as he did the earlier one. _A real solution comes only
from within, and only then because the patient has been brought to a new
standpoint._

Where an external solution is possible no psychoanalysis is necessary;
in seeking an internal solution we encounter the peculiar virtues of
psychoanalysis. The conflict between "love and duty" must be solved
upon that particular plane of character where "love and duty" are no
longer in opposition, for indeed they really are not so. The familiar
conflict between "instinct and conventional morality" must be solved
in such a way that both factors are taken satisfactorily into account,
and this is only possible through a change of character. This change
psychoanalysis can bring about. In such cases external solutions are
worse than none at all. Naturally the particular situation dictates
which road the doctor must ultimately follow, and what is then his duty.
I regard the conscience-searching question of the doctor's remaining
true to his scientific convictions as rather unimportant in comparison
with the incomparably weightier question as to how he can best help his
patient. The doctor _must_, on occasion, be able to play the augur.
_Mundus vult decipi_--but the cure is no deception. It is true that
there is a conflict between ideal conviction and concrete possibility.
_But we should ill prepare the ground for the seed of the future, were
we to forget the tasks of the present, and sought only to cultivate
ideals._ That is but idle dreaming. Do not forget that Kepler cast
horoscopes for money, and that countless artists have been condemned to
work for wages.
