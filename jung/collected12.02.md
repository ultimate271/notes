_From Dr. Jung._

    28th January, 1913.

With regard to your question as to the applicability of the cathartic
method, the following is my standpoint: every method is good if
it serves its purpose, including every method of suggestion, even
Christian Science, Mental Healing, etc. "_A truth is a truth, when it
works._" It is quite another question whether a scientific physician
can answer for it to his conscience should he sell little bottles of
Lourdes-water because that suggestion is at times very useful. Even
the so-called highly scientific suggestion-therapy employs the wares
of the medicine-man and the exorcising Schaman. And please, why should
it not? The public is not even now much more advanced and continues
to expect miracles from the doctor. And truly those doctors should be
deemed clever--worldly-wise in every respect--who understand the art
of investing themselves with the halo of the medicine-man. Not only
have they the biggest practices--they have also the best results. This
is simply because countless physical maladies (leaving out of count
the neuroses) are complicated and burdened with psychic elements to an
extent scarcely yet suspected. The medical exorcist's whole behaviour
betrays his full valuation of the psychic element when he gives the
patient the opportunity of fixing his faith firmly upon the doctor's
mysterious personality. Thus does he win the sick man's mind, which
henceforth helps him indeed to restore his body also to health. The cure
works best when the doctor really believes in his own formul√¶, otherwise
he may be overcome by scientific doubt and so lose the correct,
convincing tone. I, too, for a time practised hypnotic suggestion
enthusiastically. But there befell me three dubious incidents which I
want you to note:--

1. Once there came to me to be hypnotised for various neurotic troubles
a withered peasant-woman of some fifty years old. She was not easy to
hypnotise, was very restless, kept opening her eyes--but at last I did
succeed. When I waked her after about half an hour she seized my hand
and with many words testified to her overflowing gratitude. I said:
"But you are by no means cured yet, so keep your thanks till the end of
the treatment." She: "I am not thanking you for that, but--(blushing
and whispering)--because you have been so _decent_." So she said,
looked at me with a sort of tender admiration and departed. I gazed
long at the spot where she had stood--and asked myself, confounded,
"So decent?"--good heavens! surely she hadn't imagined, somehow or
other.... This glimpse made me suspect for the first time that possibly
the loose-minded person, by means of that notorious feminine (I should
at that time have said "animal") directness of instinct, understood
more about the essence of hypnotism than I with all my knowledge of the
scientific profundity of the text-books. Therein lay my harmlessness.

2. Next came a pretty, coquettish, seventeen-year-old girl with a
harassed, suspicious mother. The young daughter had suffered since early
girlhood from _enuresis nocturna_, which, among other difficulties,
hindered her from going to a boarding-school abroad.

At once I thought of the old woman and her wisdom. I tried to hypnotise
the girl; she laughed affectedly and prevented hypnosis for twenty
minutes. Of course I kept quiet and thought: I know why you laugh; you
have already fallen in love with me, but I will give you proof of my
decency in gratitude for your wasting my time with your challenging
laughter. I succeeded in hypnotising her. Success followed at once. The
enuresis stopped, and I therefore informed the young lady later that,
instead of Wednesday, I would not see her again for hypnosis till the
following Saturday. On Saturday she arrived with a cross countenance,
presaging failure. The enuresis had come back again. I remembered
my wise old woman, and asked: "When did the enuresis return?" She
(unsuspecting), "Wednesday night." I thought to myself, There it is
again, she wants to show me that I simply must see her on Wednesdays
too; not to see me for a whole long week is too much for a tender,
loving heart. But I was quite resolved to give no help to such annoying
romancing, so I said, "To continue the hypnosis would be quite wrong
under these circumstances. We must drop it for quite three weeks, to
give the enuresis a chance to stop. Then come again for treatment." In
my malicious heart I knew I should then be on my holiday and so the
course of hypnotic treatment would come to an end. After the holidays my
_locum tenens_ told me the young lady had been there with the news that
the enuresis had vanished, but her disappointment at not seeing me was
very keen. The old woman was right, thought I.

3. The third case gave my joy in suggestion its death-blow. This was
the manner of it. She was a lady of sixty-five who came stumbling into
the consulting-room with a crutch. She had suffered from pain in the
knee-joint for seventeen years, and this at times kept her in bed for
many weeks. No doctor had been able to cure her, and she had tried
every possible remedy of present-day medicine. After I had suffered the
stream of her narrative to flow over me for some ten minutes, I said,
"I will try to hypnotise you, perhaps that will do you good." She, "Oh
yes, please do!" leaned her head on one side and fell asleep before
ever I said or did anything. She passed into somnambulism and showed
every form of hypnosis you could possibly desire. After half an hour I
had the greatest difficulty in waking her; when at last she was awake
she jumped up: "I am well, I am all right, you have cured me." I tried
to make timid objections, but her praises drowned me. She could really
walk. Then I blushed and said, embarrassed, to my colleagues: "Look!
behold the wondrously successful hypnotic therapy." That day saw the
death of my connection with treatment by suggestion; the therapeutic
praise won by this case shamed and humiliated me. When, a year later, at
the beginning of my hypnotic course, the good old lady returned, this
time with the pain in her back, I was already sunk in hopeless cynicism;
I saw written on her forehead that she had just read the notice of the
re-opening of my clinic in the newspaper, that vexatious romanticism
had provided her with a convenient pain in the back so that she might
have a pretext for seeing me, and again let herself be cured in the same
theatrical fashion. This proved true in every particular.

As you will understand, a man possessed of scientific conscience cannot
endure such cases without embarrassment. There ripened in me the resolve
to renounce suggestion altogether rather than to allow myself passively
to be transformed into a miracle-worker. I wanted to understand what
really went on in the souls of people. It suddenly seemed to me
incredibly childish to think of dispelling an illness with charms, and
that this should be the only result of our scientific endeavours for
a psychotherapy. Thus for me the discovery of Breuer and Freud was a
veritable deliverance. I took up their method with unalloyed enthusiasm
and soon recognised how right Freud was, when at a very early date,
indeed so far back as the _Studien ueber Hysterie_, he began to direct a
searchlight upon the accompanying circumstances of the so-called trauma.
I too soon discovered that certainly some traumata with an obvious
etiological tinge are opportunely present. But the greater number
appeared highly improbable. So many of them seemed so insignificant,
even so normal, that at most one could regard them as just providing
the opportunity for the neurosis to appear. But what especially
spurred my criticism was the fact that so many traumata were simply
inventions of phantasy which had never really existed. This perception
was enough to make me sceptical about the whole trauma-theory. (But I
have dealt with these matters in detail in my lectures on the theory
of psychoanalysis).[177] I could no longer suppose that the hundred
and one cathartic experiences of a phantastically puffed-up or entirely
invented trauma were anything but the effect of suggestion. It is well
enough if it helps. If one only had not a scientific conscience and that
impulsion towards the truth! I found in many cases, especially when
dealing with more mentally gifted patients, that I must recognise the
therapeutic limitations of this method. It is, of course, a definite
plan, and convenient for the doctor, since it makes no particular
demands upon his intellect for new adaptations. The theory and practice
are both of the pleasantest simplicity: "The neurosis is caused by
a trauma. The trauma is abreacted." When the abreaction takes place
under hypnotism, or with other magical accessories (dark room, peculiar
lighting, and the rest), I remember once more the wise old woman,
who opened my eyes not merely to the magic influence of the mesmeric
gestures, but also to the essential character of hypnotism itself. But
what alienated me once for all from this relatively efficacious indirect
method of suggestion, based as it is upon an equally efficacious false
theory, was the perception I obtained at the same time that, behind the
confused deceptive intricacies of neurotic phantasies, there stands a
_conflict_, which may be best described as a _moral_ one. With this
there began for me a new era of understanding. Research and therapy
now coincided in the attempt to discover the causes and the _rational_
solution of this conflict. That is what psychoanalysis meant to me.
Whilst I had been getting this insight, Freud had built up his sexual
theory of the neurosis, and therewith had brought forward an enormous
number of questions for discussion, all of which I thought deserved
the profoundest consideration. Thus I have had the good fortune of
co-operating with Freud for a long time, and working with him in the
investigation of the problem of sexuality in neurosis. You, perhaps,
know from some of my earlier work that I was always dubious somewhat
concerning the significance of sexuality.[178] This has now become the
exact point where I am no longer altogether of Freud's opinion.

I have preferred to answer your questions in rather non-sequent fashion.
Whatever is still unanswered, let me now repeat: _light hypnosis_ and
_complete hypnosis_ are but varying grades of intensity of unconscious
attraction towards the hypnotist. Who can here venture to draw sharp
distinctions? To a critical intelligence it is unthinkable that
suggestibility and suggestion can be excluded in the cathartic method.
They are present everywhere and are universal human attributes, even
with Dubois and the psychoanalysts who think they work on purely
rational lines. _No technique, no self-deception avails here--the
doctor works, nolens volens--and perhaps primarily--by means of his
personality, that is by suggestion._ In the cathartic treatment, what
is of far more importance to the patient than the conjuring up of old
phantasies is the being so often with the doctor, and having confidence
and belief in him personally, and in his method. The belief, the
self-confidence, perhaps also the devotion with which the doctor does
his work, are far more important things to the patient (_imponderabilia_
though they be) than the recalling of old traumata.[179]

Ultimately we shall some day know from the history of medicine
everything that has ever been of service; then perhaps at last we may
come to the really desirable therapy, to psychotherapy. Did not even
the old materia medica of filth have brilliant cures?--cures which only
faded away with the belief in it!

Because I recognise that the patient does attempt to lay hold of the
doctor's personality, in spite of all possible rational safeguards,
I have formulated the demand that the psychotherapeutist shall be
held just as responsible for the cleanness of his own hands as is the
surgeon. I hold it to be an absolutely indispensable preliminary that
the psychoanalyst should himself first undergo an analysis, for his
personality is one of the chief factors in the cure.

Patients read the doctor's character intuitively and they should find in
him a human being, with faults indeed, but also a man _who has striven
at every point_ to _fulfil his own human duties in the fullest sense_. I
think that this is the first healing factor. Many times I have had the
opportunity of seeing that the analyst is successful with his treatment
just in so far as he has succeeded in his own moral development. I think
this answer will satisfy your question.
