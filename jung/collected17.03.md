## II.--THE SEXUAL THEORY.

Thus, it will be seen, the theory had to be shifted on to an entirely
different basis, for the investigation now had to face the erotic
conflict itself. Our example shows that this contains extremely abnormal
elements and cannot, _primâ facie_, be compared with an ordinary love
conflict. It is surprising, indeed hardly credible, that only the
postulated affection should be conscious, whilst the real passion
remained unknown to the patient. But in this case it is beyond dispute
that the real erotic relation remained unillumined, whilst the field of
consciousness was dominated by the assumption. If we try to formulate
this fact, something like the following proposition results: _in a
neurosis_, two erotic tendencies exist which stand in extreme opposition
to one another, and one at least is unconscious. Against this formula
the objection can be raised that it has obviously been derived from
this one particular case, and is therefore lacking in general validity.
The criticism will be the more readily urged because no one unpossessed
of special reasons is willing to admit that the erotic conflict is of
universal prevalence. On the contrary, it is assumed that this conflict
belongs more properly to the sphere of novels, since it is generally
depicted as something in the nature of such wild adventures as are
described by Karin Michaelis in her "Aberrations of Marriage," or by
Forel in "The Sexual Question." But indeed this is not the case; for we
know the wildest and most moving dramas are not played on the stage, but
every day in the hearts of ordinary men and women who pass by without
exciting attention, and who betray to the world, save through the symbol
of a nervous breakdown, nothing of the conflicts that rage within them.
But what is so difficult for the layman to grasp is the fact that in
most cases patients have no suspicion whatever of the internecine
war raging in their unconscious. But remembering that there are many
people who understand nothing at all about themselves, we shall be less
surprised at the realisation that there are also people who are utterly
unaware of their actual conflicts.

If the reader is now inclined to admit the possible existence of
pathogenic, and perhaps even of unconscious conflicts, he will certainly
protest that they are not erotic conflicts. If this kind reader should
happen himself to be somewhat nervous, the mere suggestion will arouse
his indignation, for we are all inclined, as a result of our education
in school and at home, to cross ourselves three times where we meet such
words as "erotic" and "sexual"--and so we are conveniently able to think
that nothing of that nature exists, or at least very seldom, and at a
great distance from ourselves. But it is just this attitude which in the
first instance brings about neurotic conflicts.

We recognise that the course of civilisation consists in the progressive
mastering of the animal element in man; it is a process of domestication
which cannot be carried through without rebellion on the part of the
animal nature still thirsting for its liberty. Humanity forces itself
to endure the restrictions of the civilising process; but from time
to time there comes a frenzied bursting of all bonds. Antiquity had
experience of it in that wave of Dionysian orgies, surging hither from
the East, which became an essentially characteristic element of antique
culture. Its spirit was partly instrumental in causing the numerous
sects and philosophic schools of the last century before Christ, to
develop the Stoic ideal into asceticism; and in producing from the
polytheistic chaos of those times, the ascetic twin-religions of Mithras
and of Christ. A second clearly marked wave of the Dionysian impulse
towards freedom swept over the Western world during the Renaissance.
It is difficult to judge of one's own time, but we gain some insight
if we note how the Arts are developing, what is the prevailing type of
public taste, what men read and write, what societies they found, what
"questions" are the order of the day, and against what the Philistines
are fighting. We find in the long list of our present social problems
that the sexual question occupies by no means the last place. It
agitates men and women who would shake the foundations of sexual
morality, and throw off the burden of moral shame which past centuries
have heaped upon Eros. The existence of these aspirations and endeavours
cannot be simply denied, or declared indefensible; they exist and
are therefore presumably not without justification. It is both more
interesting and more useful to study carefully the basic causes of these
movements than to chime in with the lamentations of the professional
mourners over morals, who prophesy with unction the moral downfall of
humanity. The moralist least of all trusts God, for he thinks that the
beautiful tree of humanity can only thrive by dint of being pruned,
bound, and trained on a trellis, whereas Father-Sun and Mother-Earth
have combined to make it grow joyfully in accordance with its own laws,
which are full of the deepest meaning.

Serious people are aware that a very real sexual problem does exist
at the present time. The rapid development of the towns, coupled with
methods of work brought about by the extraordinary division of labour,
the increasing industrialisation of the country and the growing security
of life, combine to deprive humanity of many opportunities of expending
emotional energy. Think of the life of the peasant, whose work so rich
and full of change, affords him unconscious satisfaction by means of its
symbolic content; a like satisfaction the factory-hand and the clerk
can never know. Think of a life with nature; of those wonderful moments
when, as lord and fructifier, man drives the plough through the earth,
and with kingly gesture scatters the seed of the future harvest; see his
justifiable awe before the destructive power of the elements, his joy in
the fruitfulness of his wife, who gives him daughters and sons, who mean
to him increased working power and enhanced prosperity. Alas! from all
this we town-dwellers, we modern machines, are far, far removed.

Must we not admit that we are already deprived of the most natural and
most beautiful of all satisfactions, since we can no longer contemplate
the arrival of our own seed, the "blessing" of children, with unmixed
pleasure? Marriages where no artifices are resorted to are rare.
Is this not an all-important departure from the joys which Mother
Nature gave her first-born sons? Can such a state of affairs bring
satisfaction? Note how men slink to their work, watch their faces at
an early morning hour in the tram-cars. One of them makes his little
wheels, and another writes trivial things which do not interest him.
What wonder is it if such men belong to as many clubs as there are days
in the week, and that among women little societies flourish, where they
pour out on some particular hero or cause those unsatisfied desires
which the man dulls at his restaurant or club, imbibing beer and playing
at being important? To these sources of dissatisfaction is added a more
serious factor. Nature has provided defenceless, weaponless man with a
great amount of energy to enable him not merely to bear passively the
grave dangers of existence, but also to conquer them. Mother Nature
has equipped her son for tremendous hardships and has placed a costly
premium on the overcoming of them, as Schopenhauer quite understood when
he said that "happiness is really but the termination of unhappiness."
Civilized people are, as a rule, shielded from the immediately pressing
dangers, and they are therefore daily tempted to excess, for in man
the animal always becomes rampant when he is not constrained by fierce
necessity. Are we then indeed unrestrained? In what orgiastic festivals
do _we_ dispose of the surplus of vital power? Our moral views do not
permit us that outlet.

But reckon up in how many directions we are met by unsatisfied
longings; the denial of procreation and begetting, for which purpose
nature has endowed us with great energy; the unending monotony of
our highly developed modern methods of "division of labour," which
excludes any interest in the work itself; and above all our effortless
security against war, lawlessness, robbery, epidemics, infant and
woman mortality--all this gives a sum of surplus energy which must
needs find an outlet. But how? A relatively few create quasi-natural
dangers for themselves in reckless sport; many more, seeking to find
some equivalent for their more primitive energy, take to alcoholic
excess; others expend themselves in the rush of money-making, or in the
morbid performance of duties, in perpetual over-work. By such means
they try to escape a dangerous storing-up of energy which might force
mad outlets for itself. It is for such reasons that we have to-day a
_sexual question_. It is in this direction that men's energy would like
to expend itself as it has done from time immemorial in periods of
security and abundance. Under such circumstances it is not only rabbits
that multiply; men and women, too, become the sport of these accesses
of nature: the sport, because their moral views have confined them in a
narrow cage, the excessive narrowness of which was not felt so long as
harsh external necessity pressed upon them with even greater constraint.
But now the man of the cities finds the space too circumscribed. He is
surrounded by alluring temptation, and like an invisible _procureur_
there slinks through society the knowledge of preventive methods which
evade all consequences. Why then moral restraint? Out of religious
consideration for an angry God? Apart from the prevalence of widespread
unbelief, even the believing man might quietly ask himself whether, if
he himself were God, he would punish the youthful erotic uncontrol of
John and Mary with twice twenty-four years of imprisonment and seething
in boiling oil. Such ideas are no longer compatible with our decorous
conception of God. The God of our time is necessarily much too tolerant
to make a great fuss over it; (knavishness and hypocrisy are a thousand
times worse). In this way the somewhat ascetic and hypocritical sexual
morality of our time has had the ground cut from under its feet.
Or is it the case that we are now protected from dissoluteness by
superior wisdom, recognition of the nothingness of human happenings?
Unfortunately we are very far from that; rather does the hypnotic power
of tradition keep us in bonds, and through cowardice and thoughtlessness
and habit the herd goes tramping on in this same path. But man possesses
in the unconscious a fine scent for the spirit of his time; he has an
inkling of his own possibilities and he feels in his innermost heart
the instability of the foundations of present-day morality, no longer
supported by living religious conviction. It is thus the greater number
of the erotic conflicts of our time originate. Instinct thirsting for
liberty thrusts itself up against the yielding barriers of morality: men
are tempted, they desire and do not desire. And because they will not
and cannot think out to its logical conclusion what it is they really
desire, their erotic conflict is largely unconscious; whence comes
neurosis. Neurosis then is most intimately bound up with the problem of
our times and represents an unsuccessful attempt of the individual to
solve the general problem in his own person. Neurosis is a tearing in
two of the _inner self_. For most men the reason of this cleavage is
the fact that their conscious self desires to hold to its moral ideal,
whilst the unconscious strives after the amoral ideal, steadfastly
rejected by the conscious self. People of this kind would like to appear
more decent than they really are. But the conflict is often of an
opposite kind. There are those who do not outwardly live a decent life
at all and do not place the slightest constraint upon their sexuality,
but in reality this is a sinful pose assumed for goodness knows what
reasons, for down below they have a decorous soul which has somehow gone
astray in their unconscious, just as has the real immoral nature in
the case of apparently moral people. Extremes of conduct always arouse
suspicions of the opposite tendencies in the unconscious.

It was necessary to make this general statement in order to elucidate
the idea of the "erotic conflict" in analytical psychology, for it is
the key to the conception of neurosis. We can now proceed to consider
the psychoanalytic technique. Obviously the main problem is, how to
arrive by the shortest and best path at a knowledge of the patient's
"unconscious." The method first used was hypnotism, the patient being
questioned, on the production of spontaneous phantasies observed while
in a state of hypnotic concentration. This method is still occasionally
used, but in comparison with the present technique is primitive and
frequently unsatisfactory. A second method, evolved by the Psychiatric
Clinic, Zürich, was the so-called association method,[227] which is
chiefly of theoretic, experimental value. Its result is an extensive,
though superficial orientation, concerning the unconscious conflict
("complex").[228] The more penetrating method is that of dream-analysis
whose discovery belongs to Sigmund Freud.[229]

Of the dream it can be said that "the stone which the builders rejected
has become the head of the corner." It is only in modern times that
the dream (that fleeting and seemingly insignificant product of the
soul), has met with such complete contempt. Formerly it was esteemed,
as a harbinger of fate, a warning or a consolation, a messenger of the
gods. Now we use it as a messenger of the unconscious; it must disclose
to us the secrets which our unconscious self enviously hides from our
consciousness, and it does so with astonishing completeness.

On analytical investigation it becomes plain that the dream, as we
remember it, is only a façade which conceals the contents within the
house. But if, observing certain technical rules, we get the dreamer
to talk about the details of his dream, it soon appears that his free
associations group themselves in certain directions and round certain
topics. These appear to be of personal significance, and have a meaning
which at first sight would not be suspected. Careful comparison
shows that they are in close and subtle symbolic connection with the
dream-façade.[230] This particular complex of ideas in which all the
threads of the dream unite, is the conflict for which we are seeking;
is its particular form at the moment, conditioned by the immediate
circumstances. What is painful and incompatible is in this way so
covered up or split that we can call it a wish-fulfilment; but we must
immediately add that the wishes fulfilled in the dream do not seem
at first sight to be _our_ wishes, but rather the very opposite. For
instance, a daughter loves her mother tenderly, but she dreams that
her mother is dead; this causes her great grief. Such dreams, where
apparently there is no trace of any wish-fulfilment are innumerable, and
are a constant stumbling-block to our learned critics, for--_incredible
dictu_--they still cannot grasp the simple distinction between the
_manifest_ and the _latent_ content of the dream. We must guard against
such an error; the conflict dealt with in the dream is an unconscious
one, and equally so also is the manner its solution. Our dreamer has,
as a matter of fact, the wish to get away from her mother--expressed
in the language of the unconscious, she wants her mother to die. Now
we know that a certain section of the unconscious contains all our
lost memories, and also all those infantile impulses that cannot find
any application in adult life--a series, that is, of ruthless childish
desires. We may say that for the most part the unconscious bears an
infantile stamp; like the child's simple wish: "Daddy, when Mummie is
dead, will you marry me?" In a dream that infantile expression of a
wish is the substitute for a recent wish to marry, which is painful to
the dreamer for reasons still undiscovered. This thought, or rather the
seriousness of its corresponding intention, is said to be "repressed
into the unconscious" and must there necessarily express itself in
an infantile way, for the material which is at the disposal of the
unconscious consists chiefly of infantile memories. As the latest
researches of the Zürich school have shown,[231] these are not only
infantile memories but also "racial" memories, extending far beyond the
limits of individual existence.

Important desires which have not been sufficiently gratified, or have
been "repressed," during the day find their symbolic substitution
in dreams. Because moral tendencies usually predominate in waking
hours, these ungratified desires which strive to realise themselves
symbolically in the dream are, as rule, erotic ones. It is, therefore,
somewhat rash to tell dreams before one who understands, for the
symbolism is often extremely transparent to him who knows the rules! The
clearest in this respect are "anxiety-dreams" which are so common, and
which invariably symbolise a strong erotic desire.

Often the dream apparently deals with quite irrelevant details, thereby
making a ridiculous impression; or else it is so unintelligible that we
are simply amazed at it, and accordingly have to overcome considerable
resistance in ourselves before we can set to work seriously to unravel
its symbolic weaving by patient work. But when at last we penetrate
into its real meaning we find ourselves at a bound in the very heart of
the dreamer's secrets, and find to our astonishment that an apparently
senseless dream is quite full of sense, and deals with extraordinarily
important and serious problems of the soul. Having acquired this
knowledge we cannot refrain from giving rather more credit to the
old superstitions concerning the meaning of dreams for which our
rationalising tendencies, until lately, had no use.

As Freud says: "Dream-analysis is the _via regia_ to the unconscious."
Dream-analysis leads us into the deepest personal secrets, and it is
therefore an invaluable instrument in the hand of the psychotherapist
and educator. The objections of the opponents of this method are based,
as might be expected, upon argument, which (setting aside undercurrents
of personal feeling) show the bias of present-day Scholasticism. It
so happens that it is just the analysis of dreams which mercilessly
uncovers the deceptive morals and hypocritical affectations of man, and
shows him the under side of his character; can we wonder if many feel
that their toes have been rather painfully trodden upon? In connection
with the dream-analysis I am always reminded of the striking statue of
Carnal Pleasure in Bâle Cathedral, which shows in front the sweet smile
of archaic sculpture, but behind is covered with toads and serpents.
Dream-analysis reverses the figure and for once shows the other side.
The ethical value of this reality-correction (Wirklichkeitscorrectur)
cannot be disputed. It is a painful but extremely useful operation,
which makes great demands on both physician and patient.

Psychoanalysis, in so far as we are considering it as a therapeutic
technique, consists mainly of the analysis of many dreams; the dreams
in the course of the treatment bringing up successively the contents of
the unconscious in order that they may be subjected to the disinfecting
power of daylight, and in this process many a valuable thing believed
to have been lost is found again. It is not surprising that for
those persons who have adopted a certain pose towards themselves,
psychoanalysis is at times a real torture, since in accordance with
the old mystic saying, "Give all thou hast, then only shalt thou
receive," there is first the necessity to get rid of almost all the
dearly cherished illusions, to permit the advent of something deeper,
finer, and greater, for only through the mystery of self-sacrifice is
it possible to be "born-again." It is indeed ancient wisdom which again
sees the daylight in psychoanalytic treatment, and it is a curious
thing that this kind of psychic re-education proves to be necessary at
the height of our modern culture; this education which in more than
one respect can be compared to the technique of Socrates, even though
psychoanalysis penetrates to much greater depths.

We always find in a patient some conflict, which at a particular
point, is connected with the great problems of society; so that when
the analysis has arrived at this point the apparently individual
conflict is revealed as a universal conflict of the environment and the
epoch. Neurosis is thus, strictly speaking, nothing but an individual
attempt, however unsuccessful, at a solution of the general problem;
it must be so, for a general problem, a "question," is not an end in
itself; it only exists in the hearts and heads of individual men and
women. The "question" which troubles the patient is--whether you like
it or not--the "sexual" question, or more precisely, the problem of
present-day _sexual morality_. His increased demands upon life and the
joy of life, upon glowing reality, can stand the necessary limitations
which _reality_ sets, but not the arbitrary, ill-supported prohibitions
of present-day morals, which would curb too much the creative spirit
rising up from the depths of the darkness of the beasts that perish.
For the _neurotic has in him the soul of a child_ that can but
ill-endure arbitrary limitations of which it does not see the meaning;
it tries to adopt the moral standard, but thereby only falls into
deeper disunion and distress within itself. On the one hand it tries to
suppress itself, and on the other to free itself--this is the struggle
that is called Neurosis. If this conflict were altogether clear to
consciousness it would of course never give rise to neurotic symptoms;
these only arise when we cannot see the other side of our character, and
the urgency of the problems of that other side. In these circumstances
symptoms arise which partially express what is unrecognised in the
soul. The symptom is, therefore, an indirect expression of unrecognised
desires, which, were they conscious, would be in violent opposition to
the sufferer's moral views. As we have already said, this dark side
of the soul does not come within the purview of consciousness, and
therefore the patient cannot deal with it, correct it, resign himself to
it, or renounce it, for he cannot be said to _possess_ the unconscious
impulses. By being repressed from the hierarchy of the conscious soul,
they have become _autonomous complexes_ which can be brought again
under control by analysis of the unconscious, though not without great
resistance. There are a great many patients whose great boast it is that
the erotic conflict does not exist for them; they are sure that the
sexual question is nonsense, that they have, so to say, no sexuality.
These people do not see that other things of unknown origin cumber their
path, such as hysterical whims, underhand tricks, from which they make
themselves, or those nearest them, suffer; nervous stomach-catarrh, pain
here and there, irritability without reason, and a whole host of nervous
symptoms. All which things show what is wrong with them, for relatively,
only a few specially favoured by fate, avoid the great conflict.

Analytical psychology has already been reproached with setting at
liberty the animal instincts of men, hitherto happily repressed, and
causing thereby untold harm. This childish apprehension clearly proves
how little trust is put in the efficacy of present-day moral principles.
It is pretended that only morals can restrain men from dissoluteness;
a much more efficient regulator, however, is _necessity_, which sets
much more real and convincing bounds than any moral principles. It is
true that analysis liberates animal instincts, but not, as some have
said, just in order to let them loose, but rather to make them available
for higher application, in so far as this is possible to the particular
individual, and in so far as such "sublimated" application is required.
Under all circumstances it is an advantage to be in full possession of
one's own personality, for otherwise the repressed desires will get in
the way in a most serious manner, and overthrow us just in that place
where we are most vulnerable. It is surely better that a man learn to
tolerate himself, and instead of making war on himself convert his inner
difficulties into real experiences, rather than uselessly repeat them
again and again in phantasy. Then at least he lives, and does not merely
consume himself in fruitless struggles. But when men are educated to
recognise the baser side of their own natures, it may be hoped they will
learn to understand and love their fellow-men better too. A decrease of
hypocrisy and an increase of tolerance towards oneself, can have only
good results in tolerance towards one's neighbours, for men are only too
easily disposed to extend to others the unfairness and violence which
they do to their own natures.

Freud's theory of repression does, indeed, seem to postulate the
existence only of people who, being too moral, are continually
repressing the immorality of their natural instincts. According to this
idea, the immoral man who allows his natural instincts an unbridled
existence should be proof against neurosis. But daily experience proves
this is obviously not the case; he may be just as neurotic as other men.
If we analyse him, we find that it is simply his decency that has been
repressed. Therefore, when an immoral man is neurotic, he represents
what Nietzsche appropriately described as "the pale criminal," a man who
does not stand upon the same level as his deed.[232]

The opinion may be held, that in such a case the repressed remnants
of decency are merely infantile traditional legacies, that impose
unnecessary fetters upon natural instincts, for which reason they should
be eradicated. The principle "écraser l'infâme" would be the natural
culmination of such an absolute let-instinct-live theory.[233] That
would obviously be quite phantastic and nonsensical. It should, indeed,
never be forgotten--and the Freudian School needs this reminder--that
morality was not brought down upon tables of stone from Sinai and forced
upon the people, but that morality is a function of the human soul,
which is as old as humanity itself. Morality is not inculcated from
without. Man has it primarily within himself--not the law indeed, but
the essence of morals.

After all, does a more moral view-point exist than the let-instinct-live
theory? Is there a more heroic morality than this? That is why
Nietzsche, the heroic, is especially partial to it. It is natural and
inborn cowardice that makes people say, "God preserve me from following
my instincts," thinking that they thus prove their high moral standard.
They do not understand that following one's bent is really much too
costly for them, too strenuous, too dangerous, and finally it cuts
somewhat against that sense of decency which most people associate
rather with taste than with a categorical imperative. The unpardonable
fault of the let-instinct-live theory is, that it is much too heroic,
too idealogic for the multitude.

There is, therefore, probably no other way for the immoral man but
to accept the moral corrective of his unconscious, just as he who
is moral must come to terms as best he may, with his demons of the
netherworld. It cannot be gainsaid that the Freudian School is so
convinced of the fundamental, and even exclusive importance of
sexuality in neurosis, that it has been courageous enough to face the
consequences of its convictions by heroically attacking the sexual
morality of the present day. Many different opinions prevail upon
this subject. What is significant is, that the problem of sexual
morality is being widely discussed at the present time. This is
doubtless both useful and necessary, for hitherto we have not really
had any sexual morality at all, but merely a low barbaric view, quite
insufficiently differentiated. In the Middle Ages, usury was considered
absolutely despicable, for at that time the morality of finance was
not casuistically differentiated; there was nothing but a kind of
lump-morality. So nowadays, there exists nothing but sexual morality in
the lump. A girl who has an illegitimate child is condemned, without
any inquiry as to whether she is a decent person or not. Any form of
love that has no legal sanction is immoral, no matter whether it occurs
between thoughtful people of value or irresponsible scamps. People are
still barbarically hypnotised by the thing itself, to such an extent
that they forget the individual.

Therefore the discussion of and attack upon sexual morality of the
present day signifies at bottom, a moral deed, constraining people
towards a differentiated and really ethical conception of the subject.

As already stated, Freud sees the great conflict between the ego
and natural instinct chiefly under its sexual aspect. This aspect
does exist, but a big query should be placed behind its actuality.
The question is whether what appears in a sexual form must always
essentially be sexuality? It is conceivable that one instinct may
disguise itself under another. Freud himself has supplied several
notable instances of such a disguise, proving therewith, convincingly,
that many of the deeds and aims of human kind are, at bottom, nothing
but somewhat figurative expressions substituted, on account of
embarrassment, in place of important elementary things. The substitution
is not seen through on account of reasons of mutual consideration.
There is nothing to hinder certain elementary things being also pushed
conveniently into the foreground, in place of more necessary but less
pleasant ones, under the illusion that the elementary things only are
really in question.

_The theory of sexuality although one-sided is absolutely right up to
a certain point. It would, therefore, be just as false to repudiate it
as to accept it as universally valid._
