## _Semi-Somnambulism._
--In S. W.'s case the following condition was
indicated by the term semi-somnambulism. For some time after and before
the actual somnambulic attack the patient finds herself in a state
whose most salient feature can best be described as "preoccupation."
She only lends half an ear to the conversation around her, answers at
random, often gets absorbed in all manner of hallucinations; her face
is solemn, her look ecstatic, visionary, ardent. Closer observation
discloses a far-reaching alteration of the entire character. She is
now serious, dignified; when she speaks her subject is always an
extremely serious one. In this condition she can talk so seriously,
forcibly and convincingly, that one is tempted to ask oneself if this is
really a girl of fifteen and a half. One has the impression of a mature
woman possessed of considerable dramatic talent. The reason for this
seriousness, this solemnity of behaviour, is given in her explanation
that at these times she stands at the frontier of this world and the
other, and associates just as truly with the spirits of the dead as
with living people. And, indeed, her conversation is usually divided
between answers to real objective questions and hallucinatory ones. I
call this state semi-somnambulism because it coincides with Richet's
own definition. He[25] says: "La conscience de cet individu persiste
dans son intégrité apparente, toutefois des opérations très compliquées
vont s'accomplir en dehors de la conscience sans que le moi volontaire
et conscient paraisse ressentir une modification quelconque. Une autre
personne sera en lui qui agira, pensera, voudra, sans que la conscience,
c'est à dire le moi réfléchi conscient, aît la moindre notion."

Binet[26] says of this term: "Le terme indique la parenté de cet état
avec le somnambulisme véritable, et en suite il laisse comprendre que
la vie somnambulique qui se manifeste durant la veille est réduite,
déprimée, par la conscience normale qui la recouvre."
