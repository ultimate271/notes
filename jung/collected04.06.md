## AUTOMATISMS.

Semi-somnambulism is characterised by the continuity of consciousness
with that of the waking state and by the appearance of various
automatisms which give evidence of an activity of the subconscious self,
independent of that of consciousness.

Our case shows the following automatic phenomena:

(1) Automatic movements of the table.

(2) Automatic writing.

(3) Hallucinations.

1. _Automatic Movements of the Table._--Before the patient came
under my observation she had been influenced by the suggestion of
"table-turning," which she had first come across as a game. As soon as
she entered the circle there appeared communications from members of
her family which showed her to be a medium. I could only find out that,
as soon as ever her hand was placed on the table, the typical movements
began. The resulting communications have no interest for us. But the
automatic character of the act itself deserves some discussion, for
we may, without more ado, set aside the imputation that there was any
question of intentional and voluntary pushing or pulling on the part of
the patient.

As we know from the investigations of Chevreul,[27] Gley, Lehmann
and others, unconscious motor phenomena are not only of frequent
occurrence among hysterical persons, and those pathologically inclined
in other directions, but they are also relatively easily produced in
normal persons who show no other spontaneous automatisms. I have made
many experiments on these lines, and can confirm this observation.
In the great majority of instances all that is required is enough
patience to put up with an hour of quiet waiting. In most subjects,
motor automatisms will be obtained in a more or less high degree if
contra-suggestions do not intervene as obstacles. In a relatively small
percentage the phenomena arise spontaneously, _i.e._ directly under
the influence of verbal suggestion or of some earlier auto-suggestion.
In this instance the case is powerfully affected by suggestion. In
general, the particular predisposition is subject to all those laws
which also hold good for normal hypnosis. Nevertheless, certain
special circumstances are to be taken into account, conditioned by the
peculiarity of the case. It is not a question of a total hypnosis, but
of a partial one, limited entirely to the motor area of the arm, like
the cerebral anæsthesia produced by "magnetic passes" for a painful spot
in the body. We touch the spot in question employing verbal suggestion
or making use of some existing auto-suggestion, using the tactile
stimulus which we know acts suggestively, to bring about the desired
partial hypnosis. In accordance with this procedure, refractory subjects
can be brought easily enough to an exhibition of automatism. The
experimenter intentionally gives the table a slight push, or, better, a
series of rhythmic but very slight taps. After a short time he notices
that the oscillations become stronger, that they continue although
he has interrupted his own intentional movements. The experiment has
succeeded, the subject has unsuspectingly taken up the suggestion. By
this procedure much more is obtained than by verbal suggestion. In very
receptive persons and in all those cases where movement seems to arise
spontaneously, the purposeful tremulous movements,[28] not perceptible
by the subject, assume the _rôle_ of _agent provocateur_.

In this way persons who, by themselves, have never obtained automatic
movements of a coarse calibre, sometimes assume the unconscious guidance
of the table-movements, provided that the tremors are strong and that
the medium understands their meaning. In this case the medium takes
control of the slight oscillations and returns them considerably
strengthened, but rarely at exactly the same instant, generally a
few seconds later, in this way revealing the agent's conscious or
unconscious thought. By means of this simple mechanism there may arise
those cases of thought-reading so bewildering at first sight. A very
simple experiment, that succeeds in many cases even with unpractised
persons, will serve to illustrate this. The experimenter thinks, say,
of the number _four_, and then waits, his hands quietly resting on
the table, until he feels that the table makes the first inclination
to announce the number thought of. He lifts his hands off the table
immediately, and the number _four_ will be correctly tilted out. It
is advisable in this experiment to place the table upon a soft thick
carpet. By close attention the experimenter will occasionally notice a
movement of the table which is thus represented.

(1) Purposeful tremors too slight to be perceived by the subject.

(2) Several very small but perceptible oscillations of the table which
indicate that the subject is responding to them.

(3) The big movements (tilts) of the table, giving the number four that
was thought of.

(_ab_) Denotes the moment when the operator's hands are removed.

This experiment succeeds excellently with well-disposed but
inexperienced subjects. After a little practice the phenomenon indicated
is wont to disappear, since by practice the number is read and
reproduced directly from the purposeful movements.[29]

In a responsive medium these purposeful tremors of the experimenter
act just as the intentional taps in the experiment cited above; they
are received, strengthened and reproduced, although slightly wavering.
Still they are perceptible and hence act suggestively as slight tactile
stimuli, and by the increase of partial hypnosis give rise to great
automatic movements. This experiment illustrates in the clearest way
the increase step by step of auto-suggestion. Along the path of this
auto-suggestion are developed all the automatic phenomena of a motor
nature. How the intellectual content gradually mingles in with the
purely motor need scarcely be elucidated after this discussion. There
is no need of a special suggestion for the evoking of intellectual
phenomena. From the outset it is a question of word-presentation, at
least from the side of the experimenter. After the first aimless motor
irrelevancies of the unpractised subject, some word-products or the
intentions of the experimenter are soon reproduced. Objectively the
occurrence of an intellectual content must be understood as follows:--

By the gradual increase of auto-suggestion the motor-range of the arm
becomes isolated from consciousness, that is to say, the perception of
the slight movement-impulse is concealed from consciousness.[30]

By the knowledge gained from consciousness that some intellectual
content is possible, there results a collateral excitation in the
speech-area as the means immediately at hand for intellectual
notification. The motor part of word-presentation is necessarily
chiefly concerned with this aiming at notification.[31] In this way
we understand the unconscious flowing over of speech-impulse to the
motor-area[32] and conversely the gradual penetration of partial
hypnosis into the speech-area.

In numerous experiments with beginners, as a rule I have observed
at the beginning of intellectual phenomena a relatively large number
of completely meaningless words, also often a series of meaningless
single letters. Later on, all kinds of absurdities are produced, _e.g._
words or entire sentences with the letters irregularly misplaced or
with the order of the letters all reversed--a kind of mirror-writing.
The appearance of the letter or word indicates a new suggestion; some
sort of association is involuntarily joined to it, which is then
realised. Remarkably enough, these are not generally the conscious
associations, but quite unexpected ones, a circumstance showing that a
considerable part of the speech-area is already hypnotically isolated.
The recognition of this automatism again forms a fruitful suggestion,
since invariably at this moment the feeling of strangeness arises, if it
is not already present in the pure motor-automatism. The question, "Who
is doing this?" "Who is speaking?", is the suggestion for the synthesis
of the unconscious personality which as a rule does not like being kept
waiting too long. Any name is introduced, generally one charged with
emotion, and the automatic splitting of the personality is accomplished.
How accidental and how vacillating this synthesis is at its beginning,
the following reports from the literature show. Myers[33] communicates
the following interesting observation on a Mr. A., a member of the
Society for Psychical Research, who was making experiments on himself in
automatic writing.


THIRD DAY.

Question: What is man?

Answer: TEFI H HASL ESBLE LIES.

Is that an anagram? Yes.

How many words does it contain? Five.

What is the first word? SEE.

What is the second word? SEEEE.

See? Shall I interpret it myself? Try to.

Mr. A. found this solution: "Life is less able." He was astonished
at this intellectual information, which seemed to him to prove the
existence of an intelligence independent of his own. Therefore he went
on to ask:

Who are you? Clelia.

Are you a woman? Yes.

Have you ever lived upon the earth? No.

Will you come to life? Yes.

When? In six years.

Why are you conversing with me? E if Clelia el.

Mr. A. interpreted this answer as: I Clelia feel.


FOURTH DAY.

Question: Am I the one who asks the questions? Yes.

Is Clelia there? No.

Who is here then? Nobody.

Does Clelia exist at all? No.

With whom then was I speaking yesterday? With no one.

       *       *       *       *       *

Janet[34] conducted the following conversation with the subconsciousness
of Lucie, who, meanwhile, was engaged in conversation with another
observer. "M'entendez-vous?" asks Janet. Lucie answers by automatic
writing, "Non." "Mais pour répondre il faut entendre?" "Oui,
absolument." "Alors comment faites-vous?" "Je ne sais." "Il faut bien
qu'il y ait quelqu'un qui m'entend?" "Oui." "Qui cela! Autre que Lucie.
Eh bien! Une autre personne. Voulez-vous que nous lui donnions un
nom?" "Non." "Si, ce sera plus commode," "Eh bien, Adrienne!" "Alors,
Adrienne, m'entendez-vous?" "Oui."

From these quotations it will be seen in what way the subconscious
personality is constructed. It owes its origin purely to suggestive
questions meeting a certain disposition of the medium. The explanation
is the result of the disintegration of the psychical complex; the
feeling of the strangeness of such automatisms then comes in to help, as
soon as conscious attention is directed to the automatic act. Binet[35]
remarks on this experiment of Janet's: "Il faut bien remarquer que si
la personnalité d'Adrienne a pu se créer, c'est qu'elle a rencontré
une possibilité psychologique; en d'autres termes, il y avait là des
phénomènes désagrégés vivant séparés de la conscience normale du
sujet." The individualisation of the subconsciousness always denotes a
considerable further step of great suggestive influence upon the further
formation of automatisms.[36] So, too, we must regard the origin of the
unconscious personalities in our case.

The objection that there is simulation in automatic table-turning may
well be given up, when one considers the phenomenon of thought-reading
from the purposeful tremors which the patient offered in such plenitude.
Rapid, conscious thought-reading demands at the least an extraordinary
degree of practice, which it has been shown the patient did not
possess. By means of the purposeful tremors whole conversations can
be carried on, as in our case. In the same way the suggestibility
of the subconscious can be proved objectively if, for instance, the
experimenter with his hand on the table desires that the hand of
the medium should no longer be able to move the table or the glass;
contrary to all expectation and to the liveliest astonishment of
the subject, the table will immediately remain immovable. Naturally
any other desired suggestions can be realised, provided they do not
overstep by their innervations the region of partial hypnosis; this
proves at the same time the limited nature of the hypnosis. Suggestions
for the legs and the other arm will thus not be obeyed. Table-turning
was not an automatism which belonged exclusively to the patient's
semi-somnambulism: on the contrary, it occurred in the most pronounced
form in the waking state, and in most cases then passed over into
semi-somnambulism, the appearance of this being generally announced by
hallucinations, as it was at the first sitting.

2. _Automatic Writing._--A second automatic phenomenon, which at
the outset corresponds to a higher degree of partial hypnosis, is
automatic writing. It is, according to my experience, much rarer and
more difficult to produce than table-turning. As in table-turning,
it is again a matter of a primary suggestion, to the conscious when
sensibility is retained, to the unconscious when it is obliterated.
The suggestion is, however, not a simple one, for it already bears in
itself an intellectual element. "To write" means "to write something."
This special element of the suggestion, which extends beyond the
merely motor, often conditions a certain perplexity on the part of the
subject, giving rise to slight contrary suggestions which hinder the
appearance of the automatisms. I have observed in a few cases that the
suggestion is realised, despite its relative venturesomeness (_e.g._
one directed towards the waking consciousness of a so-called normal
person). However, it takes place in a peculiar way; it first displaces
the purely motor part of the central system concerned in hypnosis, and
the deeper hypnosis is then reached by auto-suggestion from the motor
phenomenon, analogous to the procedure in table-turning described above.
The subject,[37] who has a pencil in his hand, is purposely engaged in
conversation whilst his attention is diverted from the writing. The hand
begins to make movements, beginning with many upward strokes and zigzag
lines, or a simple line is made. Occasionally it happens that the pencil
does not touch the paper, but writes in the air. These movements must be
conceived as purely motor phenomena, which correspond to the expression
of the motor element in the presentation "write." This phenomenon is
somewhat rare; generally single letters are first written, and what was
said above of table-turning holds true of their combination into words
and sentences. True mirror-writing is also observed here and there. In
the majority of cases, and perhaps in all experiments with beginners
who are not under some very special suggestion, the automatic writing
is that of the subject. Occasionally its character may be greatly
changed,[38] but this is secondary, and is always to be regarded as a
symptom of the intruding synthesis of a subconscious personality.

[Illustration: FIG. 3.]

As stated, the patient's automatic writing never came to any very great
development. In these experiments, generally carried out in darkness,
she passed over into semi-somnambulism, or into ecstasy. The automatic
writing had thus the same effect as the preliminary table-turning.

3. _The Hallucinations._--The nature of the passing into somnambulism
in the second séance is of psychological importance. As stated, the
automatic phenomena were progressing favourably when darkness came on.
The most interesting event of this séance, so far, was the brusque
interruption of the communication from the grandfather, which was the
starting-point of various debates amongst the members of the circle.
These two momentous occurrences, the darkness and the striking event,
seem to have been the foundation for a rapid deepening of hypnosis,
in consequence of which the hallucinations could be developed. The
psychological mechanism of this process seems to be as follows. The
influence of darkness upon the suggestibility of the sense-organs
is well known.[39] Binet[40] states that it has a special influence
on hysterics, producing a state of sleepiness. As is clear from the
foregoing, the patient was in a state of partial hypnosis and had
constituted herself one with the unconscious personality in closest
relationship to her in the domain of speech. The automatic expression
of this personality is interrupted most unexpectedly by a new person,
of whose existence no one had any suspicion. Whence came this cleavage?
Obviously the eager expectation of this first séance had very much
occupied the patient. Her reminiscences of me and my family had probably
grouped themselves around this expectation; hence these suddenly come
to light at the climax of the automatic expression. That it was just
my grandfather and no one else--not, _e.g._, my deceased father, who,
as she knew, was much closer to me than the grandfather whom I had
never known--perhaps suggests where the origin of this new person
is to be sought. It is probably a dissociation of the personality
already present which seized upon the material next at hand for its
expression, namely, upon the associations concerning myself. How far
this is parallel to the experiences revealed by dream investigation
(Freud's[41]) must remain undecided, for we have no means of judging how
far the effect mentioned can be considered a "repressed" one. From the
brusque interruption of the new personality, we may conclude that the
presentations concerned were very vivid, with corresponding intensity
of expectation. This perhaps was an attempt to overcome a certain
maidenly shyness and embarrassment. This event reminds us vividly of the
manner in which the dream presents to consciousness, by a more or less
transparent symbolism, things one has never said to oneself clearly and
openly. We do not know when this dissociation of the new personality
occurred, whether it had been slowly prepared in the unconscious,
or whether it first occurred in the séance. In any case, this event
meant a considerable increase in the extension of the unconscious
sphere rendered accessible through the hypnosis. At the same time
this event must be regarded as powerfully suggestive in regard to the
impression which it made upon the waking consciousness of the patient.
For the perception of this unexpected intervention of a new power must
inevitably excite a feeling of the strangeness of the automatisms,
and would easily suggest the thought that an independent spirit is
here making itself known. Hence the intelligible association that she
would finally be able to see this spirit. The situation that ensued
at the second séance is to be explained by the coincidence of this
energising suggestion with the heightened suggestibility conditioned
by the darkness. The hypnosis, and with it the series of dissociated
presentations, break through to the visual area, and the expression of
the unconscious, hitherto purely motor, is made objective, according
to the measure of the specific energy of the new system, in the shape
of visual images with the character of hallucinations; not as a mere
accompanying phenomenon of the word-automatism, but as a substituted
function. The explanation of the situation that arose in the first
séance, at that time unexpected and inexplicable, is no longer presented
in words, but as a descriptive allegorical vision. The sentence "they
do not hate one another, but are friends," is expressed in a picture.
We often encounter events of this kind in somnambulism. The thinking of
somnambulists is given in plastic images which constantly break into
this or that sense-sphere and are made objective in hallucinations. The
process of reflection sinks into the subconscious; only its end-results
arise to consciousness either as presentations vividly tinged by the
senses, or directly as hallucinations. In our case the same thing
occurred as in the patient whose anæsthetic hand Binet pricked nine
times, making her think of the figure 9; or as in Flournoy's[42] Helen
Smith, who, when asked during business-hours about certain patterns,
suddenly saw the number of days (18) for which they had been lent, at
a length of 20 mm. in front of her. The further question arises, why
does the automatism appear in the visual and not in the acoustic sphere?
There are several grounds for this choice of the visual sphere.

(1) The patient is not gifted acoustically; she is, for instance, very
unmusical.

(2) There was no stillness corresponding to the darkness which might
have favoured the appearance of sounds; there was a lively conversation.

(3) The increased conviction of the near presence of spirits, because
the automatism felt so strange, could easily have aroused the idea that
a spirit might be seen, thus causing a slight excitation of the visual
sphere.

(4) The entoptic phenomena in darkness favoured the occurrence of
hallucinations.

The reasons (3) and (4)--the entoptic phenomena in the darkness and the
probable excitation of the visual sphere--are of decisive importance
for the appearance of hallucinations. The entoptic phenomena in this
case play the same rôle in the auto-suggestion, the production of
the automatism, as the slight tactile stimuli in hypnosis of the
motor centre. As stated, flashes preceded the first hallucinatory
twilight-state. Obviously attention was already at a high pitch, and
directed to visual perceptions, so that the retina's own light, usually
very weak, was seen with great intensity. The part played by entoptic
perceptions of light in the origin of hallucinations deserves further
consideration. Schüle[43] says: "The swarming of light and colour which
stimulates and animates the field of vision, although in the dark,
supplies the material for phantastic figures in the air before falling
asleep. As we know, absolute darkness is never seen; a few particles
of the dark field of vision are always illumined; flecks of light move
here and there, and combine into all kinds of figures; it only needs a
moderately active imagination to create out of them, as one does out
of clouds, certain known figures. The power of reasoning, fading as one
falls asleep, leaves phantasy free play to construct very vivid figures.
In the place of the light spots, haziness and changing colours of the
dark visual field, there arise definite outlines of objects."[44]

In this way hypnagogic hallucinations arise. The chief _rôle_ naturally
belongs to the imagination, hence imaginative people in particular are
subject to hypnagogic hallucinations.[45] The hypnopompic hallucinations
described by Myers arise in the same way.

It is highly probable that hypnagogic pictures are identical with
the dream-pictures of normal sleep--forming their visual foundation.
Maury[46] has proved from self-observation that the pictures which
hovered around him hypnagogically were also the objects of the
dreams that followed. G. Trumbull Ladd[47] has shown this even more
convincingly. By practice he succeeded in waking himself suddenly two
to five minutes after falling asleep. He then observed that the figures
dancing before the retina at times represented the same contours as
the pictures just dreamed of. He even states that nearly every visual
dream is shaped by the retina's own light-figures. In our case the
fantastic rendering of these pictures was favoured by the situation. We
must not underrate the influence of the over-excited expectation which
allowed the dull retina-light to appear with increased intensity.[48]
The further formation of the retinal appearances follows in accordance
with the predominating presentations. That hallucinations appear in this
way has been also observed in other visionaries. Jeanne d'Arc[49] first
saw a cloud of light, and only after some time there stepped forth St.
Michael, St. Catherine and St. Margaret. For a whole hour Swedenborg[50]
saw nothing but illuminated spheres and fiery flames. He felt a mighty
change in the brain, which seemed to him "release of light." After
the space of one hour he suddenly saw red figures which he regarded
as angels and spirits. The sun visions of Benvenuto Cellini[51] in
Engelsburg are probably of the same nature. A student who frequently saw
apparitions stated: "When these apparitions come, at first I only see
single masses of light and at the same time am conscious of a dull noise
in the ears. Gradually these contours become clear figures."

The appearance of hallucinations occurred in a quite classical way
in Flournoy's Helen Smith. I quote the cases in question from his
article.[52]

"18 Mars. Tentative d'expérience dans l'obscurité. Mlle. Smith voit un
ballon tantôt luminieux, tantôt s'obscurcissant.

"25 Mars. Mlle. Smith commence à distinguer de vagues lueurs, de
longs rubans blancs, s'agitant du plancher au plafond, puis enfin une
magnifique étoile qui dans l'obscurité s'est montrée à elle seule
pendant toute la séance.

"1 Avril. Mlle. Smith se sent très agitée, elle a des frissons, est
partiellement glacée. Elle est très inquiète et voit tout à coup se
balançant au-dessus de la table une figure grimaçante et très laide avec
de longs cheveux rouges. Elle voit alors un magnifique bouquet de roses
de nuances diverses; tout à coup elle voit sortir de dessous le bouquet
un petit serpent, qui, rampant doucement, vient sentir les fleurs, les
regarde," etc.

Helen Smith[53] says in regard to the origin of her vision of March:

"La lueur rouge persista autour de moi et je me suis trouvée entourée de
fleurs extraordinaires."

At all times the complex hallucinations of visionaries have occupied
a peculiar place in scientific criticism. Macario[54] early separated
these so-called intuition-hallucinations from others, since he maintains
that they occur in persons of an eager mind, deep understanding and high
nervous excitability. Hecker[55] expresses himself similarly but more
enthusiastically.

His view is that their condition is "the congenital high development
of the spiritual organ which calls into active, free and mobile play
the life of the imagination, bringing it spontaneous activity." These
hallucinations are "precursors or signs of mighty spiritual power." The
vision is "an increased excitation which is harmoniously adapted to
the most complete health of mind and body." The complex hallucinations
do not belong to the waking state, but prefer as a rule a partial
waking state. The visionary is buried in his vision even to complete
annihilation. Flournoy was also always able to prove in the visions
of H.S. "un certain degré d'obnubilation." In our case the vision is
complicated by a state of sleep whose peculiarities we shall review
later.
