# ANCIENT MYTHS AND MODERN MAN Joseph L. Henderson
this page Concerning the finality of Christ’s resurrection: Christianity is an
eschatological religion, meaning it has a final end in view that becomes
synonymous with the Last Judgment. Other religions, in which matriarchal
elements of tribal culture are preserved (e.g., Orphism), are cyclical, as
demonstrated by Eliades in The Myth of the Eternal Return, New York,
Bollingen-Pantheon, 1954.
