SYMBOLS IN AN INDIVIDUAL ANALYSIS Jolande Jacobi
# SYMBOLS IN AN INDIVIDUAL ANALYSIS Jolande Jacobi
this page The Palace of Dreams: a 16th-century illustration to Book XIX of
Homer’s Odyssey. In the center niche stands the goddess of sleep holding a
bouquet of poppy flowers. On her right is the Gate of Horn (with the head of a
horned ox above it); from this gate come true dreams: on her left the Gate of
Ivory with an elephant’s head above; from this gate come false dreams. Top
left, the goddess of the moon Diana; top right, Night, with the infants Sleep
and Death.

this page The importance of the first dream in an analysis is indicated by Jung
in Modern Man in Search of a Soul, p. 77.

this page Regarding the section on the Oracle Dream, see the I Ching or Book of
Changes, trans. Richard Wilhelm (with an introduction by C. G. Jung), Routledge
& Kegan Paul, London, 1951, vols. I and II.

this page The symbolism in the three upper lines of the sign Meng—the “gate”—is
mentioned in op. cit., vol. II, p. 299, which also states that this sign “… is
a bypath; it means little stones, doors and openings … eunuchs and watchmen,
the fingers …” For the sign Meng, see also vol. I, p. 20 ff.

this page The quotation from the I Ching is in vol. I, p. 23.

this page Concerning a second consulting of the I Ching, Jung writes (in his
Introduction to the English edition, p. x): “A repetition of the experiment is
impossible for the simple reason that the original situation cannot be be
reconstructed. Therefore in each instance there is only a first and single
answer.”

this page The motif of the “city on the mountain” is discussed by K. Kerenyi in
Das Geheimnis der hohen Städte, Europäische Revue, 1942, Juli-August-Heft; and
in Essays on a Science of Mythology, Bollingen Series XXIII, p. 16.

this page Jung’s discussion of the motif of four appears, for instance, in his
Collected Works vols. IX, XI, XII, and XIV; but the problem of the four, with
all its implications, is woven like a red thread through all his works.

Handwörterbuch des Deutschen Aberglaubens, vol. IV, p. 1015, and vol. V, Op.
1110.

this page The symbolism of the number nine is discussed in (among other works)
F. V. Hopper’s Medieval Number Symbolism, 1938, p. 138.

this page Concerning the “night-sea-journey” pattern of this dream, see J.
Jacobi, “The Process of Individuation,” Journal of Analytical Psychology, vol.
III, no. 2, 1958, p. 95.

this page The primitive belief in the power of bodily secretions is discussed
by E. Neumann in Origins of Consciousness (German edition), p. 39.
