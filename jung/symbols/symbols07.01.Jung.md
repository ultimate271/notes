# APPROACHING THE UNCONSCIOUS Carl G. Jung
this page Nietzsche’s cryptomnesia is discussed in Jung’s “On the Psychology of
So-called Occult Phenomena,” in Collected Works vol. I. The relevant passage
from the ship’s log and the corresponding passage from Nietzsche are as
follows:

From J. Kerner, Blütter aus Prevorst, vol. IV, p. 57, headed “An Extract of
Awe-inspiring Import …” (orig. 1831–37): “The four captains and a merchant, Mr.
Bell, went ashore on the island of Mount Stromboli to shoot rabbits. At three
o’clock they mustered the crew to go aboard, when, to their inexpressible
astonishment, they saw two men flying rapidly toward them through the air. One
was dressed in black, the other in grey. They came past them very closely, in
greatest haste, and to their utmost dismay descended into the crater of the
terrible volcano, Mount Stromboli. They recognized the pair as acquaintances
from London.”

From F. Nietzsche, Thus Spake Zarathustra, chapter xl, “Great Events”
(translated by Common, p. 180, slightly modified), orig. 1883: “Now about the
time that Zarathustra sojourned on the Happy Isles, it happened that a ship
anchored at the isle on which the smoking mountain stands, and the crew went
ashore to shoot rabbits. About the noon-tide hour, however, when the captain
and his men were together again, they suddenly saw a man coming toward them
through the air, and a voice said distinctly: ‘It is time! It is highest time!’

But when the figure drew close to them, flying past quickly like a shadow in
the direction of the volcano, they recognized with the greatest dismay that it
was Zarathustra … ‘Behold,’ said the old helmsman, ‘Zarathustra goes down to
hell!’ ”

this page Robert Louis Stevenson discusses his dream of Jekyll and Hyde in “A
Chapter on Dreams” from his Across the Plain.

this page A more detailed account of Jung’s dream is given in Memories, Dreams,
Reflections of C. G. Jung, ed. Aniela Jaffé, New York, Pantheon, 1962.

this page Examples of the state of subliminal ideas and images can be found in
Pierre Janet’s works.

this page Further examples of cultural symbols appear in Mircea Eliade’s Der
Schamanismus, Zurich, 1947.
