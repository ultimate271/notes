SCIENCE AND THE UNCONSCIOUS M.-L. von Franz
# SCIENCE AND THE UNCONSCIOUS M.-L. von Franz
this page The archetypes as nuclei of the psyche are discussed by W. Pauli in
Aufsätze und Vorträge über Physik und Erkenntnis-theorie, Verlag Vieweg
Braunschweig, 1961.

this page Concerning the inspiring or inhibiting power of the archetypes, see
C. G. Jung and W. Pauli, Naturerklärung und Psyche, Zurich, 1952, p. 163 and
passim.

this page Pauli’s suggestion concerning biology appears in Aufsätze und
Vorträge, op. cit., p. 123.

this page For further explanation of the statement concerning the time required
for mutation, see Pauli, l.c., pp. 123–25.

this page The story of Darwin and Wallace can be found in Henshaw Ward’s
Charles Darwin, 1927.

this page The reference to Descartes is expanded in M.-L. von Franz’s “Der
Traum des Descartes,” in Studien des C. G. Jung Instituts, called “Zeitlose
Dokuments der Seele.”

this page Kepler’s assertion is discussed by Jung and Pauli in Naturerklärung
und Psyche, l.c., p. 117.

this page Heisenberg’s phrase was quoted by Hannah Arendt in The Human
Condition, Chicago Univ. Press, 1958, p. 26.

this page Pauli’s suggestion of parallel psychological and physical studies
appears in Naturerklärung, l.c., p. 163.

this page For Niels Bohr’s ideas of complementarity, see his Atomphysik und
menschliche Erkenntnis, Braunschweig, p. 26 ff.

this page “Momentum” (of a subatomic particle) is, in German, Bewegungsgrösse.

this page The statement quoted from Pauli was quoted by Jung in “The Spirit of
Psychology,” in Jos. Campbell’s Coll. Papers of the Eranos Year Book, Bollingen
Series XXX, 1, N.Y. Pantheon Books, 1954, p. 439.

this page Pauli discusses the “primary possibilities” in Vorträge, l.c., p.
125.

this page The parallels between microphysics and psychological concepts also
appear in Vorträge: the description of the unconscious by paradoxes, pp.
115–16; the archetypes as “primary possibilities.” p. 115; the unconscious as a
“field,” p. 125.

this page The quotation from Gauss is translated from his Werke, vol. X, p. 25,
letter to Olbers, and is quoted in B. L. van der Waerden, Einfall und
Ueberlegung: Drei kleine Beiträge zur Psychologie des mathematischen Denkens,
Basel, 1954.

this page Poincaré’s statement is quoted in ibid., p. 2.

this page Pauli’s belief that the concept of the unconscious would affect all
natural sciences is in Vorträge, p. 125.

this page The idea of the possible one-ness of life phenomena was taken up by
Pauli, ibid., p. 118.

this page For Jung’s ideas on the “synchronistic arrangement” including matter
and psyche, see his “Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle,” Coll.
Works vol. VIII.

this page Jung’s idea of the unus mundus follows some medieval philosophic
ideas in scholasticism (John Duns Scotus, etc.): The unus mundus was the total
or archetypal concept of the world in God’s mind before he put it into actual
reality.

this page The quotation from Hannah Arendt appears in The Human Condition,
l.c., p. 266.

this page For further discussion of “primary mathematical intuitions,” see
Pauli, Vorträge, p. 122; and also Ferd. Conseth, “Les mathematiques et la
réalité,” 1948.

this page Pauli, following Jung, points out that our conscious representations
are “ordered” before becoming conscious in Vorträge, p. 122. See also Conseth,
l.c.

this page B. L. van der Waerden’s statement is from his Einfall und
Ueberlegung, l.c., p. 9.
