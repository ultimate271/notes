## CHAPTER XIV

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE UNCONSCIOUS PROCESSES[216]

_Being a Survey of the Modern Theory and Method of Analytical Psychology_


I.--THE BEGINNINGS OF PSYCHOANALYSIS

In common with other sciences, psychology had to go through its
scholastic-philosophic stage, and to some extent this has lasted on
into the present time. This philosophic psychology has incurred our
condemnation in that it decides _ex cathedra_ what is the nature of the
soul, and whence and how it derives its attributes. The spirit of modern
scientific investigation has summarily disposed of all these phantasies
and in their place has established an exact empiric method. We owe to
this our present-day experimental psychology or "_psychophysiology_,"
as the French call it. This new direction originated with Fechner,
that Janus-minded spirit, who in his remarkable _Psychophysik_ (1860)
embarked on the mighty enterprise of introducing the physical standpoint
into the conception of psychical phenomena. The whole idea of this
work--and not least its astonishing mistakes--proved most fruitful in
results. For Wundt, Fechner's young contemporary, carried on his work,
and it is Wundt's great erudition, enormous power of work and genius for
elaborating methods of experimental research, which have given to modern
psychology its prevailing direction.

Until quite recently experimental psychology remained essentially
academic. The first notable attempt to utilise some few at any rate
of its innumerable experimental methods in the service of practical
psychology came from the psychiatrists of the former Heidelberg school
(Kræpelin, Aschaffenburg, etc.); it is quite intelligible that the
psychotherapists should be the first to feel the urgent need for more
exact knowledge of psychic processes.

Next came pedagogy, making its own demands upon psychology. Out of this
has recently grown up an "experimental pedagogy," and in this field
Neumann in Germany and Binet in France have rendered signal services.
The physician, the so-called "nerve-specialist," has the most urgent
need of psychological knowledge if he would really help his patients,
for neurotic disturbances, such as hysteria, and all things classed as
"nervousness," are of psychic origin, and necessarily demand psychic
treatment. Cold water, light, air, electricity, magnetism, etc., are
only effective temporarily, and quite often are of no use at all. They
are frequently introduced into treatment in a not very commendable
fashion, simply because reliance is placed upon their suggestive effect.
But it is in his soul that the patient is really sick; in those most
complicated and lofty functions which we scarcely dare to include in
the province of medicine. The doctor must needs, in such a case, be a
psychologist, must needs understand the human soul. He cannot evade the
urgent demand upon him. So he naturally turns for help to psychology,
since his psychiatry text-books have nothing to offer him. But modern
experimental psychology is very far from being able to afford him any
connected insight into the most vital psychic processes, that is not
its aim. As far as possible it tries to isolate those simple elementary
phenomena which border on the physiological, and then study them in an
isolated state. It quite ignores the infinite variation and movement of
the mental life of the individual, and accordingly, its knowledge and
its facts are so many isolated details, uninspired by any comprehensive
idea capable of bringing them into co-ordination. Hence it comes about
that the inquirer after the secrets of the human soul, learns rather
less than nothing from experimental psychology. He would be better
advised to abandon exact science, take off his scholar's gown, say
farewell to his study, and then, strong in manly courage, set out to
wander through the world; alike through the horrors of prisons, lunatic
asylums and hospitals, through dreary outlying taverns, through
brothels and gambling-halls, into elegant drawing-rooms, the Stock
Exchanges, socialist meetings, churches, revival gatherings of strange
religious sects, experiencing in his own person love and hate and every
kind of suffering. He would return laden with richer knowledge than his
yard-long text-books could ever have given him, and thus equipped, he
can indeed be a physician to his patients, for he understands the soul
of man. He may be pardoned if his respect for the "corner-stones" of
experimental psychology is no longer very considerable. There is a great
gulf fixed between what science calls "psychology," on the one hand, and
what the practice of everyday life expects from psychology on the other.

This need became the starting-point of a new psychology whose inception
we owe first and foremost to the genius of Sigmund Freud, of Vienna,
to his researches into functional nervous disease. The new type of
psychology might be described as "analytical psychology." Professor
Bleuler has coined the name "Deep Psychology,"[217] to indicate that
the Freudian psychology takes as its province the deeper regions, the
"hinterland" of the soul, the "unconscious." Freud names his method of
investigation "psychoanalysis."

Before we approach the matter more closely, we must first consider the
relationship of the new psychology to the earlier science. Here we
encounter a singular little farce which once again proves the truth of
Anatole France's apothegm: "Les savants ne sont pas curieux."

The first important piece of work[218] in this new field awakened
only the faintest echo, in spite of the fact that it offered a new
and fundamental conception of the neuroses. Certain writers expressed
their approbation, and then, on the next page, proceeded to explain
their cases of hysteria in the good old way. It was much as if a man
should subscribe fully to the idea of the earth's being spherical, and
yet continue to represent it as flat. Freud's next publications[219]
were practically unnoticed, although they contributed findings of
immeasurable importance to the domain of psychiatry. When in 1900 he
produced the first real psychological elucidation of the dream[220]
(previously there had reigned over this territory a suitable nocturnal
darkness), he was ridiculed; and when in the middle of the last decade
he began to illumine the psychology of sexuality itself,[221] and at
the same time the "Zürich school" decided to range itself on his side,
a storm of abuse, sometimes of the coarsest kind, burst upon him, nor
has it yet ceased to rage. At the last South-West German Congress of
alienists in Baden-Baden, the adherents of the new psychology had
the pleasure of hearing Hoche, University Professor of Psychiatry at
Freiburg in Breisgau, describe the movement in a long and much-applauded
address, as an outbreak of mental aberration _among doctors_. The old
proverb: "Medicus medicum non decimat" was here quite put to shame. How
carefully the question had been studied was shewn by the naïve remark
of one of the most distinguished neurologists of Paris, which I myself
heard at the International Congress in 1907: "It is true I have not
read Freud's works (he did not happen to know any German!), but as for
his theories, they are nothing but a "mauvaise plaisanterie." Freud,
dignified, masterly, once said to me, I first became clearly conscious
of the value of my discoveries when they were met everywhere with
resistance and anger; since that time I have judged the value of my work
according to the degree of opposition provoked. It is against my sexual
theory that the greatest indignation is felt, so it would seem therein
lies my best work. Perhaps after all the real benefactors of mankind
are its false teachers, for opposition to the false doctrine pushes men
willy nilly into truth. Your truth-teller is a pernicious fellow, he
drives men into error."

The reader must now calmly accept the idea that in this psychology
he is dealing with something quite unique, if not indeed with some
altogether irrational, sectarian, or occult wisdom; for what else could
possibly provoke all the scientific authorities to turn away on the very
threshold and utterly refuse to cross it?

Accordingly, we must look more closely into this psychology. As long
ago as Charcot's time it was recognised that neurotic symptoms are
"psychogenic," that is, that they have their origin in the psyche.
It was also known, thanks mainly to the work of the Nancy School,
that every hysterical symptom can be exactly reproduced by means of
suggestion. But _how_ a hysterical system arises, and its relationship
to psychic causes, were altogether unknown. In the beginning of the
eighties Dr. Breuer, an old Viennese doctor, made a discovery[222]
which was really the true starting-point of the new psychology.
He had a very intelligent young patient (a woman) suffering from
hysteria, who exhibited the following symptoms among others: A spastic
paralysis of the right arm, occasional disturbances of consciousness
or twilight-states, and loss of the power of speech in so far as she
no longer retained any knowledge of her mother-tongue, and could only
express herself in English (so-called systematic aphasia). They sought
at that time, and still seek, in such a case to establish some theory of
anatomical disturbance, although there was just as little disturbance
in the arm-centre in the brain as in that of any normal man who boxes
another's ears. The symptomatology of hysteria is full of anatomical
impossibilities; such as the case of the lady who had lost her hearing
completely through some hysterical malady. None the less she often used
to sing, and once when she was singing her doctor sat down at the piano
unnoticed by her and softly accompanied her. Passing from one strophe
to another he suddenly altered the key, and she, quite unconscious of
what she was doing, sang on in the altered key. Thus she heard--yet did
not hear. The various forms of systematic blindness present similar
phenomena. We have the case of a man suffering from complete hysterical
blindness. In the course of the treatment he recovers his sight, but at
first, and for some long time, only partially: he could see everything
with one exception--people's heads. He saw all the people around him
without heads. Thus he saw--yet did not see. From a large number of like
experiences it has long been concluded that it is only the patient's
consciousness which does not see, does not hear, but the sense-function
has nothing at all the matter with it. This state of affairs is directly
contradictory to the essence of an organic disturbance, which always
materially involves the function.

After this digression let us return to Breuer's case. Since there was no
organic cause for the disturbance, the case was clearly to be regarded
as hysterical, that is, psychogenic. Dr. Breuer had noticed that if
during her twilight-states (whether spontaneous or artificially induced)
he let the patient freely express the reminiscences and phantasies that
thronged in upon her, her condition was afterwards much improved for
some hours. He made systematic use of this observation in her further
treatment. The patient herself invented the appropriate name for it of
"talking cure" or, in jest, "chimney sweeping."

Her illness began whilst she was nursing her dying father. It is
easy to understand that her phantasies busied themselves mainly with
this disturbing time. In the twilight-states memories of this period
reappeared with photographic fidelity, distinct in every detail: no
waking recollection is ever so plastically and exactly reproduced.
The term hypermnesia is applied to this heightening of the power of
memory, which occurs without difficulty in certain states of contracted
consciousness. Remarkable things now came to light. Out of the many
things told, one ran somewhat as follows.[223]

On a certain night she was in a state of great anxiety about her
father's high temperature. She sat by his bed, waiting for the surgeon
who was coming from Vienna to perform an operation. Her mother had gone
out of the room for a little while, and Anna (the patient) sat by the
bed, with her right arm hanging over the back of her chair. She fell
into a kind of waking-dream in which she saw a black snake come out
from the wall and approach the sick man, prepared to bite. (It is very
probable that some real snakes had been seen in the fields behind the
house, and that she had been frightened by them; this would furnish the
material for her hallucination.) She wanted to drive the creature away,
but felt paralysed; her right arm, hanging over the chair, had "gone to
sleep," was anæsthetic and paretic, and as she looked her fingers turned
into little snakes with death's heads (the nails). Probably she tried
to drive the snake away with her paralysed right hand, and thereby the
anæsthesia and paralysis became associated with the snake-hallucination.
Even after the snake had disappeared, her terror remained great. She
tried to pray, but found she had no words in any language, until at
length she managed to remember some English nursery rhymes, and then she
could go on thinking and praying in that language.

This was the actual scene in which the paralysis and speech-disturbance
arose; the describing it served to remove the speech-trouble, and in
this same fashion the case was finally completely cured.

I must restrict myself to this one instance. In Breuer and Freud's book
there is a wealth of similar examples. It is easy to understand that
scenes such as these make a very strong impression, and accordingly
there is an inclination to attribute a causal significance to them in
the genesis of the symptoms. The then current conception of hysteria,
arising from the English "nervous shock" theory, which Charcot strongly
supported, came in conveniently to elucidate Breuer's discovery,
hence arose the _trauma-theory_ maintaining that the hysterical
symptom and in so far as the symptoms comprise the disease, hysteria
itself, arises from some _psychic injury_ (or _trauma_), the effect
of which is retained in the unconscious indefinitely. Freud, working
as Breuer's colleague, amply confirmed this discovery. It was fully
demonstrated that not one out of the many hundred hysterical symptoms
came down ready made from heaven; they had already been conditioned
by past psychic experiences. To some extent, therefore, this new
conception opened up a field of very important empirical work. But
Freud's tireless spirit of inquiry could not long rest content at
this superficial layer, since already there obtruded deeper and more
difficult problems. It is obvious enough that moments of great fear
and anxiety, such as Breuer's patient went through, would leave behind
a lasting effect, but how is it that these happenings are themselves
already deeply stamped with the mark of morbidity? Must we suppose
that the trying sick-nursing in itself produce such a result? If
so, such effects should occur much more frequently, for there are,
unfortunately, many trying cases of sick-nursing, and the nurse's
nervous constitution is by no means always of the soundest. To this
problem medicine gives its admirable answer; the "x" in the calculation
is _predisposition_; there is a tendency to these things. But for Freud
the problem was, what exactly constitutes this predisposition? This
question led logically to an investigation of all that had preceded the
psychic trauma. It is a matter of common observation that distressing
scenes have markedly different effects upon the different participants,
and that things which to some are quite indifferent or even pleasant,
such as frogs, mice, snakes, cats, excite the greatest aversion in
others. There are the cases of women who can calmly be present at a
very bad operation, but who tremble all over with horror and nausea
at the touch of a cat. By way of illustration let me give the case
of a young lady suffering from severe hysteria following a sudden
fright.[224] She had been at a social gathering, and was on her way
home at midnight accompanied by several acquaintances, when a carriage
came up behind them at full speed. All the others moved out of the way,
but she, beside herself with fright, ran down the middle of the road
just in front of the horses. The coachman cracked his whip and cursed
and swore in vain. She ran down the whole length of the street till
a bridge was reached. There her strength failed her, and to escape
the horses' feet in her despair she would have jumped into the water
had not passers-by prevented her. This same lady happened to be in
Petrograd during that sanguinary Revolution of the 22nd of January, and
saw a street cleared by the volleys of soldiers. All around her people
were dropping down dead or wounded, but she retained her calmness and
self-possession, and caught sight of a door which gave her escape into
another street. These terrible moments agitated her neither at the time
nor later on. She was quite well afterwards, indeed felt better than
usual.

Essentially similar reactions can quite often be observed. Hence
it follows that the intensity of the trauma is of small pathogenic
importance; the peculiar circumstances determine its pathogenic effect.
Here, then, we have the key which enables us to unlock at least one of
the anterooms to an understanding of predisposition. We must now ask
what were the unusual circumstances in this carriage scene? The terror
and apprehension began as soon as the lady heard the trampling horses.
For a moment she thought this portended some terrible fate, her death,
or something equally frightful; the next, she lost all sense of what she
was doing.

This powerful impression was evidently connected in some way with
the horses. The predisposition of the patient to react in such an
exaggerated fashion to a not very remarkable incident, might result
from the fact that horses had some special significance for her. It
might be suspected that she had experienced some dangerous accident
with them; this actually turned out to be the case. When a child of
about seven years old she was out for a drive with the coachman; the
horses shied and galloped at full speed towards a steep river-bank.
The coachman jumped down, and shouted to her to do the same, but in
her extreme terror she could scarcely bring herself to obey. She did,
however, just manage to jump out in the nick of time, whilst the horses
and carriage were dashed to pieces below. No proof is needed that such
an experience must leave a lasting impression behind it. But it does not
offer any explanation for such an exaggerated reaction to an inadequate
stimulus. So far we only know that this later symptom had its prologue
in childhood, but its pathological aspect remains obscure. To penetrate
into the heart of such a mystery it was necessary to accumulate further
material. And the greater our experience the clearer does it become
that in all cases with such traumatic experiences analysed up to the
present, there co-exists a special kind of disturbance which can only be
described as a derangement in the sphere of _love_. Not all of us give
due credit to the anomalous nature of love, reaching high as heaven,
sinking low as hell, uniting in itself all extremes of good and evil, of
lofty and low.[225]

As soon as Freud recognised this, a decisive change came about in his
view. In his earlier researches, whilst more or less dominated by
Charcot's trauma-theory, he had sought for the origin of the neurosis
in actual traumatic experiences; but now the centre of gravity shifted
to a very different point. This is best demonstrated by reference to
our case; we can understand that horses might easily play a significant
part in the patient's life, but it is not clear why there should be this
later reaction, so exaggerated, so uncalled for. It is not her fear of
horses which forms the morbid factor in this curious story; to get at
the real truth we must remember our empirical conclusion, that, side by
side with traumatic experiences, there is also invariably present some
disturbance in the sphere of love. We must now go on to inquire whether
perhaps there is anything unsatisfactory in this respect in the case
under review.

Our patient has a young man friend, to whom she is thinking of becoming
engaged, she loves him and expects to be happy with him. At first
nothing more is discoverable; but the investigator must not let himself
be deterred by a negative result in the beginning of this preliminary
questioning. When the direct way does not lead to the desired end, an
indirect way may be taken. We accordingly turn our attention back to
that strange moment when she ran away in front of the horses. We inquire
who were her companions and what kind of social gathering was it, and
find it was a farewell-party to her best friend, on her departure to a
foreign health-resort on account of a nervous breakdown. We are told
this friend is happily married and is the mother of one child. We may
well doubt the assertion that she is happy. If she really were so, it
is hardly to be supposed she would be "nervous" and in need of a cure.
When I attacked the situation from a different vantage-ground, I learnt
that our patient--after this episode--had been taken by her friends to
the nearest safe place--her host's house. In her exhausted state he
took charge of her. When the patient came to this part of her story,
she suddenly broke off, was embarrassed, fidgeted and tried to turn
the subject. Evidently some disagreeable reminiscences had suddenly
cropped up. After obstinate resistances had been overcome, she admitted
something very strange had happened that night. Her host had made her
a passionate declaration of love, thus occasioning a situation that,
in the absence of his wife, might well be considered both painful and
difficult. Ostensibly this declaration came upon her like a "bolt from
the blue." But a small dose of criticism applied to such an assertion
soon apprises us that these things never do drop suddenly from the sky;
they always have their previous history. It was a task of the following
weeks to dig out piecemeal a long love-story. I will attempt to sketch
in the picture as it appeared finally.

As a child the patient was a thorough tomboy, loved boys' boisterous
games, laughed at her own sex, and would have nothing to do with
feminine ways or occupations. After puberty, just when the sex-issue
should have meant much to her, she began to shun all society; she
seemingly hated and despised everything which could remind her even
remotely of the biological destiny of mankind, and lived in a world of
phantasy which had nothing in common with rude reality. Thus, till her
twenty-fourth year, she escaped all the little adventures, hopes and
expectations which ordinarily move a girl at this age. But finally she
got to know the two men who were destined to destroy the thorny hedge
which had grown up around her. Mr. A. was her best friend's husband;
Mr. B. was their bachelor-friend. She liked both; but pretty soon found
B. the more sympathetic, and an intimacy grew up between them which made
an engagement seem likely. Through her friendship with him and with
Mrs. A., she often met Mr. A. His presence excited her inexplicably,
made her nervous. Just at this time she went to a big party. All her
friends were there. She became lost in thought, and in a reverie was
playing with her ring, when suddenly it slipped out of her hand and
rolled under the table. Both men tried to find it and Mr. B. managed to
get it. With a meaning smile he put the ring back on her finger, and
said, "You know what that means!" Overcome by some strange, irresistible
feeling, she tore the ring from her finger and flung it out of the open
window. Naturally a painful moment for all ensued, and she soon went
away, much depressed. A little while after, so-called chance brought her
for her summer holidays to the health-resort where A. and his wife were
staying. It was then that Mrs. A. began to suffer from nerve-trouble,
and frequently felt too unwell to leave the house. So our patient could
often go out for walks alone with A. One day they were out in a small
boat. She was boisterously merry and fell overboard. Mr. A. saved her
with difficulty as she could not swim, and he managed to lift her into
the boat in a half-unconscious state. Then he kissed her. This romantic
event wove fast the bonds between them. In self-defence she did her best
to get herself engaged to B. and to persuade herself that she loved him.
Of course this queer comedy could not escape the sharp eye of feminine
jealousy. Mrs. A., her friend, guessed the secret, and was so much upset
by it that her nervous condition grew bad enough to necessitate her
trying a cure at a foreign health-resort. At the farewell gathering the
demon came to our patient and whispered: "To-night he will be alone,
something must happen to you so that you can go to his house." And so
indeed it came about; her strange behaviour made her friends take her to
his house, and thus she achieved her desire.

After this explanation the reader will probably be inclined to assume
that only diabolical subtlety could think out and set in motion such a
chain of circumstances. There is no doubt about the subtlety, but the
moral evaluation is less certain. I desire to lay special emphasis upon
the fact that the patient was _in no sense conscious of the motives_ of
this dramatic performance. The incident apparently just came about of
itself without any conscious motive whatsoever. But the whole previous
history makes it perfectly clear that everything was most ingeniously
directed towards the other aim; whilst the conscious self was apparently
working to bring about the engagement to Mr. B., the unconscious
compulsion to take the other road was still stronger.

So once more we must return to our original question, whence comes the
pathological, the peculiar and exaggerated reaction to the trauma?
Relying on a conclusion obtained from other analogous experiences,
we ventured the conjecture that in the present case we had to do
with a disturbance in the love-life, in addition to the trauma. This
supposition was thoroughly borne out; the trauma, which was apparently
the cause of the illness, was merely the _occasion_ for some factor,
till then unconscious, to manifest itself. This was the _significant
erotic conflict_. With this finding the trauma loses its pathogenic
significance and is replaced by a much deeper and more comprehensive
conception, which regards the erotic conflict as the pathogenic agent.
This conception may be described as the sexual theory of the neurosis.

I am often asked why it is just the erotic conflict rather than any
other which is the cause of the neurosis. There is but one answer to
this. No one asserts that this ought necessarily to be the case, but as
a simple matter of fact it is always found to be so, notwithstanding all
the cousins and aunts, godparents, and teachers, who rage against it.
Despite all the indignant assertions to the contrary, the problem and
conflicts of love are of fundamental importance for humanity,[226] and
with increasingly careful study, it comes out ever more clearly that
the love-life is of immensely greater importance than the individual
suspects.

As a consequence of the recognition that the true root of the neurosis
is not the trauma, but the hidden erotic conflict, the trauma loses its
pathogenic significance.
