## THE CONTENT OF THE PSYCHOSES[194]


INTRODUCTION

My short sketch on the Content of the Psychoses which first appeared
in the series of "Schriften zur Angewandten Seelenkunde" under
Freud's editorship was designed to give the non-professional but
interested public some insight into the psychological point of view
of recent psychiatry. I chose by way of example a case of the mental
disorder known as Dementia Præcox, which Bleuler calls Schizophrenia.
Statistically this extensive group contains by far the largest number
of cases of psychosis. Many psychiatrists would prefer to limit it, and
accordingly make use of other nomenclature and classification. From the
psychological standpoint the change of name is unimportant, for it is
of less value to know what a thing is called than to know what it is.
The cases of mental disorder sketched in this essay belong to well-known
and frequently occurring types, familiar to the alienist. The facts will
not be altered if these disorders are called by some other name than
dementia præcox.

I have presented my view of the psychological basis in a work[195]
whose scientific validity has been contested upon all sorts of grounds.
For me it is sufficient justification that a psychiatrist of Bleuler's
standing has fully accepted, in his great monograph on the disease,
all the essential points in my work. The difference between us is as
to the question whether, in relation to the anatomical basis, the
psychological disorders should be regarded as primary or secondary. The
resolution of this weighty question depends upon the general problem as
to whether the prevailing dogma in psychiatry--"disorders of the mind
are disorders of the brain"--presents a final truth or not. This dogma
leads to absolute sterility as soon as universal validity is ascribed
to it. There are undoubted psychogenic mental diseases (the so-called
hysterical) which are properly regarded as _functional_ in contrast
with organic diseases which rest upon demonstrable anatomical changes.
Disorders of the brain should only be called organic when the psychic
symptoms depend upon an undoubtedly primary disease of the brain. Now
in dementia præcox this is by no means a settled question. Definite
anatomical changes are present, but we are very far from being able to
relate the psychological symptoms to these changes. We have, at least,
positive information as to the functional nature of early schizophrenic
conditions; moreover the organic character of paranoia and many paranoid
forms is still in great uncertainty. This being so it is worth while
to inquire whether manifestations of degeneration could not also be
provoked by psychological disturbance of function. Such an idea is only
incomprehensible to those who smuggle materialistic preconceptions into
their scientific theories. This question does not even rest upon some
fundamental and arbitrary spiritualism, but upon the following simple
reflection. Instead of assuming that some hereditary disposition, or a
toxæmia, gives rise directly to organic processes of disease, I incline
to the view that upon the basis of predisposition, whose nature is
at present unknown to us, there arises a non-adaptable psychological
function which can proceed to develop into manifest mental disorder;
this may secondarily determine organic degeneration with its own train
of symptoms. In favour of this conception is the fact that we have no
proof of the primary nature of the organic disorder, but overwhelming
proofs exist of a primary psychological fault in function, whose history
can be traced back to the patient's childhood. In perfect agreement
with this conception is the fact that analytic practice has given us
experience of cases where patients on the borderline of dementia præcox
have been brought back to normal life.

Even if anatomical lesions or organic symptoms were constantly present,
science ought not to imagine the psychological standpoint could
advisedly be neglected, or the undoubted psychological relationship
be given up as unimportant. If, for instance, carcinoma were to prove
an infectious disease the peculiar growth and degenerative process
of carcinomatous cells would still be a constant factor requiring
investigation on its own account. But, as I have said, the correlation
between the anatomical findings and the psychological picture of
the disease is so loose that it is extremely desirable to study the
psychological side of it thoroughly.
