# CHAPTER I

## ON THE PSYCHOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY OF SO-CALLED OCCULT PHENOMENA[1]


In that wide field of psychopathic deficiency where Science has
demarcated the diseases of epilepsy, hysteria and neurasthenia, we meet
scattered observations concerning certain rare states of consciousness
as to whose meaning authors are not yet agreed. These observations
spring up sporadically in the literature on narcolepsy, lethargy,
_automatisme ambulatoire_, periodic amnesia, double consciousness,
somnambulism, pathological dreamy states, pathological lying, etc.

These states are sometimes attributed to epilepsy, sometimes
to hysteria, sometimes to exhaustion of the nervous system, or
neurasthenia, sometimes they are allowed all the dignity of a disease
_sui generis_. Patients occasionally work through a whole graduated
scale of diagnoses, from epilepsy, through hysteria, up to simulation.
In practice, on the one hand, these conditions can only be separated
with great difficulty from the so-called neuroses, sometimes even are
indistinguishable from them; on the other, certain features in the
region of pathological deficiency present more than a mere analogical
relationship not only with phenomena of normal psychology, but also
with the psychology of the supernormal, of genius. Various as are the
individual phenomena in this region, there is certainly no case that
cannot be connected by some intermediate example with the other typical
cases. This relationship in the pictures presented by hysteria and
epilepsy is very close. Recently the view has even been maintained that
there is no clean-cut frontier between epilepsy and hysteria, and that
a difference is only to be noted in extreme cases. Steffens says, for
example[2]--"We are forced to the conclusion that in essence hysteria
and epilepsy are not fundamentally different, that the cause of the
disease is the same, but is manifest in a diverse form, in different
intensity and permanence."

The demarcation of hysteria and certain borderline cases of epilepsy
from congenital and acquired psychopathic mental deficiency likewise
presents the greatest difficulties. The symptoms of one or other disease
everywhere invade the neighbouring realm, so violence is done to the
facts when they are split off and considered as belonging to one or
other realm. The demarcation of psychopathic mental deficiency from the
normal is an absolutely impossible task, the difference is everywhere
only "more or less." The classification in the region of mental
deficiency itself is confronted by the same difficulty. At best, certain
classes can be separated off which crystallise round some well-marked
nucleus through having peculiarly typical features. Turning away from
the two large groups of intellectual and emotional deficiency, there
remain those deficiencies coloured pre-eminently by hysteria or epilepsy
(epileptoid) or neurasthenia, which are not notably deficiency of the
intellect or of feeling. It is essentially in this region, insusceptible
of any absolute classification, that the above-named conditions play
their part. As is well known, they can appear as part manifestations
of a typical epilepsy or hysteria, or can exist separately in the
realm of psychopathic mental deficiency, where their qualifications of
epileptic or hysterical are often due to the non-essential accessory
features. It is thus the rule to place somnambulism among hysterical
diseases, because it is occasionally a phenomenon of severe hysteria,
or because mild so-called hysterical symptoms may accompany it. Binet
says: "Il n'y a pas une somnambulisme, état nerveux toujours identique
à lui-même, il y a des somnambulismes." As one of the manifestations
of a severe hysteria, somnambulism is not an unknown phenomenon, but
as a pathological entity, as a disease _sui generis_, it must be
somewhat rare, to judge by its infrequency in German literature on the
subject. So-called spontaneous somnambulism, resting upon a foundation
of hysterically-tinged psychopathic deficiency, is not a very common
occurrence and it is worth while to devote closer study to these cases,
for they occasionally present a mass of interesting particulars.

_Case of Miss Elise K._, aged 40, single; book-keeper in a large
business; no hereditary taint, except that it is alleged a brother
became slightly nervous after family misfortune and illness. Well
educated, of a cheerful, joyous nature, not of a saving disposition,
always occupied with some big idea. She was very kind-hearted and
gentle, did a great deal both for her parents, who were living in very
modest circumstances, and for strangers. Nevertheless she was not happy,
because she thought she did not understand herself. She had always
enjoyed good health till a few years ago, when she is said to have
been treated for dilatation of the stomach and tapeworm. During this
illness her hair became rapidly white, later she had typhoid fever. An
engagement was terminated by the death of her fiancé from paralysis. She
had been very nervous for a year and a half. In the summer of 1897 she
went away for change of air and treatment by hydropathy. She herself
says that for about a year she has had moments during work when her
thoughts seem to stand still, but she does not fall asleep. Nevertheless
she makes no mistakes in the accounts at such times. She has often been
to the wrong street and then suddenly noticed that she was not in the
right place. She has had no giddiness or attacks of fainting. Formerly
menstruation occurred regularly every four weeks, and without any
pain, but since she has been nervous and overworked it has come every
fourteen days. For a long time she has suffered from constant headache.
As accountant and book-keeper in a large establishment, the patient has
had very strenuous work, which she performs well and conscientiously. In
addition to the strenuous character of her work, in the last year she
had various new worries. Her brother was suddenly divorced. In addition
to her own work, she looked after his housekeeping, nursed him and his
child in a serious illness, and so on. To recuperate, she took a journey
on the 13th September to see a woman friend in South Germany. The great
joy at seeing her friend from whom she had been long separated, and
her participation in some festivities, deprived her of her rest. On
the 15th, she and her friend drank half a bottle of claret. This was
contrary to her usual habit. They then went for a walk in a cemetery,
where she began to tear up flowers and to scratch at the graves. She
remembered absolutely nothing of this afterwards. On the 16th she
remained with her friend without anything of importance happening. On
the 17th her friend brought her to Zürich. An acquaintance came with her
to the Asylum; on the way she spoke quite sensibly, but was very tired.
Outside the Asylum they met three boys, whom she described as the "three
dead people she had dug up." She then wanted to go to the neighbouring
cemetery, but was persuaded to come to the Asylum.

She is small, delicately formed, slightly anæmic. The heart is slightly
enlarged to the left, there are no murmurs, but some reduplication of
the sounds, the mitral being markedly accentuated. The liver dulness
reaches to the border of the ribs. Patella-reflex is somewhat increased,
but otherwise no tendon-reflexes. There is neither anæsthesia,
analgesia, nor paralysis. Rough examination of the field of vision with
the hands shows no contraction. The patient's hair is a very light
yellow-white colour; on the whole she looks her age. She gives her
history and tells recent events quite clearly, but has no recollection
of what took place in the cemetery at C. or outside the Asylum. During
the night of the 17th-18th she spoke to the attendant and declared she
saw the whole room full of dead people--looking like skeletons. She was
not at all frightened, but was rather surprised that the attendant did
not see them too. Once she ran to the window, but was otherwise quiet.
The next morning, while still in bed, she saw skeletons, but not in
the afternoon. The following night at four o'clock she awoke and heard
the dead children in the neighbouring cemetery cry out that they had
been buried alive. She wanted to go out to dig them up, but allowed
herself to be restrained. Next morning at seven o'clock she was still
delirious, but recalled accurately the events in the cemetery at C. and
those on approaching the Asylum. She stated that at C. she wanted to
dig up the dead children who were calling her. She had only torn up the
flowers to free the graves and to be able to get at them. In this state
Professor Bleuler explained to her that later on, when in a normal state
again, she would remember everything. The patient slept in the morning,
afterwards was quite clear, and felt herself relatively well. She did
indeed remember the attacks, but maintained a remarkable indifference
towards them. The following nights, with the exception of those of the
22nd and the 25th September, she again had slight attacks of delirium,
when once more she had to deal with the dead. The details of the attacks
differed, however. Twice she saw the dead in her bed, but she did not
appear to be afraid of them, she got out of bed frequently, however,
because she did not want "to inconvenience the dead"; several times she
wanted to leave the room.

After a few nights free from attacks there was a slight one on the
30th Sept., when she called the dead from the window. During the day
her mind was clear. On the 3rd of October she saw a whole crowd of
skeletons in the drawingroom, as she afterwards related, during full
consciousness. Although she doubted the reality of the skeletons, she
could not convince herself that it was a hallucination. The following
night, between twelve and one o'clock--the earlier attacks were usually
about this time--she was obsessed with the idea of dead people for
about ten minutes. She sat up in bed, stared at a corner and said:
"Well, come!--but they're not all there. Come along! Why don't you
come? The room is big enough, there's room for all; when all are there,
I'll come too." Then she lay down with the words: "Now they're all
there," and fell asleep again. In the morning she had not the slightest
recollection of any of these attacks. Very short attacks occurred in
the nights of the 4th, 6th, 9th, 13th and 15th of October, between
twelve and one o'clock. The last three occurred during the menstrual
period. The attendant spoke to her several times, showed her the lighted
street-lamps, and trees; but she did not react to this conversation.
Since then the attacks have altogether ceased. The patient has
complained about a number of troubles which she had had all along. She
suffered much from headache the morning after the attacks. She said it
was unbearable. Five grains of Sacch. lactis promptly alleviated this;
then she complained of pains in both fore-arms, which she described as
if it were a teno-synovitis. She regarded the bulging of the muscles in
flexion as a swelling, and asked to be massaged. Nothing could be seen
objectively, and no attention being paid to it, the trouble disappeared.
She complained exceedingly and for a long time about the thickening of
a toenail, even after the thickened part had been removed. Sleep was
often disturbed. She would not give her consent to be hypnotised for
the night-attacks. Finally on account of headache and disturbed sleep
she agreed to hypnotic treatment. She proved a good subject, and at the
first sitting fell into deep sleep with analgesia and amnesia.

In November she was again asked whether she could now remember the
attack on the 19th September which it had been suggested that she would
recall. It gave her great trouble to recollect it, and in the end she
could only state the chief facts, she had forgotten the details.

It should be added that the patient was not superstitious, and in
her healthy days had never particularly interested herself in the
supernatural. During the whole course of treatment, which ended on the
14th November, great indifference was evinced both to the illness and
the cure. Next spring the patient returned for out-patient treatment
of the headache, which had come back during the very hard work of
these months. Apart from this symptom her condition left nothing to
be desired. It was demonstrated that she had no remembrance of the
attacks of the previous autumn, not even of those of the 19th September
and earlier. On the other hand, in hypnosis she could recount the
proceedings in the cemetery and during the nightly disturbances.

By the peculiar hallucination and by its appearance our case recalls
the conditions which V. Kraft-Ebing has described as "protracted states
of hysterical delirium." He says: "Such conditions of delirium occur
in the slighter cases of hysteria. Protracted hysterical delirium is
built upon a foundation of temporary exhaustion. Excitement seems to
determine an outbreak, and it readily recurs. Most frequently there
is persecution-delirium with very violent anxiety, sometimes of a
religious or erotic character. Hallucinations of all the senses are
not rare, but illusions of sight, smell and feeling are the commonest,
and most important. The visual hallucinations are especially visions
of animals, pictures of corpses, phantastic processions in which dead
persons, devils and ghosts swarm. The illusions of hearing are simply
sounds (shrieks, howlings, claps of thunder) or local hallucinations,
frequently with a sexual content."

This patient's visions of corpses, occurring almost always in attacks,
recall the states occasionally seen in hystero-epilepsy. There likewise
occur specific visions which, in contrast with protracted delirium, are
connected with single attacks.

(1) A lady 30 years of age with _grande hystérie_ had twilight states in
which as a rule she was troubled by terrible hallucinations; she saw her
children carried away from her, wild beasts eating them up, and so on.
She has amnesia for the content of the individual attacks.[3]

(2) A girl of 17, likewise a semi-hysteric, saw in her attacks the
corpse of her dead mother approaching her to draw her to her. Patient
has amnesia for the attacks.[4]

These are cases of severe hysteria wherein consciousness rests upon a
profound stage of dreaming. The nature of the attack and the stability
of the hallucination alone show a certain kinship with our case, which
in this respect has numerous analogies with the corresponding states of
hysteria. For instance, with those cases where a psychical shock (rape,
etc.) was the occasion for the outbreak of hysterical attacks, and where
at times the original incident is lived over again, stereotyped in the
hallucination. But our case gets its specific mould from the identity of
the consciousness in the different attacks. It is an "Etat Second" with
its own memory and separated from the waking state by complete amnesia.
This differentiates it from the above-mentioned twilight states and
links it to the so-called somnambulic conditions.

Charcot[5] divides the somnambulic states into two chief classes:--

1. Delirium with well-marked incoordination of representation and action.

2. Delirium with co-ordinated action. This approaches the waking state.

Our case belongs to the latter class.

If by somnambulism be understood a state of systematised partial
waking,[6] any critical review of this affection must take account of
those exceptional cases of recurrent amnesias which have been observed
now and again. These, apart from nocturnal ambulism, are the simplest
conditions of systematised partial waking. Naef's case is certainly the
most remarkable in the literature. It deals with a gentleman of 32, with
a very bad family history presenting numerous signs of degeneration,
partly functional, partly organic. In consequence of over-work at the
age of 17 he had a peculiar twilight state with delusions, which lasted
some days and was cured with a sudden recovery of memory. Later he
was subject to frequent attacks of giddiness and palpitation of the
heart and vomiting; but these attacks were never attended by loss of
consciousness. At the termination of some feverish illness he suddenly
travelled from Australia to Zürich, where he lived for some weeks in
careless cheerfulness, and only came to himself when he read in the
paper of his sudden disappearance from Australia. He had a total and
retrograde amnesia for the several months which included the journey to
Australia, his sojourn there and the return journey.

Azam[7] has published a case of periodic amnesia. Albert X., 12 1/2
years old, of hysterical disposition, was several times attacked in
the course of a few years by conditions of amnesia in which he forgot
reading, writing and arithmetic, even at times his own language, for
several weeks at a stretch. The intervals were normal.

Proust[8] has published a case of _Automatisme ambulatoire_ with
pronounced hysteria which differs from Naef's in the repeated occurrence
of the attacks. An educated man, 30 years old, exhibits all the signs
of _grande hystérie;_ he is very suggestible, has from time to time,
under the influence of excitement, attacks of amnesia which last from
two days to several weeks. During these states he wanders about, visits
relatives, destroys various objects, incurs debts, and has even been
convicted of "picking pockets."

Boileau describes a similar case[9] of wandering-impulse. A widow of
22, highly hysterical, became terrified at the prospect of a necessary
operation for salpingitis; she left the hospital and fell into a state
of somnambulism, from which she awoke three days later with total
amnesia. During these three days she had travelled a distance of about
60 kilometres to fetch her child.

William James has described a case of an "ambulatory sort."[10]

The Rev. Ansel Bourne, an itinerant preacher, 30 years of age,
psychopathic, had on a few occasions attacks of loss of consciousness
lasting one hour. One day (January 17, 1887) he suddenly disappeared
from Greene, after having taken 551 dollars out of the bank. He
remained hidden for two months. During this time he had taken a little
shop under the name of H. J. Browne in Norriston, Pa., and had carefully
attended to all purchases, although he had never done this sort of work
before. On March 14, 1887, he suddenly awoke and went back home, and had
complete amnesia for the interval.

Mesnet[11] publishes the following case:--

F., 27 years old, sergeant in the African regiment, was wounded in
the parietal bone at Bazeilles. Suffered for a year from hemiplegia,
which disappeared when the wound healed. During the course of his
illness the patient had attacks of somnambulism, with marked limitation
of consciousness; all the senses were paralysed, with the exception
of taste and a small portion of the visual sense. The movements
were co-ordinated, but obstacles in the way of their performance
were overcome with difficulty. During the attacks he had an absurd
collecting-mania. By various manipulations one could demonstrate a
hallucinatory content in his consciousness; for instance, when a stick
was put in his hand he would feel himself transported to a battle scene,
would place himself on guard, see the enemy approaching, etc.

Guinon and Sophie Waltke[12] made the following experiments on
hysterics:--

A blue glass was held in front of the eyes of a female patient during
a hysterical attack; she regularly saw the picture of her mother in
the blue sky. A red glass showed her a bleeding wound, a yellow one an
orange-seller or a lady with a yellow dress.

Mesnet's case reminds one of the cases of occasional attacks of
shrinkage of memory.

MacNish[13] communicates a similar case.

An apparently healthy young lady suddenly fell into an abnormally long
and deep sleep--it is said without prodromal symptoms. On awaking she
had forgotten the words for and the knowledge of the simplest things.
She had again to learn to read, write, and count; her progress was rapid
in this re-learning. After a second attack she again woke in her normal
state, but without recollection of the period when she had forgotten
things. These states alternated for more than four years, during which
consciousness showed continuity within the two states, but was separated
by an amnesia from the consciousness of the normal state.

These selected cases of various forms of changes of consciousness
all throw a certain light upon our case. Naef's case presents two
hysteriform eclipses of memory, one of which is marked by the appearance
of delusions, and the other by its long duration, contraction of the
field of consciousness, and desire to wander. The peculiar associated
impulses are specially clear in the cases of Proust and Mesnet. In our
case the impulsive tearing up of the flowers, the digging up of the
graves, form a parallel. The continuity of consciousness which the
patient presents in the individual attacks recalls the behaviour of
the consciousness in MacNish's case; hence our case may be regarded
as a transient phenomenon of alternating consciousness. The dreamlike
hallucinatory content of the limited consciousness in our case does not,
however, justify an unqualified assignment to this group of _double
consciousness_. The hallucinations in the second state show a certain
creativeness which seems to be conditioned by the auto-suggestibility
of this state. In Mesnet's case we noticed the appearance of
hallucinatory processes from simple stimulation of touch. The patient's
subconsciousness employs simple perceptions for the automatic
construction of complicated scenes which then take possession of the
limited consciousness. A somewhat similar view must be taken about
our patient's hallucinations; at least, the external conditions which
gave rise to the appearance of the hallucinations seem to strengthen
our supposition. The walk in the cemetery induces the vision of the
skeletons; the meeting with the three boys arouses the hallucination of
children buried alive whose voices the patient hears at night-time. She
arrived at the cemetery in a somnambulic state, which on this occasion
was specially intense in consequence of her having taken alcohol. She
performed actions almost instinctively about which her subconsciousness
nevertheless did receive certain impressions. (The part played here by
alcohol must not be underestimated. We know from experience that it does
not only act adversely upon these conditions, but, like every other
narcotic, it gives rise to a certain increase of suggestibility.) The
impressions received in somnambulism subconsciously form independent
growths, and finally reach perception as hallucinations. Thus our
case closely corresponds to those somnambulic dream-states which have
recently been subjected to a penetrating study in England and France.

These lapses of memory, which at first seem without content, gain a
content by means of accidental auto-suggestion, and this content builds
itself up automatically to a certain extent. It achieves no further
development, probably on account of the improvement now beginning,
and finally it disappears altogether as recovery sets in. Binet and
Féré have made numerous experiments on the implanting of suggestions
in states of partial sleep. They have shown, for example, that when a
pencil is put in the anæsthetic hand of a hysteric, letters of great
length are written automatically whose contents are unknown to the
patient's consciousness. Cutaneous stimuli in anæsthetic regions are
sometimes perceived as visual images, or at least as vivid associated
visual presentations. These independent transmutations of simple stimuli
must be regarded as primary phenomena in the formation of somnambulic
dream-pictures. Analogous manifestations occur in exceptional cases
within the sphere of waking consciousness. Goethe,[14] for instance,
states that when he sat down, lowered his head and vividly conjured up
the image of a flower, he saw it undergoing changes of its own accord,
as if entering into new combinations.

In half-waking states these manifestations are relatively frequent
in the so-called hypnagogic hallucinations. The automatisms which
the Goethe example illustrates are differentiated from the truly
somnambulic, inasmuch as the primary presentation is a conscious one
in this case; the further development of the automatism is maintained
within the definite limits of the original presentation, that is, within
the purely motor or visual region.

If the primary presentation disappears, or if it is never conscious at
all, and if the automatic development overlaps neighbouring regions,
we lose every possibility of a demarcation between waking automatisms
and those of the somnambulic state; this will occur, for instance,
if the presentation of a hand plucking the flower gets joined to the
perception of the flower or the presentation of the smell of the flower.
We can then only differentiate it by the more or less. In one case
we then speak of the "waking hallucinations of the normal," in the
other, of the dream-vision of the somnambulists. The interpretation
of our patient's attacks as hysterical becomes more certain by the
demonstration of a probably psychogenic origin of the hallucination.
This is confirmed by her troubles, headache and teno-synovitis, which
have shown themselves amenable to suggestive treatment. The ætiological
factor alone is not sufficient for the diagnosis of hysteria; it might
really be expected _a priori_ that in the course of a disease which is
so suitably treated by rest, as in the treatment of an exhaustion-state,
features would be observed here and there which could be interpreted
as manifestations of exhaustion. The question arises whether the
early lapses and later somnambulic attacks could not be conceived as
states of exhaustion, so-called "neurasthenic crises." We know that in
the realm of psychopathic mental deficiency there can arise the most
diverse epileptoid accidents, whose classification under epilepsy or
hysteria is at least doubtful. To quote C. Westphal: "On the basis of
numerous observations, I maintain that the so-called epileptoid attacks
form one of the most universal and commonest symptoms in the group of
diseases which we reckon among the mental diseases and neuropathies; the
mere appearance of one or more epileptic or epileptoid attacks is not
decisive for its course and prognosis. As mentioned, I have used the
concept of epileptoid in the widest sense for the attack itself."[15]

The epileptoid moments of our case are not far to seek; the objection
can, however, be raised that the colouring of the whole picture is
hysterical in the extreme. Against this, however, it must be stated
that every somnambulism is not _eo ipso_ hysterical. Occasionally
states occur in typical epilepsy which to experts seem parallel with
somnambulic states,[16] or which can only be distinguished by the
existence of genuine convulsions.[17]

As Diehl shows,[18] in neurasthenic mental deficiency crises also occur
which often confuse the diagnosis. A definite presentation-content
can even create a stereotyped repetition in the individual crisis.
Lately Mörchen has published a case of epileptoid neurasthenic twilight
state.[19]

I am indebted to Professor Bleuler for the report of the following
case:--

An educated gentleman of middle age--without epileptic antecedents--had
exhausted himself by many years of over-strenuous mental work. Without
other prodromal symptoms (such as depression, etc.) he attempted suicide
during a holiday; in a peculiar twilight state he suddenly threw himself
into the water from a bank, in sight of many persons. He was at once
pulled out and retained but a fleeting remembrance of the occurrence.

Bearing these observations in mind, neurasthenia must be allowed to
account for a considerable share in the attacks of our patient, Miss
E. K. The headaches and the teno-synovitis point to the existence of
a relatively mild hysteria, generally latent, but becoming manifest
under the influence of exhaustion. The genesis of this peculiar illness
explains the relationship which has been described between epilepsy,
hysteria and neurasthenia.

_Summary._--Miss Elise K. is a psychopathic defective with a tendency
to hysteria. Under the influence of nervous exhaustion she suffers from
attacks of epileptoid giddiness whose interpretation is uncertain at
first sight. Under the influence of an unusually large dose of alcohol
the attacks develop into definite somnambulism with hallucinations,
which are limited in the same way as dreams to accidental external
perceptions. When the nervous exhaustion is cured the hysterical
manifestations disappear.

In the region of psychopathic deficiency with hysterical colouring, we
encounter numerous phenomena which show, as in this case, symptoms of
diverse defined diseases, which cannot be attributed with certainty
to any one of them. These phenomena are partially recognised to be
independent; for instance, pathological lying, pathological reveries,
etc. Many of these states, however, still await thorough scientific
investigation; at present they belong more or less to the domain of
scientific gossip. Persons with habitual hallucinations, and also the
inspired, exhibit these states; they draw the attention of the crowd to
themselves, now as poet or artist, now as saviour, prophet or founder of
a new sect.

The genesis of the peculiar frame of mind of these persons is for the
most part lost in obscurity, for it is only very rarely that one of
these remarkable personalities can be subjected to exact observation.
In view of the often great historical importance of these persons, it
is much to be wished that we had some scientific material which would
enable us to gain a closer insight into the psychological development of
their peculiarities. Apart from the now practically useless productions
of the pneumatological school at the beginning of the nineteenth
century, German scientific literature is very poor in this respect;
indeed, there seems to be real aversion from investigation in this
field. For the facts so far gathered we are indebted almost exclusively
to the labours of French and English workers. It seems at least
desirable that our literature should be enlarged in this respect. These
considerations have induced me to publish some observations which will
perhaps help to further our knowledge concerning the relationship of
hysterical twilight-states and enlarge the problems of normal psychology.
