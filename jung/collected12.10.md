_From Dr. Jung._

    March, 1913.

At various places in your letters it has struck me that the problem
of "transference" seems to you particularly critical. Your feeling is
entirely justified. The transference is indeed at present the central
problem of analysis.

You know that Freud regards the transference as the projection of
infantile phantasies upon the doctor. To this extent the transference
is an infantile-erotic relationship. All the same, viewed from the
outside, superficially, the thing by no means always looks like an
infantile-erotic situation. As long as it is a question of the so-called
"positive" transference, the infantile-erotic character can usually be
recognised without difficulty. But if it is a "negative" transference,
you can see nothing but violent resistances which sometimes veil
themselves in seemingly critical or sceptical dress. In a certain
sense the determining factor in such circumstances is the patient's
relation to authority, that is, in the last resort, to the father. In
both forms of transference the doctor is treated as if he were the
father--according to the situation either tenderly or with hostility.
In this view the transference has the force of a resistance as soon as
it becomes a question of resolving the infantile attitude. But this
form of transference must be destroyed, inasmuch as the object of
analysis is the patient's moral autonomy. A lofty aim, you will say.
Indeed lofty, and far off, but still not altogether so remote, since it
actually corresponds to one of the predominating tendencies of our stage
of civilisation, namely, that urge towards individualisation by which
our whole epoch deserves to be characterised. (Cf. Müller-Lyer: "Die
Familie.") If a man does not believe in this orientation and still bows
before the scientific causal view-point, he will, of course, be disposed
merely to resolve this hostility, and to let the patient remain in a
positive relationship towards the father, _thus expressing the ideal of
an earlier epoch of civilisation_. It is commonly recognised that the
Catholic Church represents one of the most powerful organisations based
upon this earlier tendency. I cannot venture to doubt that there are
very many individuals who feel happier under compulsion from others than
when forced to discipline themselves. (Cf. Shaw: "Man and Superman.")
None the less, we do our neurotic patients a grievous wrong if we try
to force them all into the category of the unfree. Among neurotics,
there are not a few who do not require any reminders of their social
duties and obligations; rather are they born or destined to become the
bearers of new social ideals. They are neurotic so long as they bow down
to authority and refuse the freedom to which they are destined. Whilst
we look at life only retrospectively, as is the case in the Viennese
psychoanalytic writings, we shall never do justice to this type of case
and never bring the longed-for deliverance. For in that fashion we can
only educate them to become obedient children, and thereby strengthen
the very forces that have made them ill--their conservative retardation
and their submissiveness to authority. Up to a certain point this
is the right way to take with the infantile resistance which cannot
_yet_ reconcile itself with authority. But the power which edged them
out from their retrograde dependence on the father is not at all a
childish desire for insubordination, but the powerful urge towards the
development of an individual personality, and this struggle is their
imperative life's task. Adler's psychology does much greater justice to
this situation than Freud's.

In the one case (that of infantile intractability) the positive
transference signifies a highly important achievement, heralding cure;
in the other (infantile submissiveness) it portends a dangerous
backsliding, a convenient evasion of life's duty. The negative
transference represents in the first case an increased resistance, thus
a backsliding and an evasion of duty, but in the second it is an advance
of healing significance. (For the two types, cf. Adler's "Trotz und
Gehorsam.")

The transference then is, as you see, to be judged quite differently in
different cases.

The psychological process of "transference"--be it negative or
positive--consists in the libido _entrenching itself_, as it were, round
the personality of the doctor, the doctor accordingly representing
certain emotional values. (As you know, by _libido_ I understand very
much what Antiquity meant by the cosmogenic principle of _Eros_; in
modern terminology simply "psychic energy.") The patient is bound to
the doctor, be it in affection, be it in opposition, and cannot fail to
follow and imitate the doctor's psychic adaptations. To this he finds
himself urgently compelled. And with the best will in the world and all
technical skill, the doctor cannot prevent him, for intuition works
surely and instinctively, in despite of the conscious judgment, be it
never so strong. Were the doctor himself neurotic, and inadequate in
response to the demands of the external life, or inharmonious within,
the patient would copy the defect and build it up into the fabric of his
own presentations: you may imagine the result.

Accordingly I cannot regard the transference as merely the transference
of infantile-erotic phantasies; no doubt that is what it is from one
standpoint, but I see also in it, as I said in an earlier letter,
the process of the _growth of feeling_ and _adaptation_. From this
standpoint the infantile erotic phantasies, in spite of their
indisputable reality, appear rather as material for comparison or
as analogous pictures of something not understood as yet, than as
independent desires. This seems to me the real reason of their being
unconscious. The patient, not knowing the right attitude, tries to
grasp at a right relationship to the doctor by way of comparison and
analogy with his infantile experiences. It is not surprising that he
gropes back for just the most intimate relations of his childhood, to
discover the appropriate formula for his attitude to the doctor, for
this relationship also is very intimate, and to some extent different
from the sexual relationship, just as is that of the child towards its
parents. This relationship--child to parent--which Christianity has
everywhere set up as the symbolic formula for human relationships,
provides a way of restoring to the patient that directness of ordinary
human emotion of which he had been deprived through the inroad of
sexual and social values (from the standpoint of power, etc.). The
purely sexual, more or less primitive and barbaric valuation, operates
in far-reaching ways against a direct, simple human relationship, and
thereupon a blocking of the libido occurs which easily gives rise to
neurotic formations. By means of analysis of the infantile portion
of the transference-phantasies, the patient is brought back to the
remembrance of his childhood's relationship, and this--stripped of
its infantile qualities--gives him a beautiful, clear picture of
direct human intercourse as opposed to the purely sexual valuation. I
cannot regard it as other than a misconception to judge the childish
relationship retrospectively and therefore as exclusively a sexual one,
even though a certain sexual content can in no wise be denied to it.

Recapitulating, let me say this much of the positive transference:--

The patient's libido fastens upon the person of the doctor, taking the
shape of expectation, hope, interest, trust, friendship and love. Then
the transference produces the projection upon the doctor of infantile
phantasies, often of predominatingly erotic tinge. At this stage the
transference is usually of a decidedly sexual character, in spite of
the sexual component remaining relatively unconscious. But this phase
of feeling serves the higher aspect of the growth of human feeling as a
bridge, whereby the patient becomes conscious of the defectiveness of
his own adaptation, through his recognition of the doctor's attitude,
which is accepted as one suitable to life's demands, and normal in its
human relationships. By help of the analysis, and the recalling of his
childish relationships, the road is seen which leads right out of those
exclusively sexual or "power" evaluations of social surroundings which
were acquired in puberty and strongly reinforced by social prejudices.
This road leads on towards a purely human relation and intimacy, not
derived solely from the existence of a sexual or power-relation, but
depending much more upon a regard for personality. That is the road to
freedom which the doctor must show his patient.

Here indeed I must not omit to say that the obstinate clinging to the
sexual valuation would not be maintained so tenaciously if it had
not also a very deep significance for that period of life in which
propagation is of primary importance. The discovery of the value of
human personality belongs to a riper age. For young people the search
for the valuable personality is very often merely a cloak for the
evasion of their biological duty. On the other hand, an older person's
exaggerated looking back towards the sexual valuation of youth, is an
undiscerning and often cowardly and convenient retreat from a duty which
demands the recognition of personal values and his own enrolment among
the ranks of the priesthood of a newer civilisation. The young neurotic
shrinks back in terror from the extension of his tasks in life, the old
from the dwindling and shrinking of the treasures he has attained.

This conception of the transference is, you will have noted, most
intimately connected with the acceptance of the idea of biological
"_duties_." By this term you must understand those tendencies or
motives in human beings giving rise to civilisation, as inevitably
as in the bird they give rise to the exquisitely woven nest, and in
the stag to the production of antlers. The purely causal, not to say
materialistic conception of the immediately preceding decades, would
conceive the organic formation as the reaction of living matter, and
this doubtless provides a position heuristically useful, but, as far
as any real understanding goes, leads only to a more or less ingenious
and _apparent_ reduction and postponement of the problem. Let me refer
you to Bergson's excellent criticism of this conception. From external
forces but half the result, at most, could ensue; the other half lies
within the individual disposition of the living material, without which
it is obvious the specific reaction-formation could never be achieved.
This principle must be applied also in psychology. The psyche does not
only _react_; it also gives its own individual reply to the influences
at work upon it, and at least half the resulting configuration and its
existing disposition is due to this. Civilisation is never, and again
never, to be regarded as merely reaction to environment. That shallow
explanation we may abandon peacefully to the past century. It is just
these very dispositions which we must regard as imperative in the
psychological sphere; it is easy to get convincing proof daily of their
compulsive power. What I call "biological duty" is identical with these
dispositions.

In conclusion, I must deal with a matter which seems to have caused you
uneasiness, namely, the _moral_ question. Among our patients we see
many so-called immoral tendencies, therefore the thought involuntarily
forces itself upon the psychotherapist as to how things would go if all
these desires were to be gratified. You will have discerned already
from my earlier letters that these desires must not be estimated too
literally. As a rule it is rather a matter of unmeasured and exaggerated
demands, arising out of the patient's stored-up libido, which have
usurped a prominent position, usually quite against his own wish. In
most cases the canalisation of the libido for the fulfilment of life's
simple duties, suffices to reduce these exaggerated desires to zero.
But in some cases it must be recognised that such "immoral" tendencies
are in no way removed by analysis; on the contrary, they appear more
often and more clearly, hence it becomes plain that they belong to the
individual's biological duties. And this is particularly true of certain
sexual claims, whose aim is an individual valuation of sexuality. This
is not a question for pathology, it is a social question of to-day which
peremptorily demands an ethical solution. For many it is a biological
duty to work for the solution of this question, to discover some sort
of practical solution. (Nature, it is well known, does not content
herself with theories.) To-day we have no real sexual morality, only a
legal attitude towards sexuality; just as the early Middle Ages had no
genuine morality for financial transactions, but only prejudices and a
legal standpoint. We are not yet sufficiently advanced in the domain
of free sexual activity to distinguish between a moral and an immoral
relationship. We have a clear expression of this in the customary
treatment, or rather ill-treatment, of unmarried motherhood. For a great
deal of sickening hypocrisy, for the high tide of prostitution, and for
the prevalence of sexual diseases, we may thank both our barbarous,
undifferentiated legal judgments about the sexual situation, and our
inability to develop a finer moral perception of the immense psychologic
differences that may exist in free sexual activity.

This reference to the existence of an exceedingly complicated and
significant problem may suffice to explain why we by no means seldom
meet with individuals among our patients who are quite specially called,
because of their spiritual and social gifts, to take an active part in
the work of civilisation--for this they are biologically destined. We
must never forget that what to-day is deemed a moral law will to-morrow
be cast into the melting-pot and transformed, so that in the near or
distant future it may serve as the basis of a new ethical structure.
This much we ought to have learnt from the history of civilisation, that
the forms of morality belong to the category of transitory things. The
finest psychological tact is required with these critical natures, so
that the dangerous corners of infantile irresponsibility, indolence and
uncontrolledness may be turned, and a pure, untroubled vision of the
possibility of a moral autonomous activity made possible. Five per cent.
on money lent is fair interest, twenty per cent. is despicable usury.
That point of view we have to apply equally to the sexual situation.

So it comes about that there are many neurotics whose innermost delicacy
of feeling prevents their being at one with present-day morality, and
they cannot adapt themselves to civilisation as long as their moral
code has gaps in it, the filling up of which is a crying need of the
age. We deceive ourselves greatly if we suppose that many married women
are neurotic only because they are unsatisfied sexually or because they
have not found the right man, or because they still have a fixation to
their infantile sexuality. The real ground of the neurosis is, in many
cases, the inability to recognise the work that is waiting for them, of
helping to build up a new civilisation. We are all far too much at the
standpoint of the "nothing-but" psychology; we persist in thinking we
can squeeze the new future which is pressing in at the door into the
framework of the old and the known. And thus the view is only of the
present, never of the future. But it was of most profound psychological
significance when Christianity first discovered, in the orientation
towards the future, a redeeming principle for mankind. In the past
nothing can be altered, and in the present little, but the future is
ours and capable of raising life's intensity to its highest pitch. A
little space of youth belongs to us, all the rest of life belongs to our
children.

Thus does your question as to the significance of the loss of faith in
authority answer itself. The neurotic is ill not because he has lost his
old faith, but because he has not yet found a new form for his finest
aspirations.
