## CASE OF SOMNAMBULISM IN A PERSON WITH NEUROPATHIC INHERITANCE
(SPIRITUALISTIC MEDIUM).

The following case was under my observation in the years 1899 and
1900. As I was not in medical attendance upon Miss S. W., a physical
examination for hysterical stigmata unfortunately could not be made.
I kept a complete diary of the séances, which I filled up after each
sitting. The following report is a condensed account from these notes.
Out of regard for Miss S. W. and her family a few unimportant dates have
been altered and a few details omitted from the story, which for the
most part is composed of very intimate matters.

Miss S. W., 15 1/2 years old. Reformed Church. The paternal grandfather
was highly intelligent, a clergyman with frequent waking hallucinations
(generally visions, often whole dramatic scenes with dialogues, etc.).
A brother of the grandfather was an imbecile eccentric, who also saw
visions. A sister of the grandfather, a peculiar, odd character. The
paternal grandmother after some fever in her 20th year (typhoid?) had
a trance which lasted three days, from which she did not awake until
the crown of her head had been burned by a red-hot iron. During states
of excitement later on she had fainting fits which were nearly always
followed by a brief somnambulism during which she uttered prophesies.
Her father was likewise a peculiar, original personality with bizarre
ideas. All three had waking hallucinations (second-sight, forebodings,
etc.). A third brother was also eccentric and odd, talented but
one-sided. The mother has an inherited mental defect often bordering
on psychosis. The sister is a hysteric and visionary and a second
sister suffers from "nervous heart attacks." Miss S. W. is slenderly
built, skull somewhat rachitic, without pronounced hydrocephalus, face
rather pale, eyes dark with a peculiar penetrating look. She has had
no serious illnesses. At school she passed for average, showed little
interest, was inattentive. As a rule her behaviour was rather reserved,
sometimes giving place, however, to exuberant joy and exaltation. Of
average intelligence, without special gifts, neither musical nor fond
of books, her preference is for handwork--and day dreaming. She was
often absent-minded, misread in a peculiar way when reading aloud,
instead of the word _Ziege_ (goat), for instance, said _Gais_, instead
of _Treppe_ (stair), _Stege_; this occurred so often that her brothers
and sisters laughed at her. There were no other abnormalities; there
were no serious hysterical manifestations. Her family were artisans and
business people with very limited interests. Books of mystical content
were never permitted in the family. Her education was faulty; there
were numerous brothers and sisters and thus the education was given
indiscriminately, and in addition the children had to suffer a great
deal from the inconsequent and vulgar, indeed sometimes rough, treatment
of their mother. The father, a very busy business man, could not pay
much attention to his children, and died when S. W. was not yet grown
up. Under these uncomfortable conditions it is no wonder that S. W.
felt herself shut in and unhappy. She was often afraid to go home, and
preferred to be anywhere rather than there. She was left a great deal
with playmates and grew up in this way without much polish. The level
of her education is relatively low and her interests correspondingly
limited. Her knowledge of literature is also very limited. She knows
the common school songs by heart, songs of Schiller and Goethe and a
few other poets, as well as fragments from a song book and the psalms.
Newspaper stories represent her highest level in prose. Up to the time
of her somnambulism she had never read any books of a serious nature.
At home and from friends she heard about table-turning and began to
take an interest in it. She asked to be allowed to take part in such
experiments, and her desire was soon gratified. In July 1899, she took
part a few times in table-turnings with some friends and her brothers
and sisters, but in joke. It was then discovered that she was an
excellent "medium." Some communications of a serious nature arrived
which were received with general astonishment. Their pastoral tone
was surprising. The spirit said he was the grandfather of the medium.
As I was acquainted with the family I was able to take part in these
experiments. At the beginning of August, 1899, the first attacks of
somnambulism took place in my presence. They took the following course:
S. W. became very pale, slowly sank to the ground, or into a chair, shut
her eyes, became cataleptic, drew several deep breaths, and began to
speak. In this stage she was generally quite relaxed; the reflexes of
the lids remained, as did also tactile sensation. She was sensitive to
unexpected noises and full of fear, especially in the initial stage.

She did not react when called by name. In somnambulic dialogues she
copied in a remarkably clever way her dead relations and acquaintances,
with all their peculiarities, so that she made a lasting impression
upon unprejudiced persons. She also so closely imitated persons whom
she only knew from descriptions that no one could deny her at least
considerable talent as an actress. Gradually gestures were added to
the simple speech, which finally led to "_attitudes passionelles_" and
complete dramatic scenes. She took up postures of prayer and rapture,
with staring eyes, and spoke with impassionate and glowing rhetoric. She
then made use exclusively of a literary German which she spoke with an
ease and assurance quite contrary to her usual uncertain and embarrassed
manner in the waking state. Her movements were free and of a noble
grace, depicting most beautifully her varying emotions. Her attitude
during these states was always changing and diverse in the different
attacks. Now she would lie for ten minutes to two hours on the sofa or
the ground, motionless, with closed eyes; now she assumed a half-sitting
posture and spoke with changed tone and speech; now she would stand
up, going through every possible pantomimic gesture. Her speech was
equally diversified and without rule. Now she spoke in the first person,
but never for long, generally to prophesy her next attack; now she
spoke of herself (and this was the most usual) in the third person.
She then acted as some other person, either some dead acquaintance or
some chance person, whose part she consistently carried out according
to the characteristics she herself conceived. At the end of the ecstasy
there usually followed a cataleptic state with _flexibilitas cerea_,
which gradually passed over into the waking state. The waxy anæmic
pallor which was an almost constant feature of the attacks made one
really anxious; it sometimes occurred at the beginning of the attack,
but often in the second half only. The pulse was then small but regular
and of normal frequency; the breathing gentle, shallow, or almost
imperceptible. As already stated, S. W. often predicted her attacks
beforehand; just before the attacks she had strange sensations, became
excited, rather anxious, and occasionally expressed thoughts of death:
"she will probably die in one of these attacks; during the attack her
soul only hangs to her body by a thread, so that often the body could
scarcely go on living." Once after the cataleptic attack tachypnoea
lasting two minutes was observed, with a respiration rate of 100 per
minute. At first the attacks occurred spontaneously, afterwards S. W.
could provoke them by sitting in a dark corner and covering her face
with her hands. Frequently the experiment did not succeed. She had
so-called "good" and "bad" days. The question of amnesia after the
attacks is unfortunately very obscure. This much is certain, that after
each attack she was quite accurately orientated as to what she had gone
through "during the rapture." It is, however, uncertain how much she
remembered of the conversations in which she served as medium, and of
changes in her surroundings during the attack. It often seemed that
she did have a fleeting recollection, for directly after waking she
would ask: "Who was here? Wasn't X or Y here? What did he say?" She
also showed that she was superficially aware of the content of the
conversations. She thus often remarked that the spirits had communicated
to her before waking what they had said. But frequently this was not
the case. If, at her request, the contents of the trance speeches were
repeated to her she was often annoyed about them. She was then often
sad and depressed for hours together, especially when any unpleasant
indiscretions had occurred. She would then rail against the spirits and
assert that next time she would beg her guides to keep such spirits far
away. Her indignation was not feigned, for in the waking state she could
but poorly control herself and her emotions, so that every mood was at
once mirrored in her face. At times she seemed only slightly or not at
all aware of the external proceedings during the attack. She seldom
noticed when any one left the room or came in. Once she forbade me to
enter the room when she was awaiting special communications which she
wished to keep secret from me. Nevertheless I went in, and sat down with
the three other sitters and listened to everything. Her eyes were open
and she spoke to those present without noticing me. She only noticed me
when I began to speak, which gave rise to a storm of indignation. She
remembered better, but still apparently only in indefinite outlines, the
remarks of those taking part which referred to the trance speeches or
directly to herself. I could never discover any definite rapport in this
connection.

In addition to these great attacks which seemed to follow a certain law
in their course, S. W. produced a great number of other automatisms.
Premonitions, forebodings, unaccountable moods and rapidly changing
fancies were all in the day's work. I never observed simple states of
sleep. On the other hand, I soon noticed that in the middle of a lively
conversation S. W. became quite confused and spoke without meaning in
a peculiar monotonous way, and looked in front of her dreamily with
half-closed eyes. These lapses usually lasted but a few minutes. Then
she would suddenly proceed: "Yes, what did you say?" At first she
would not give any particulars about these lapses, she would reply
off-hand that she was a little giddy, had a headache, and so on.
Later she simply said: "they were there again," meaning her spirits.
She was subjected to the lapses much against her will; she often tried
to defend herself: "I do not want to, not now, come some other time;
you seem to think I only exist for you." She had these lapses in the
streets, in business, in fact anywhere. If this happened to her in
the street, she leaned against a house and waited till the attack was
over. During these attacks, whose intensity was most variable, she
had visions; frequently also, especially during the attacks where she
turned extremely pale, she "wandered"; or as she expressed it, lost
her body, and got away to distant places whither her spirits led her.
Distant journeys during ecstasy strained her exceedingly; she was
often exhausted for hours after, and many times complained that the
spirits had again deprived her of much power, such overstrain was now
too much for her; the spirits must get another medium, etc. Once she
was hysterically blind for half an hour after one of these ecstasies.
Her gait was hesitating, feeling her way; she had to be led; she did
not see the candle which was on the table. The pupils reacted. Visions
occurred in great numbers without proper "lapses" (designating by this
word only the higher grade of distraction of attention). At first the
visions only occurred at the beginning of the sleep. Once after S. W.
had gone to bed the room became lighted up, and out of the general foggy
light there appeared white glittering figures. They were throughout
concealed in white veil-like robes, the women had a head-covering like
a turban, and a girdle. Afterwards (according to the statements of S.
W.), "the spirits were already there" when she went to bed. Finally she
also saw the figures in bright daylight, though still somewhat blurred
and only for a short time, provided there were no proper lapses, in
which case the figures became solid enough to take hold of. But S. W.
always preferred darkness. According to her account the content of the
vision was for the most part of a pleasant kind. Gazing at the beautiful
figures she received a feeling of delicious blessedness. More rarely
there were terrible visions of a dæmonic nature. These were entirely
confined to the night or to dark rooms. Occasionally S. W. saw black
figures in the neighbouring streets or in her room; once out in the dark
courtyard she saw a terrible copper-red face which suddenly stared at
her and frightened her. I could not learn anything satisfactory about
the first occurrence of the vision. She states that once at night, in
her fifth or sixth year, she saw her "guide," her grandfather (whom she
had never known). I could not get any objective confirmation from her
relatives of this early vision. Nothing of the kind is said to have
happened until her first séance. With the exception of the hypnagogic
brightness and the flashes, there were no rudimentary hallucinations,
but from the beginning they were of a systematic nature, involving all
the sense-organs equally. So far as concerns the intellectual reaction
to these phenomena it is remarkable with what curious sincerity she
regarded her dreams. Her entire somnambulic development, the innumerable
puzzling events, seemed to her quite natural. She looked at her whole
past in this light. Every striking event of earlier years stood to her
in necessary and clear relationship to her present condition. She was
happy in the consciousness of having found her real life-task. Naturally
she was unswervingly convinced of the reality of her visions. I often
tried to present her with some sceptical explanation, but she invariably
turned this aside; in her usual condition she did not clearly grasp a
reasoned explanation, and in the semi-somnambulic state she regarded
it as senseless in view of the facts staring her in the face. She once
said: "I do not know if what the spirits say and teach me is true,
neither do I know if they are those by whose names they call themselves,
but that my spirits exist there is no question. I see them before me, I
can touch them, I speak to them about everything I wish, as naturally
as I'm now talking to you. They must be real." She absolutely would
not listen to the idea that the manifestations were a kind of illness.
Doubts about her health or about the reality of her dream would distress
her deeply; she felt so hurt by my remarks that when I was present she
became reserved, and for a long time refused to experiment if I was
there; hence I took care not to express my doubts and thoughts aloud.
From her immediate relatives and acquaintances she received undivided
allegiance and admiration--they asked her advice about all kinds of
things. In time she obtained such an influence upon her followers that
three of her brothers and sisters likewise began to have hallucinations
of a similar kind. Their hallucinations generally began as night-dreams
of a very vivid and dramatic kind; these gradually extended into the
waking time, partly hypnagogic, partly hypnopompic. A married sister
had extraordinary vivid dreams which developed from night to night,
and these appeared in the waking consciousness; at first as obscure
illusions, next as real hallucinations, but they never reached the
plastic clearness of S. W.'s visions. For instance, she once saw in a
dream a black dæmonic figure at her bedside in animated conversation
with a white, beautiful figure, which tried to restrain the black one;
nevertheless the black one seized her and tried to choke her, then
she awoke. Bending over her she then saw a black shadow with a human
contour, and near by a white cloudy figure. The vision only disappeared
when she lighted a candle. Similar visions were repeated dozens of
times. The visions of the other two sisters were of a similar kind, but
less intense.

This particular type of attack with the complete visions and ideas had
developed in the course of less than a month, but never afterwards
exceeded these limits. What was later added to these was but the
extension of all those thoughts and cycles of visions which to a
certain extent were already indicated quite at the beginning. As well
as the "great" attacks and the lesser ones, there must also be noted
a third kind of state comparable to "lapse" states. These are the
_semi-somnambulic states_. They appeared at the beginning or at the
end of the "great" attacks, but also appeared without any connection
with them. They developed gradually in the course of the first month.
It is not possible to give a more precise account of the time of their
appearance. In this state a fixed gaze, brilliant eyes, and a certain
dignity and stateliness of movement are noticeable. In this phase S. W.
is herself, her own somnambulic ego.

She is fully orientated to the external world, but seems to stand
with one foot, as it were, in her dream-world. She sees and hears her
spirits, sees how they walk about in the room among those who form
the circle, and stand first by one person, then by another. She is in
possession of a clear remembrance of her visions, her journeys and the
instructions she receives. She speaks quietly, clearly and firmly and
is always in a serious, almost religious frame of mind. Her bearing
indicates a deeply religious mood, free from all pietistic flavour, her
speech is singularly uninfluenced by her guide's jargon compounded of
Bible and tract. Her solemn behaviour has a suffering, rather pitiful
aspect. She is painfully conscious of the great differences between
her ideal world at night and the rough reality of the day. This state
stands in sharp contrast to her waking existence; there is here no
trace of that unstable and inharmonious creature, that extravagant
nervous temperament which is so characteristic for the rest of her
relationships. Speaking with her, you get the impression of speaking
with a much older person who has attained through numerous experiences
to a sure harmonious footing. In this state she produced her best
results, whilst her romances correspond more closely to the conditions
of her waking interests. The semi-somnambulism usually appears
spontaneously, mostly during the table experiments, which sometimes
announced by this means that S. W. was beginning to know beforehand
every automatic communication from the table. She then usually stopped
the table-turning and after a short time passed more or less suddenly
into an ecstatic state. S. W. showed herself to be very sensitive. She
could divine and reply to simple questions thought of by a member of the
circle who was not a "medium," if only the latter would lay a hand on
the table or on her hand. Genuine thought-transference without direct
or indirect contact could never be achieved. In juxtaposition with the
obvious development of her whole personality the continued existence of
her earlier ordinary character was all the more startling. She imparted
with unconcealed pleasure all the little childish experiences, the
flirtations and love-secrets, all the rudeness and lack of education
of her parents and contemporaries. To every one who did not know her
secret she was a girl of fifteen and a half, in no respect unlike a
thousand other such girls. So much the greater was people's astonishment
when they got to know her in her other aspect. Her near relatives could
not at first grasp this change: to some extent they never altogether
understood it, so there was often bitter strife in the family, some of
them taking sides for and others against S. W., either with enthusiastic
over-valuation or with contemptuous censure of "superstition." Thus
did S. W., during the time I watched her closely, lead a curious,
contradictory life, a real "double life" with two personalities existing
side by side or closely following upon one another and contending for
the mastery. I now give some of the most interesting details of the
sittings in chronological order.

First and second sittings, August, 1899. S. W. at once undertook to
lead the "communications." The "psychograph," for which an upturned
glass tumbler was used, on which two fingers of the right hand were
laid, moved quick as lightning from letter to letter. (Slips of paper,
marked with letter and numbers, had been arranged in a circle round
the glass.) It was communicated that the "medium's" grandfather was
present and would speak to us. There then followed many communications
in quick sequence, of a most religious, edifying nature, in part in
properly made words, partly in words with the letters transposed, and
partly in a series of reversed letters. The last words and sentences
were produced so quickly that it was not possible to follow without
first inverting the letters. The communications were once interrupted in
abrupt fashion by a new communication, which announced the presence of
the writer's grandfather. On this occasion the jesting observation was
made: "Evidently the two 'spirits' get on very badly together." During
this attempt darkness came on. Suddenly S. W. became very disturbed,
sprang up in terror, fell on her knees and cried "There, there, do you
not see that light, that star there?" and pointed to a dark corner of
the room. She became more and more disturbed, and called for a light in
terror. She was pale, wept, "it was all so strange, she did not know in
the least what was the matter with her." When a candle was brought she
became calm again. The experiments were now stopped.

At the next sitting, which took place in the evening, two days later,
similar communications from S. W.'s grandfather were obtained. When
darkness fell S. W. suddenly leaned back on the sofa, grew pale, almost
shut her eyes, and lay there motionless. The eyeballs were turned
upwards, the lid-reflex was present as well as tactile sensation. The
breathing was gentle, almost imperceptible. The pulse small and weak.
This attack lasted about half an hour, when S. W. suddenly sighed and
got up. The extreme pallor, which had lasted throughout the whole
attack, now gave place to her usual pale pink colour. She was somewhat
confused and distraught, indicated that she had seen all sorts of
things, but would tell nothing. Only after urgent questioning would
she relate that in an extraordinary waking condition she had seen her
grandfather arm-in-arm with the writer's grandfather. The two had gone
rapidly by in an open carriage, side by side.

III. In the third séance, which took place some days later, there was a
similar attack of more than half an hour's duration. S. W. afterwards
told of many white, transfigured forms who each gave her a flower
of special symbolic significance. Most of them were dead relatives.
Concerning the exact content of their talk she maintained an obstinate
silence.

IV. After S. W. had entered into the somnambulic state she began to make
curious movements with her lips, and made swallowing gurgling noises.
Then she whispered very softly and unintelligibly. When this had lasted
some minutes she suddenly began to speak in an altered deep voice. She
spoke of herself in the third person. "She is not here, she has gone
away." There followed several communications of a religious kind. From
the content and the way of speaking it was easy to conclude that she
was imitating her grandfather, who had been a clergyman. The content of
the talk did not rise above the mental level of the "communications."
The tone of the voice was somewhat forced, and only became natural when,
in the course of the talk, the voice approximated to the medium's own.

(In later sittings the voice was only altered for a few moments when a
new spirit manifested itself.)

Afterwards there was amnesia for the trance-conversation. She gave hints
about a sojourn in the other world, and she spoke of an undreamed-of
blessedness which she felt. It must be further noted that her
conversation in the attack occurred quite spontaneously, and was not in
response to any suggestions.

Directly after this séance S. W. became acquainted with the book of
Justinus Kerner, "Die Seherin von Prevorst." She began thereupon to
magnetise herself towards the end of the attack, partly by means of
regular passes, partly by curious circles and figures of eight, which
she described symmetrically with both arms. She did this, she said,
to disperse the severe headaches which occurred after the attacks. In
the August séances, not detailed here, there were in addition to the
grandfather numerous spirits of other relatives who did not produce
anything very remarkable. Each time when a new one came on the scene the
movement of the glass was changed in a striking way; it generally ran
along the rows of letters, touching one or other of them, but no sense
could be made of it. The orthography was very uncertain and arbitrary,
and the first sentences were frequently incomprehensible or broken
up into a meaningless medley of letters. Generally automatic writing
suddenly began at this point. Sometimes automatic writing was attempted
during complete darkness. The movements began with violent backward
jerks of the whole arm, so that the paper was pierced by the pencil. The
first attempt at writing consisted of numerous strokes and zigzag lines
about 8 cm. high. In later attempts there came first unreadable words,
in large handwriting, which gradually became smaller and clearer. It
was not essentially different from the medium's own. The grandfather was
again the controlling spirit.

V. Somnambulic attacks in September, 1899. S. W. sits upon the sofa,
leans back, shuts her eyes, breathes lightly and regularly. She
gradually becomes cataleptic, the catalepsy disappears after about
two minutes, when she lies in an apparently quiet sleep with complete
muscular relaxation. She suddenly begins to speak in a subdued voice:
"No! you take the red, I'll take the white, you can take the green,
and you the blue. Are you ready? We will go now." (A pause of several
minutes during which her face assumes a corpse-like pallor. Her hands
feel cold and are very bloodless.) She suddenly calls out with a
loud, solemn voice: "Albert, Albert, Albert," then whispering: "Now
you speak," followed by a longer pause, when the pallor of the face
attains the highest possible degree. Again, in a loud solemn voice,
"Albert, Albert, do you not believe your father? I tell you many errors
are contained in N.'s teaching. Think about it." Pause. The pallor
of the face decreases. "He's very frightened. He could not speak any
more." (These words in her usual conversational tone.) Pause. "He will
certainly think about it," S. W. now speaks again in the same tone,
in a strange idiom which sounds like French or Italian, now recalling
the former, now the latter. She speaks fluently, rapidly, and with
charm. It is possible to understand a few words but not to remember the
whole, because the language is so strange. From time to time certain
words recur, as _wena_, _wenes_, _wenai_, _wene_, etc. The absolute
naturalness of the proceedings is bewildering. From time to time she
pauses as if some one were answering her. Suddenly she speaks in German,
"Is time already up?" (In a troubled voice.) "Must I go already?
Goodbye, goodbye." With the last words there passes over her face an
indescribable expression of ecstatic blessedness. She raises her arms,
opens her eyes,--hitherto closed,--looks radiantly upwards. She remains
a moment thus, then her arms sink slackly, her eyes shut, the expression
of her face is tired and exhausted. After a short cataleptic stage she
awakes with a sigh. She looks around astonished: "I've slept again,
haven't I?" She is told she has been talking during the sleep, whereupon
she becomes much annoyed, and this increases when she learns she has
spoken in a foreign tongue. "But didn't I tell the spirits I don't want
it? It mustn't be. It exhausts me too much." Begins to cry. "Oh, God!
Oh, God! must then everything, everything, come back again like last
time? Is nothing spared me?" The next day at the same time there was
another attack. When S. W. has fallen asleep Ulrich von Gerbenstein
suddenly announces himself. He is an entertaining chatterer, speaks very
fluently in high German with a North-German accent. Asked what S. W. is
now doing, after much circumlocution he explains that she is far away,
and he is meanwhile here to look after her body, the circulation of the
blood, the respiration, etc. He must take care that meanwhile no black
person takes possession of her and harms her. Upon urgent questioning
he relates that S. W. has gone with the others to Japan, to appear to
a distant relative and to restrain him from a stupid marriage. He then
announces in a whisper the exact moment when the manifestation takes
place. Forbidden any conversation for a few minutes, he points to the
sudden pallor occurring in S. W., remarking that materialisation at such
a great distance is at the cost of correspondingly great force. He then
orders cold bandages to the head to alleviate the severe headache which
would occur afterwards. As the colour of the face gradually becomes more
natural the conversation grows livelier. All kinds of childish jokes and
trivialities are uttered; suddenly U. von G. says, "I see them coming,
but they are still very far off; I see them there like a star." S. W.
points to the North. We are naturally astonished, and ask why they do
not come from the East, whereto U. von G. laughingly retorts: "Oh, but
they come the direct way over the North Pole. I am going now; farewell."
Immediately after S. W. sighs, wakes up, is ill-tempered, complains of
extremely bad headache. She saw U. von G. standing by her body; what
had he told us? She gets angry about the "silly chatter" from which he
cannot refrain.

VI. Begins in the usual way. Extreme pallor; lies stretched out,
scarcely breathing. Speaks suddenly, with loud, solemn voice: "Yes,
be frightened; I am; I warn you against N.'s teaching. See, in hope
is everything that belongs to faith. You would like to know who I
am. God gives where one least expects it. Do you not know me?" Then
unintelligible whispering; after a few minutes she awakes.

VII. S. W. soon falls asleep; lies stretched out on the sofa. Is very
pale. Says nothing, sighs deeply from time to time. Casts up her eyes,
rises, sits on the sofa, bends forward, speaks softly: "You have sinned
grievously, have fallen far." Bends forward still, as if speaking to
some one who kneels before her. She stands up, turns to the right,
stretches out her hands, and points to the spot over which she has been
bending. "Will you forgive her?" she asks, loudly. "Do not forgive men,
but their spirits. Not she, but her human body has sinned." Then she
kneels down, remains quite still for about ten minutes in the attitude
of prayer. Then she gets up suddenly, looks to heaven with ecstatic
expression, and then throws herself again on her knees, with her face
bowed on her hands, whispering incomprehensible words. She remains rigid
in this position several minutes. Then she gets up, looks again upwards
with a radiant countenance, and lies down on the sofa; soon after she
wakes.
