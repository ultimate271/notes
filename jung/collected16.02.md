## PART I

Psychiatry is the stepchild of medicine. All the other branches of
medicine have one great advantage over it--the scientific methods can be
applied; there are things to be seen, and felt, physical and chemical
methods of investigation to be followed: the microscope shows the
dreaded bacillus, the surgeon's knife halts at no difficulty and gives
us glimpses of most inaccessible organs of vital importance. Psychiatry,
which engages in the exploration of the mind, stands ever at the door
seeking in vain to weigh and measure as in the other departments of
science. We have long known that we have to do with a definite organ,
the brain; but only beyond the brain, beyond the morphological basis
do we reach what is important for us--the mind; as indefinable as it
ever was, still eluding any explanation, no matter how ingenious.
Former ages, endowing the mind with substance, and personifying every
incomprehensible occurrence in nature, regarded mental disorder as the
work of evil spirits; the patient was looked upon as one possessed,
and the methods of treatment were such as fitted this conception. This
mediæval conception occasionally gains credence and expression even
to-day. A classical example is the driving out of the devil which
the elder Pastor Blumhardt carried out successfully in the famous
case of Gottlieb in Deltus.[196] To the honour of the Middle Ages
let it also be said that there are to be found early evidences of a
sound rationalism. In the sixteenth century at the Julius Hospital in
Würzburg mental patients were already treated side by side with others
physically ill, and the treatment seems to have been really humane.
With the opening of the modern era, and with the dawn of the first
scientific ideas, the original barbaric personification of the unknown
Great Power gradually disappeared. A change arose in the conception of
mental disease in favour of a more philosophic moral attitude. The old
view that every misfortune was the revenge of the offended gods returned
new-clothed to fit the times. Just as physical diseases can, in many
cases, be regarded as self-inflicted on account of negligence, mental
diseases were likewise considered to be due to some moral injury, or
sin. Behind this conception the angry godhead also stood. Such views
played a great _rôle_, right up to the beginning of last century,
especially in Germany. In France, however, about the same time a new
idea was appearing, destined to sway psychiatry for a hundred years.
Pinel, whose statue fittingly stands at the gateway of the Salpetrière
in Paris, took away the chains from the insane and thus freed them from
the symbol of the criminal. In a very real way he formulated for the
world the humane and scientific conception of modern times. A little
later Esquirol and Bayle discovered that certain forms of insanity ended
in death, after a relatively short time, and that certain constant
changes in the brain could be demonstrated _post mortem_. Esquirol had
described as an entity general paralysis of the insane, or as it was
popularly called "softening of the brain," a disease which is always
bound up with chronic inflammatory degeneration of the cerebral matter.
Thus was laid the foundation of the dogma which you will find repeated
in every text-book of psychiatry, viz. "diseases of the mind are
diseases of the brain." Confirmation of this conception was added about
the same time by Gall's discoveries which traced partial or complete
loss of the power of speech--a psychical capacity--to a lesion in the
region of the left lower frontal convolution. Somewhat later this view
proved to be of general applicability. Innumerable cases of extreme
idiocy or other intense mental disorders were found to be caused by
tumours of the brain. Towards the end of the nineteenth century Wernicke
(recently deceased) localised the speech centre in the left temporal
lobe. This epoch-making discovery raised hopes to the highest pitch.
It was expected that at no distant day every characteristic and every
psychical activity would be assigned a place in the cortical grey
matter. Gradually, increased attempts were made to trace the primary
mental changes in the psychoses back to certain parallel changes in the
brain. Meynert, the famous Viennese psychiatrist, described a formal
scheme in which the alteration in blood-supply in certain regions was
to play the chief part in the origin of the psychoses. Wernicke made a
similar but far more ingenious attempt at a morphological explanation
of psychical disorders. The visible result of this tendency is seen in
the fact that even the smallest and least renowned asylum has, to-day,
its anatomical laboratory where cerebral sections are cut, stained, and
microscoped. Our numerous psychiatric journals are full of morphological
contributions, investigations into the structure and distribution of
cells in the cortex, and other varying source of disorders in the
different mental diseases.

Psychiatry has come into fame as gross materialism. And quite rightly,
for it is on the road--or rather reached it long ago--to put the organ,
the instrument, above function. Function has become the dependent
accessory of its organs, the mind the dependent accessory of the brain.
In modern mental therapy the mind has been the loser, whilst great
progress has been made in cerebral anatomy; of the mind we know less
than nothing. Current psychiatry behaves like a man who thinks he can
unriddle the meaning and importance of a building by a mineralogical
investigation of its stones. Let us attempt to realise in which mental
diseases obvious changes in the brain are found, and what is their
proportion.

In the last four years we have received 1325 patients at Burgholzi;[197]
331 a year. Of these 9 per cent. suffered from congenital psychic
anomalies. By this is understood a certain inborn defect of the psyche.
Of these 9 per cent., about a quarter were imbeciles. Here we meet
certain changes in the brain such as microcephalus, hydrocephalus,
malformations or absence of portions of the brain. The remaining
three-quarters of these congenital defects present no typical changes in
the brain.

Three per cent. of our patients suffer from epileptic mental troubles.
In the course of epilepsy there arises gradually a typical degeneration
of the brain. The degeneration is, however, only discoverable in severe
cases and when the disease has existed for some time. If the attacks
have only existed for a relatively short time, not more than a few
years, the brain as a rule shows nothing. Seventeen per cent. of our
patients suffer from progressive paralysis and senile dementia. Both
diseases present characteristic changes in the brain. In paralysis there
is most extensive shrinkage of the brain, so that the cortex is often
reduced by one half. The frontal portions of the brain more especially,
may be reduced to a third of the normal weight. There is a similar
destruction of substance in senile decay.

Fourteen per cent. of the patients annually received are cases of
poisoning, at least 13 per cent. of these being due to alcohol. As a
rule in slight cases nothing is to be found in the brain; in only a
relatively few severe cases is there shrinkage of the cortex, generally
of slight degree. The number of these severe cases amounts to less than
1 per cent. of the yearly cases of alcoholism.

Six per cent. of the patients suffer from so-called maniacal depressive
insanity which includes the maniacs and the melancholics. The essence
of this disease is readily intelligible to the public. Melancholia is
a condition of abnormal sadness without disorder of intelligence or
memory. Mania is the opposite, the rule being an abnormally excited
state with great restlessness; likewise without deep disturbance of
intelligence and memory. In this disease there are no demonstrable
morphological changes in the brain.

Forty-five per cent. of the patients suffer from the real and common
mental disease called dementia præcox. The name is a very unhappy one,
for the dementia is not always precocious, nor in all cases is there
dementia. Unfortunately the disease is too often incurable; even in the
best cases, in those that recover, where the outside public would not
observe any abnormality, there is always present some defect in the
emotional life. The picture presented by the disease is extraordinarily
diverse; generally there is some disorder of feeling, frequently
delusions and hallucinations. As a rule there is nothing to be found in
the brain. Even in cases of a most severe type, lasting for years, an
intact brain is not infrequently found _post mortem_. In a few cases
only certain slight changes are present which, however, cannot as yet be
reduced to any law.

To sum up: in round figures a quarter of our insane patients show more
or less clearly extensive changes and destruction of the brain, while
three-fourths have a brain which seems to be generally unimpaired or at
most exhibit such changes as give no explanation of the psychological
disturbance.

These figures offer the best possible proof that the purely
morphological view-point of modern psychiatry leads only very
indirectly, if at all, to the understanding of the mental disorder,
which is our aim. We must take into account the fact that those mental
diseases which show the most marked disturbances of the brain end in
death; for this reason the chronic inmates of the asylum form its real
population, consisting of some 70 to 80 per cent. of cases of dementia
præcox, that is, of patients in whom anatomical changes are practically
non-existent. The psychiatry of the future must come to grips with the
core of the thing; the path is thus made clear--_it can only be by way
of psychology_. Hence in our Zürich clinic we have entirely discarded
the anatomical view and turned to the psychological investigation of
insanity. As most of our patients suffer from dementia præcox we were
naturally concerned with this as our chief problem.

       *       *       *       *       *

The older asylum physicians paid great attention to the psychological
precursors of mental disorder, just as the public still does, following
a true instinct. We accepted this hint and carefully investigated the
previous psychological history wherever possible. Our trouble was richly
rewarded, for we often found, to our surprise, that the disease broke
out at a moment of some great emotion which, in its turn, had arisen in
a so-called normal way. We found, moreover, that in the mental disease
which ensued a number of symptoms occurred which it was quite labour in
vain to study from the morphological standpoint. These same symptoms,
however, were comprehensible when considered from the standpoint of the
individual's previous history. Freud's fundamental investigations into
the psychology of hysteria and dreams afforded us the greatest stimulus
and help in our work.

A few instances of the latest method in psychiatry will make the
subject clearer than mere dry theory. In order to bring home to you the
difference in our conception I will first describe the medical history
in the older fashion, and subsequently give the solution characteristic
of the new departure.

The case to be considered is that of a cook aged 32; she had no
hereditary taint, was always industrious and conscientious, and had
never been noticeable for eccentric behaviour or the like. Quite
recently she became acquainted with a young man whom she wished to
marry. From that time on she began to show certain peculiarities. She
often spoke of his not liking her much, was frequently out of sorts,
ill-tempered, and sat alone brooding; once she ornamented her Sunday hat
very strikingly with red and green feathers, another day she bought a
pair of pince-nez in order to wear them when she went out walking with
her fiancé. One day the sudden idea that her teeth were rather ugly
would not let her rest, and she resolved to get a plate, although there
was no absolute need. She had all her teeth out under an anæsthetic. The
night after the operation she suddenly had a severe anxiety-attack. She
cried and moaned that she was damned for ever, for she had committed
a great sin; she should not have allowed her teeth to be extracted.
People must pray for her, that God might pardon her sin. In vain her
friends attempted to talk her out of her fears, to assure her that the
extraction of teeth was really no sin; it availed nothing. At day-break
she became somewhat quieter; she worked throughout the day. On following
nights the attacks were repeated. When consulted by the patient I found
her quiet, but she wore a rather vacant expression. I talked to her
about the operation, and she assured me it was not so dreadful to have
teeth extracted, but still it was a great sin, from which position,
despite every persuasion, she could not be moved. She continually
repeated in plaintive, pathetic tones, "I should not have allowed my
teeth to be extracted; oh yes, that was a great sin which God will never
forgive me." She gave the impression of real insanity. A few days later
her condition grew worse, and she had to be brought into the asylum. The
anxiety-attack had extended and was persistent, and the mental disorder
lasted for months.

The history shows a series of entirely unrelated symptoms. Why all the
queer story of the hat and pince-nez? Why those anxiety-attacks? Why
this delusion that the extraction of her teeth was an unpardonable
sin? Nothing here is clear. The morphologically-minded psychiatrist
would say: This is just a typical case of dementia præcox; it is the
essence of insanity, of madness, to talk of nothing but mysteries;
the standpoint of the diseased mind towards the world is displaced,
is "mad." What is no sin for the normal, the patient finds a sin.
It is a bizarre delusion characteristic of dementia præcox. The
extravagant lamentation about this supposed sin is what is known as
"inadequate"[198] emotional emphasis. The queer ornamentation of the
hat, the pince-nez, are bizarre notions such as are very common in
these patients. Somewhere in the brain certain cells have fallen into
disorder, and manufacture illogical, senseless ideas of one kind and
another which are quite without psychological meaning. The patient is
obviously a hereditary degenerate with a weak brain, having a kink
which is the origin of the disorder. For some reason or other the
disease has suddenly broken out. It could just as easily have broken
out at any other time. Perhaps we should have had to capitulate to
these arguments had real psychological analysis not come to our aid. In
filling up the certificate required for her removal to the asylum, it
transpired that many years ago she had had an affair which terminated;
her lover left her with an illegitimate child. Nobody had been told of
this. When she was again in love a dilemma arose, and she asked herself,
What will this new lover say about it? At first she postponed the
marriage, becoming more and more worried, and then the eccentricities
began. To understand these we must immerse ourselves in the psychology
of a naïve soul. If we have to disclose some painful secret to a beloved
person we try first to strengthen his love in order to obtain beforehand
a guarantee of his forgiveness. We do it by flattery or by caresses, or
we try to impress the value of our own personality in order to raise it
in the eyes of the other. Our patient decked herself out with beautiful
feathers, which to her simple taste seemed precious. The wearing of
"pince-nez" increases the respect of children even of a mature age.
And who does not know people who will have their teeth extracted, out
of pure vanity, in order that they may wear a plate to improve their
appearance?

After such an operation most people have a slight, nervous reaction, and
then everything becomes more difficult to bear. This was, as a matter
of fact, just the moment when the catastrophe did occur, in her terror
lest her fiancé should break with her when he heard of her previous
life. That was the first anxiety-attack. Just as the patient had not
acknowledged her secret in all these years, so she now sought to guard
it, and shifted the fear in her guilty conscience on to the extraction
of the teeth; she thus followed a method well known to us, for when we
dare not acknowledge some great sin we deplore some small sin with the
greater emphasis.

The problem seemed insoluble to the weak and sensitive mind of the
patient, hence the affect became insurmountably great; this is the
mental desire as presented from the psychological side. The series
of apparently meaningless events, the so-called madness, have now a
meaning; a significance appertains to the delusions, making the patient
more human to us. Here is a person like ourselves, beset by universal
human problems, no longer merely a cerebral machine thrown out of gear.
Hitherto we thought that the insane patient revealed nothing to us by
symptoms, save the senseless products of his disordered cerebral cells,
but that was academic wisdom reeking of the study. When we penetrate
into the human secrets of our patients, we recognise mental disease
to be an unusual reaction to emotional problems which are in no wise
foreign to ourselves, and the delusion discloses the psychological
system upon which it is based.

The light which shines forth from this conception seems to us so
enormously powerful because it forces us into the innermost depths
of that tremendous disorder which is most common in our asylums, and
hitherto least understood; by reason of the craziness of the symptoms it
is the type that strikes the public as madness _in excelsis_.

The case which I have just sketched is a simple one. It is transparent.
My second example is somewhat more complicated. It is the case of a man
between 30 and 40 years of age; he is a foreign archæologist of great
learning and most unusual intelligence. He was a precocious boy of quite
excellent character, great sensitiveness and rare gifts. Physically he
was small, always weakly, and a stammerer. He grew up and was educated
abroad, and afterwards studied for several terms at B----. So far there
had been no disorder of any kind. On the completion of his university
career he became zealously absorbed in his archæological work, which
gradually engulfed him to such an extent that he was dead to the world
and all its pleasures. He worked incessantly, and buried himself
entirely in his books. He became quite unsociable; before, awkward and
shy in society, he now fled from it altogether, and saw no one beyond
a few friends. He thus led the life of a hermit devoted entirely to
science. A few years later, on a holiday tour, he revisited B----,
where he remained a few days. He walked a great deal in the environs
of the town. His few acquaintances now found him somewhat strange,
taciturn, and nervous. After a somewhat protracted walk he seemed tired,
and said that he did not feel very well. He then remarked he must get
himself hypnotised, he felt his nerves unsteady. On top of this he was
attacked by physical illness, viz. inflammation of the lungs. Very
soon a peculiar state of excitement supervened which led to suicidal
ideas. He was brought to the asylum, where for weeks he remained in
an extremely excited state. He was completely deranged, and did not
know where he was; he spoke in broken sentences which no one could
understand. He was often so excited and aggressive that it took several
attendants to hold him. He gradually became quieter, and one day came to
himself, as if waking out of a long, confused dream. He soon completely
regained his health, and was discharged as cured. He returned to his
home and again immersed himself in books. In the following years he
published several remarkable works, but, as before, his life was that
of a hermit living entirely in his books and dead to the world. He then
gradually acquired the name of a dried-up misanthrope, lost to all
meaning of the beauty of life. A few years after his first illness a
brief holiday brought him again to B----. As before he took his solitary
walks in the environs. One day he was suddenly overcome by a faint
feeling, and lay down in the street. He was carried into a neighbouring
house where he immediately became extremely excited. He began to perform
gymnastics, jumped over the rails of the bed, turned somersaults in the
room, began to declaim in a loud, voice, sang his own improvisations,
etc. He was again brought to the asylum. The excitement continued. He
extolled his wonderful muscles, his beautiful figure, his enormous
strength. He believed that he had discovered a natural law by which
a wonderful voice could be developed. He regarded himself as a great
singer, and a marvellous reciter, and at the same time he was a great
inspired poet and composer to whom verse and melody came spontaneously.

All this was in pitiable and very remarkable contrast to reality. He is
a small weakly man of unimposing build, with poorly developed muscles
betraying at the first glance the atrophying effect of his studious
life. He is unmusical, his voice is weak and he sings out of tune; he is
a bad speaker, because of his stutter. For weeks he occupied himself in
the asylum with peculiar jumping, and contortions of the body which he
called gymnastics, he sang and declaimed. Then he became more quiet and
dreamy, often stared thoughtfully in front of him for a long time, now
and then sang a love song which, despite its want of musical expression,
betrayed a pretty feeling for love's aspirations. This also was in
complete contrast with the dryness and isolation of his normal life. He
gradually became accessible for lengthy conversations.

We will break off the history of the disease here, and sum up what is
furnished so far by observation of the patient.

In the first illness the delirium broke out unexpectedly, and was
followed by a mental disorder with confused ideas and violence which
lasted for several weeks. Complete recovery appeared to have taken
place. Six years later there was a sudden outbreak of mania, grandiose
delusions, bizarre actions, followed by a twilight-stage gradually
leading to recovery. Here we again see a typical case of dementia
præcox, of the katatonic variety, especially characterised by peculiar
movements and actions. In psychiatry the views obtaining at present
would regard this as localised cellular disease of some part of the
cortex, exhibiting confusional states, delusions of grandeur, peculiar
contortions of the muscles, or twilight-states, which taken all together
have as little psychological meaning as the bizarre shapes of a drop of
lead thrown into water.

This is not my view. It was certainly no accidental freak of the
brain-cells that created the dramatic contrasts shown in the second
illness. We can see that these contrasts, the so-called grandiose
delusions, were very subtly determined by the deficiencies in the
patient's personality. Without doubt, any one of us would naturally
regard these deficiencies seriously in ourselves. Who would not have
the desire to find compensation for the aridness of his profession and
of his life in the joys of poetry and music and to restore to his body
the natural power and beauty stolen from it by the study's atmosphere?
Do we not recall with envy the energy of a Demosthenes who, despite his
stammering, became a great orator? If our patient thus fulfilled the
obvious gaps in his physical and mental life by delusional wishes, the
supposition is warranted that the whispered love-song which he sang from
time to time filled up a painful blank in his being, which became more
painful the more it was concealed. The explanation is not far to seek.
It is simply the old story, born anew in every human soul, in a guise
befitting the destined creature's highest sensibilities.

When our patient was a student he learnt to know and love a
girl-student. Together they made many excursions in the environs of
the town, but his exceeding timidity and bashfulness (the lot of the
stammerer) never permitted him an opportunity of getting out the
appropriate words. Moreover, he was poor and had nothing to offer her
but hopes. The time came for the termination of his studies; she went
away, and he also, and they never saw one another again. And not long
afterwards he heard she had married some one else. Then he relinquished
his hopes, but he did not know that Eros never emancipates his slaves.

He buried himself in abstract learning, not to forget, but to work for
her in his thoughts. He wanted to keep the love in his heart quite
secret, and never to betray that secret. He would dedicate his works to
her without her ever knowing it. The compromise succeeded, but not for
long. Once he travelled through the town where he heard she lived--it
seems to have been an accident that he travelled through that town.
He did not leave the train, which only made a short halt there. From
the window he saw standing in the distance a young woman with a little
child, and thought it was she. Impossible to say whether it was really
so or not. He does not think he felt any peculiar feeling at that
moment; anyway he gave himself no trouble to ascertain whether it was
she, which makes the presumption strong that it was not really she.
The unconscious wanted to be left in peace with its illusion. Shortly
afterwards he again came to B----, the place of old memories. Then he
felt something strange stir in his soul, an uneasy feeling, akin to
Nietzsche's--

    "Not for long shalt thou thirst, O burning heart!
    There is promise in the air,
    Winds come to me from unknown mouths--
    The healing coolness comes."

Civilised man no longer believes in demons, he calls in the doctor. Our
patient wanted to be hypnotised. Then madness overcame him. What was
going on in him?

He answered this question in broken sentences, with long pauses, in that
twilight-stage that heralds convalescence. I give as faithfully as may
be his own words. When he fell ill he suddenly lost the well-regulated
world and found himself in the chaos of an overmastering dream, a sea of
blood and fire; the world was out of joint; everywhere conflagration,
volcanic outbreaks, earthquakes, mountains fell in, followed by enormous
battles where the peoples fell upon one another; he became involved more
and more in the battle of nature, he was right in the midst of those
fighting, wrestling, defending himself, enduring unutterable misery and
pain; gradually he was exalted and strengthened by a strange calming
feeling that some one was watching his struggles, that his loved one saw
all from afar. That was the time when he showed real violence to the
attendants. He felt his strength increasing and saw himself at the head
of great armies which he would lead to victory. Then more great battles
and at length victory. He would try to get his loved one as prize of
victory. As he drew near her the illness ceased, and he awoke from a
long dream.

His daily life again began to follow the regular routine. He shut
himself up in his work and forgot the abyss within himself. A few years
later he is again at B---- Demon or Destiny? Again he followed the
old trail and again was overborne by old memories. But this time he
was not immersed in the depths of confusion. He remained orientated
and _en rapport_ with his surroundings. The struggle was considerably
milder, but he did gymnastics, practised the arts, and made good his
deficiencies; then followed the dreamy stage with the love-songs,
corresponding to the period of victory in the first psychosis. In this
state, according to his own words, he had a dreamlike feeling as if he
stood upon the borders of two worlds and knew not whether truth stood on
the right or on the left. He told me, "It is said she is married, but I
believe she is not, but is still waiting for me; I feel that it must be
so. It is ever to me as if she were not married, and as if success were
yet attainable."

Our patient here portrayed but a pale copy of the scene in the first
attack of psychosis, when he, the victor, stood before his mistress.
In the course of a few weeks after this conversation the scientific
interests of the patient again began to predominate. He spoke with
obvious unwillingness about his intimate life, he repressed it more
and more, and finally turned away from it as if it did not belong to
himself. Thus gradually the gate of the under-world became closed.
There remained nothing but a certain tense expression, and a look
which, though fixed on the outer world, was turned inwards at the same
time; and this alone hinted at the silent activity of the unconscious,
preparing new solutions for his insoluble problem. This is the so-called
cure in dementia præcox.

Hitherto we psychiatrists used not to be able to suppress a laugh when
we read an artist's attempts to portray a psychosis. These attempts have
been generally regarded as quite useless, for the writer introduces
into his conception of the psychosis psychological relationships quite
foreign to the clinical picture of the disease. But the artist has not
simply proceeded to copy a case out of a psychiatric text-book; he knows
as a rule better than the psychiatrist.

The case which I have sketched is not unique, it is typical of a whole
class for which the artist Spitteler has created a model of universal
validity; the model is _Imago_. I may take for granted that you know his
book of that name. The psychological gulf, however, between the creation
of the artist and the insane person is great. The world of the artist
is one of solved problems; the world of reality, that of unsolved
problems. The mental patient is a faithful image of this reality. His
solutions are unsatisfying illusions, his cure a temporary giving up of
the problem, which yet goes on working in the depths of the unconscious,
and at the appointed time again rises to the surface and creates new
illusions with new scenery; part of the history of mankind is here seen
abridged.

Psychological analysis is far from being able to explain in complete and
illuminating fashion all cases of the disease with which we are here
concerned. On the contrary, the majority remain obscure and difficult to
understand, and chiefly because only a certain proportion of patients
recover. Our last patient is noteworthy because his return to a normal
state afforded us a survey of the period of his illness. Unfortunately
the advantage of this standpoint is not always possible to us, for a
great number of persons never find their way back from their dreams.
They are lost in the maze of a magic garden where the same old story
is repeated again and again in a timeless present. For patients the
hands of the clock of the world remain stationary; there is no time, no
further development. It makes no difference to them whether they dream
for two days or thirty years. I had a patient in my ward who was five
years without uttering a word, in bed, and entirely buried in himself.
For years I visited him twice daily, and as I reached his bedside I
could see at once that there was no change. One day I was just about to
leave the room when a voice I did not recognise called out--"Who are
you? What do you want here?" I saw with astonishment that it was the
dumb patient who had suddenly regained his voice, and obviously his
senses also. I told him I was his doctor, whereupon he asked angrily,
why was he kept a prisoner here, and why did no one ever speak to him?
He said this in an injured voice just like a normal person whom one had
neglected for a couple of days. I informed him that he had been in bed
quite speechless for five years and had responded to nothing, whereat
he looked at me fixedly and without understanding. Naturally I tried
to discover what had gone on in him during these five years, but could
learn nothing. Another patient with a similar symptom, when asked why
he had remained silent for years, maintained, "Because I wanted to
spare the German language."[199] These examples show that it is often
impossible to lift the veil of the secret, for the patients themselves
have neither interest nor pleasure in explaining their strange
experiences, in which as a rule they realise nothing peculiar.

Occasionally the symptoms themselves are a sign-post to the
understanding of the psychology of the disease.

We had a patient who was for thirty-five years an inmate at Burghölzli.
For decades she lay in bed, she never spoke or reacted to anything, her
head was always bowed, her back bent and the knees somewhat drawn up.
She was always making peculiar rubbing movements with her hands, so as
to give rise during the course of years to thick horny patches on her
hands. She kept the thumb and index finger of her right hand together
as in the movement of sewing. When she died I tried to discover what
she had been formerly. Nobody in the asylum recalled ever having seen
her out of bed. Only our chief attendant had a memory of having seen
her sitting in the same attitude as that she afterwards took up in bed,
at which time she was making rapid movements of extension of the arm
across the right knee; it was said of her that she was sewing shoes,
later that she was polishing shoes. As time went on the movements became
more limited till finally there remained but a slight rubbing movement,
and only the finger and thumb retained the sewing position. In vain
I consulted our old attendant, she knew nothing about the patient's
previous history. When the seventy-year-old brother came to the funeral
I asked him what had been the cause of his sister's illness; he told
me that she had had a love-affair, but for various reasons it had
come to nothing. The girl had taken this so to heart that she became
low-spirited. In answer to a query about her lover it was found that he
was a _shoemaker_.

Unless you see here some strange play of accident, you must agree that
the patient had kept the memory-picture of her lover unaltered in her
heart for thirty-five years.

One might easily think that these patients who give an impression of
imbecility are only burnt-out ruins of humanity. But such is probably
not the case. One can often prove directly that such patients register
everything going on around them even with a certain curiosity, and have
an excellent memory for it all. This is the reason why many patients
become for a time pretty sensible again, and develop mental powers which
one believed they had long since lost. Such intervals occur occasionally
during serious physical disease, or just before death. We had a patient
with whom it was impossible to carry on a sane conversation; he only
produced a mad medley of delusions and words. He once fell seriously
ill physically, and I expected it would be very difficult to treat him.
Not at all. He was quite changed, he became friendly and amiable, and
carried out all his doctor's orders patiently and gratefully. His eyes
lost their evil darting looks, and shone quietly and understandingly.
One morning I came to his room with the usual greeting: "Good morning.
How are you getting on?" The patient answered me in the well-known way:
"There again comes one of the dog and monkey troupe wanting to play the
Saviour." Then I knew his physical trouble was over. From that moment
the whole of his reason was as if "blown away" again.

From these observations we see that reason still survives, but is pushed
away into some corner by the complete preoccupation of the mind with
diseased thoughts.

Why is the mind compelled to exhaust itself in the elaboration of
diseased nonsense? On this difficult question our new insight throws
considerable light. To-day we can say that the pathological images
dominate the interests of the patient so completely, because they are
simply derivatives of the most important questions that used to occupy
the person when normal--what in insanity is now an incomprehensible
maze of symptoms used to be fields of vital interest to the former
personality.

I will cite as an example a patient who was twenty years in the asylum.
She was always a puzzle to the physicians, for the absurdity of her
delusions exceeded anything that the boldest imagination could create.

She was a dressmaker by trade, born in 1845, of very poor family.
Her sister early went wrong and was finally lost in the swamp of
prostitution. The patient herself led an industrious, respectable,
reserved life. She fell ill in 1886 in her 39th year--at the threshold
of the age when so many a dream is brought to naught. Her illness
consisted in delusions and hallucinations which increased rapidly,
and soon became so absurd that no one could understand her wishes and
complaints. In 1887 she came to the asylum. In 1888 her statements,
so far as the delusions were concerned, were not intelligible. She
maintained such monstrous things as that: "At night her spinal marrow
had been torn out; pains in the back had been caused by substances that
went through the walls and were covered with magnetism." "The monopoly
fixed the sorrows which are not in the body and do not fly about in the
air." "Excursions are made by breathing in chemistry, and by suffocation
regions are destroyed."

In 1892 the patient styled herself the "Bank Note Monopoly, Queen of the
Orphans, Proprietress of the Burghölzli Asylum;" she said: "Naples and I
must provide the world with macaroni" (Nudel).

In 1896 she became "Germania and Helvetia from exclusively pure butter";
she also said, "I am Noah's Ark, the boat of salvation and respect."

Since then the disease has greatly increased; her last creation is the
delusion that she is the "lily red sea monster and the blue one."

These instances will show you how far the incomprehensibility of such
pathological formations go. Our patient was for years the classic
example of meaningless delusional ideas in dementia præcox; and many
hundreds of medical students have received from the demonstration of
this case a permanent impression of the sinister power of insanity. But
even this case has not withstood the newer technique of psychoanalysis.
What the patient says is not at all meaningless; it is full of
significance, so that he who has the key can understand without overmuch
difficulty.

Time does not allow me to describe the technique by means of which I
succeeded in lifting the veil of her secret. I must content myself by
giving a few examples to make the strange changes of thought and of
speech in this patient clear to you.

She said of herself that _she was Socrates_. The analysis of this
delusion presented the following ideas: Socrates was the wisest man,
the man of greatest learning; he was infamously accused, and had to die
in prison at the hands of strange men. She was the best dressmaker, but
"never unnecessarily cut a thread, and never allowed a piece of material
to lie about on the floor." She worked ceaselessly, and now she has been
falsely accused, wicked men have shut her up, and she will have to die
in the asylum.

Therefore she is Socrates; this is, as you see, simple metaphor, based
upon obvious analogy. Take another example: "_I am the finest professor
and the finest artist in the world._"

The analysis furnishes the remarks that she is the best dressmaker and
chooses the most beautiful models which show up well and waste little
material; she puts on the trimming only where it can be seen. She is a
professor, and an artist in her work. She makes the best clothes and
calls them absurdly "The Schnecke Museum-clothes." Her customers are
only such persons as frequent the Schnecke House and the Museum (the
Schnecke House is the aristocratic club. It is near the Museum and the
Library, another rendezvous of the aristocratic set of Zürich), for she
is the best dressmaker and makes only Schnecke Museum[200] clothing.

The patient also _calls herself Mary Stuart_. Analysis showed the same
analogy as with Socrates: innocent suffering and death of a heroine.

"_I am the Lorelei._" Analysis: This is an old and well-known song: "I
know not what it means," etc. Whenever she wants to speak about her
affairs people do not understand her, and say they don't know what it
means; hence she is the Lorelei.

"_I am Switzerland._" Analysis: Switzerland is free, no one can rob
Switzerland of her freedom. The patient does not belong to the asylum,
she would be free like Switzerland, hence she is Switzerland.

"_I am a crane._" Analysis: In the "Cranes of Ibykus" it is said:
"Whosoever is free of sin and fault shall preserve the pure soul of
a child." She has been brought innocent to the asylum and has never
committed a crime--hence she is a crane.

"_I am Schiller's Bell._" Analysis: Schiller's Bell is the greatest work
of the great master. She is the best and most industrious dressmaker,
and has achieved the highest rung in the art of dressmaking--hence she
is Schiller's Bell.

"_I am Hufeland._" Analysis: Hufeland was the best doctor. She suffers
intolerably in the asylum and is moreover treated by the worst doctors.
She is, however, so prominent a personality that she had a claim to the
best doctors, that is to a doctor like Hufeland--hence she is Hufeland.

The patient used the expression "I am" in a very arbitrary way.
Sometimes it meant "it belongs to me" or "it is proper for me";
sometimes it means "I should have." This is seen from the following
analysis:

"_I am the master-key._" Analysis: The master-key is the key that opens
all the doors of the asylum. Properly, according to all rights, the
patient should long since have obtained this key for she has been for
many years "the proprietress of the Burghölzli Asylum." She expresses
this reflection very much simplified in the sentence, "I am the
master-key."

The chief content of her delusions is concentrated in the following
words:--

"_I am the monopoly._" Analysis: The patient means the banknote
monopoly, which has belonged to her for some time. She believes that
she possesses the monopoly of the entire bank notes of the world, thus
creating enormous riches for herself, in compensation for the poverty
and lowliness of her lot. Her parents died early; hence she is the
Queen of the Orphans. Her parents lived and died in great poverty. Her
blessings are extended to them also, the dreamlike delusions of the
patient benefit them in many ways. She says textually: "My parents are
clothed by me, my sorely-tried mother, full of sorrow--I sat with her at
table--covered in white with superfluity."

This is another of these malleable hallucinations which the patient had
daily. It is one of those scenes of wish-fulfilment, with poverty on
one side and riches on the other, recalling Hauptmann's Hannele; more
especially that scene where Gottwald says: "She was clothed in rags--now
she is bedeckt in silken robes; and she ran about barefoot--now she has
shoes of glass to her feet. Soon she will live in a golden castle and
eat each day of baked meats. Here has she lived on cold potatoes...."

The wish-fulfilments of our patient go even further. Switzerland has
to furnish her with an income of 150,000 francs. The Director of the
Burghölzli owes her 80,000 francs damages for wrongful incarceration.
She is the proprietress of a distant island with silver mines, the
"mightiest silver island in the world." Therefore she is also the
greatest orator, possesses the most wonderful eloquence, for, as she
says, "Speech is _silver_, silence gold." To her all the beautiful
landed estates belong--all the rich quarters, towns and lands, she
is the proprietress of a world, even a "threefold proprietress of
the world." Whilst poor Hannele was only elevated to the side of the
Heavenly Bridegroom, our patient has the "Key of Heaven," she is not
only the honoured earthly queens Mary Stuart and Queen Louise of
Prussia, but she is also the Queen of Heaven, the Mother of God as well
as the Godhead. Even in this earthly world where she was but a poor,
ill-regarded homely dressmaker she attained fulfilments of her human
wishes, for she had taken three husbands from the best families in
the town and her fourth was the Emperor Francis. From these marriages
there were two phantom children--a little boy and a little girl. Just
as she clothed, fed and feasted her parents, so she provided for the
future of her children. To her son she bequeathed the great bazaar of
Zürich, therefore her son is a "Zur," for the proprietor of a _Bazaar_
is a "Zur." The daughter resembles her mother; hence she becomes the
proprietress of the asylum and takes her mother's place so that the
mother is released from captivity. The daughter therefore receives the
title of "Agency of Socrates," for she replaces Socrates in captivity.

These instances by no means exhaust the delusional fancies of the
patient. But they will give you some idea, I hope, of the richness
of her inner life although she was apparently so dull and apathetic,
or, as was said _imbecile_, and sat for twenty years in her workroom,
where she mechanically repaired her linen, occasionally uttering a
complex of meaningless fragments which no one had hitherto been able to
understand. Her odd lack of words can now be seen in another light; they
are fragments of enigmatical inscriptions, of fairy-story phantasies,
which have escaped from the hard world to found a world of their own.
Here the tables are ever laden, and a thousand feasts are celebrated in
golden palaces. The patient can only spare a few mysterious symbols for
the gloomy dim shores of reality; they need not be understood, for our
understanding has not been necessary for her for this long time.

Nor is this patient at all unique. She is one of a type. Similar
phantasies are always found in patients of this kind, though not always
in such profusion.

The parallels with Hauptmann's Hannele show that here likewise the
artist has shown us the way with the free creation of his own phantasy.
From this coincidence, which is not accidental, we may conclude that
there is something common both to the artist and the insane and not to
them alone. Every human being has also within himself that restless
creative phantasy which is ever engaged in assuaging the harshness
of reality. Whoever gives himself unsparingly and carefully to
self-observation, will realise that there dwells within him something
which would gladly hide and cover up all that is difficult and
questionable in life, and thus procure an easy and free path. Insanity
grants the upper hand to this something. When once it is uppermost,
reality is more or less quickly driven out. It becomes a distant dream,
and the dream which enchains the patient wholly or in part, and often
for life, has now the attributes of reality. We normal persons, who have
to do entirely with reality, see only the products of disordered fancy,
but not the wealth of that side of the mind which is turned away from
us. Unfortunately only too often no further knowledge reaches us of the
things which are transpiring on that other side, because all the bridges
are broken down which unite this side with that.

We do not know to-day whether these new views are of universal or only
of limited validity; the more carefully and perseveringly we examine our
patients, the more we shall meet cases, which, despite apparent total
imbecility, will yet afford us at least some fragmentary insight into
the obscurities of the psychical life. This life is far removed from
that mental poverty which the prevailing theories were compelled to
accept.

However far we are from being able to understand fully the
concatenations of that obscure world, at least we may maintain, with
complete assurance, that in dementia præcox there is no symptom which
can be described as psychologically baseless and meaningless. The
most absurd things are in reality symbols of ideas which are not
only generally understandable, but also universally operative in the
human heart. In insanity we do not discover anything new and unknown,
but we look at the foundation of our own being, the source of those
life-problems in which we are all engaged.
