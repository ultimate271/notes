# AUTHOR'S PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION
## Preface

This volume contains a selection of articles and pamphlets on analytical
psychology written at intervals during the past fourteen years. These
years have seen the development of a new discipline, and as is usual in
such a case, have involved many changes of view-point, of concept, and
of formulation.

It is not my intention to give a presentation of the fundamental
concepts of analytical psychology in this book; it throws some
light, however, on a certain line of development which is especially
characteristic of the Zürich School of psychoanalysis.

As is well known, the merit of the discovery of the new analytical
method of general psychology belongs to Professor Freud of Vienna. His
original view-points had to undergo many essential modifications, some
of them owing to the work done at Zürich, in spite of the fact that he
himself is far from agreeing with the standpoint of this school.

I am unable to explain fully the fundamental differences between the
two schools, but would indicate the following points: The Vienna School
takes the standpoint of an exclusive sexualistic conception, while
that of the Zürich School is symbolistic. The Vienna School interprets
the psychological symbol semiotically, as a sign or token of certain
primitive psychosexual processes. Its method is analytical and causal.

The Zürich School recognises the scientific feasibility of such a
conception, but denies its exclusive validity, for it does not interpret
the psychological symbol semiotically only, but also symbolistically,
that is, it attributes a positive value to the symbol.

The value does not depend merely on historical causes; its chief
importance lies in the fact that it has a meaning for the actual
present, and for the future, in their psychological aspects. For to the
Zürich School the symbol is not merely a sign of something repressed and
concealed, but is at the same time an attempt to comprehend and to point
out the way of the further psychological development of the individual.
Thus we add a prospective import to the retrospective value of the
symbol.

The method of the Zürich School is therefore not only analytical and
causal, but also synthetic and prospective, in recognition that the
human mind is characterised by "causæ" and also by "fines" (aims). The
latter fact needs particular emphasis, because there are two types of
psychology, the one following the principle of hedonism, and the other
following the principle of power. Scientific materialism is pertinent
to the former type, and the philosophy of Nietzsche to the latter. The
principle of the Freudian theory is hedonism, while that of Adler (one
of Freud's earliest personal pupils) is founded upon the principle of
power.

The Zürich School, recognising the existence of these two types (also
remarked by the late Professor William James), considers that the views
of Freud and Adler are one-sided, and only valid within the limits of
their corresponding type. Both principles exist within every individual,
but not in equal proportions.

Thus, it is obvious that each psychological symbol has two aspects, and
should be interpreted according to the two principles. Freud and Adler
interpret in the analytical and causal way, reducing to the infantile
and primitive. Thus with Freud the conception of the "aim" is the
fulfilment of desire, with Adler it is the usurpation of power. Both
authors take the standpoint in their practical analytical work which
brings to view only infantile and gross egoistic aims.

The Zürich School is convinced of the fact that within the limits of
a diseased mental attitude the psychology is such as Freud and Adler
describe. It is, indeed, just on account of such impossible and childish
psychology that the individual is in a state of inward dissociation and
hence neurotic. The Zürich School, therefore, in agreement with them so
far, also reduces the psychological symbol (the phantasy products of
the patient) to the fundamental infantile hedonism, or to the infantile
desire for power. But Freud and Adler content themselves with the
result of mere reduction, according to their scientific biologism and
naturalism.

But here a very important question arises. Can man obey the fundamental
and primitive impulses of his nature without gravely injuring himself
or his fellow beings? He cannot assert either his sexual desire or
his desire for power unlimitedly, and the limits are moreover very
restricted. The Zürich School has in view also the final result
of analysis, and regards the fundamental thoughts and impulses
of the unconscious, as symbols, indicative of a definite line of
future development. We must admit there is, however, _no scientific
justification_ for such a procedure, because our present-day science is
based as a whole upon causality. But causality is only one principle,
and psychology essentially cannot be exhausted by causal methods
only, because the mind lives by aims as well. Besides this disputable
philosophical argument, we have another of much greater value in favour
of our hypothesis, namely, that of _vital necessity_. It is impossible
to live according to the intimations of infantile hedonism, or according
to a childish desire for power. If these are to be retained they must be
taken symbolically. Out of the symbolic application of infantile trends,
an attitude evolves which may be termed philosophic or religious, and
these terms characterise sufficiently the lines of further development
of the individual. The individual is not only an established and
unchangeable complex of psychological facts, but also an extremely
changeable entity. By exclusive reduction to causes, the primitive
trends of a personality are reinforced; this is only helpful when at
the same time these primitive tendencies are balanced by recognition
of their symbolic value. Analysis and reduction lead to causal truth;
this by itself does not help living, but brings about resignation and
hopelessness. On the other hand, the recognition of the intrinsic value
of a symbol leads to constructive truth and helps us to live. It induces
hopefulness and furthers the possibility of future development.

The functional importance of the symbol is clearly shown in the history
of civilisation. For thousands of years the religious symbol proved
a most efficacious means in the moral education of mankind. Only a
prejudiced mind could deny such an obvious fact. Concrete values cannot
take the place of the symbol; only new and more efficient symbols can
be substituted for those that are antiquated and outworn, such as have
lost their efficacy through the progress of intellectual analysis and
understanding. The further development of mankind can only be brought
about by means of symbols which represent something far in advance of
himself, and whose intellectual meanings cannot yet be grasped entirely.
The individual unconscious produces such symbols, and they are of the
greatest possible value in the moral development of the personality.

Man almost invariably has philosophic and religious views of the meaning
of the world and of his own life. There are some who are proud to have
none. These are exceptions outside the common path of mankind; they miss
an important function which has proved itself to be indispensable to the
human mind.

In such cases we find in the unconscious, instead of modern
symbolism, an antiquated archaic view of the world and of life. If a
requisite psychological function is not represented in the sphere of
consciousness, it exists in the unconscious in the form of an archaic or
embryonic prototype.

This brief _résumé_ may show what the reader cannot find in this
collection of papers. The essays are stations on the way of the more
general views developed above.
