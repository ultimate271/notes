# EDITOR'S PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION
## Preface


The following papers have been gathered together from various sources,
and are now available for the first time to English readers. The subject
of psychoanalysis is much in evidence, and is likely to occupy still
more attention in the near future, as the psychological content of the
psychoses and neuroses is more generally appreciated and understood.
It is of importance, therefore, that the fundamental writings of both
the Viennese and Zürich Schools should be accessible for study. Several
of Freud's works have already been translated into English. Dr. Jung's
"Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido" was published in America in 1916
under the title of "The Psychology of the Unconscious." That work, read
in conjunction with these papers, offers a fairly complete picture of
the scientific and philosophic standpoint of the leader of the Zürich
School. It is the task of the future to judge and expand the findings
of both schools, and to work at the development of the new psychology,
which is still in its infancy.

It will be a relief to many students of the unconscious to see it in
another aspect than that of "a wild beast couched, waiting its hour to
spring." Some readers have gathered that view of it from the writings
of the Viennese School, a view which is at most that dangerous thing "a
half-truth."

In the papers appearing for the first time in this edition (Chapters
XIV. and XV.), Dr. Jung develops his ideas of introversion and
extroversion, a contribution of the first importance to psychology.
He agrees with Freud in regarding the neuroses to be the result of
repression, but differs in his view as to the origin of repression.
He finds this to lie not in sexuality _per se_, but rather in man's
natural tendency to adapt to the demands of life one-sidedly, according
to his type of mentality. The born extrovert adapts by means of
feeling, thought being under repression and relatively infantile. The
introvert's natural adaptation is by means of thought; feeling being
more or less repressed remains undeveloped. In either type the neglected
co-function is behind the adapted function. This inequality operating
in the unconscious, brings about a conflict, which in certain subjects
amounts to a neurosis, and in others produces a limitation of individual
development. This view shifts the interpretation of repression on to a
much more comprehensive basis than that of sexuality, although there can
scarcely be a repression that does not include this instinct on account
of its deep and far-reaching importance in man.

There is no doubt that some even scientific persons have a certain
fear of whither the study of the unconscious may lead. These fearful
persons should be reminded that they possess an unconscious in spite of
themselves, and that they share it in common with every human being. It
is an extension of the individual. To study it is to deepen the self.
All new discoveries have at one stage been called dangerous, and all new
philosophies have been deemed heresies. It is as though we would once
more consign radium to its dust-heaps, lest some day the new radiancy
should over-power mankind. Indeed this particular thing has proved
at once most dangerous and most precious. Man must learn to use his
treasure, and in using it to _submit to its own laws_, which can only
become known when it is handled and investigated.

Those who read this book with the attention it requires, will find they
gain an impression of many new truths. The second edition is issued
towards the end of the third year of the Great European war, at a time
when much we have valued and held sacred is in the melting-pot. But
we believe that out of the crucible new forms will arise. The study
of psychoanalysis produces something of the effect of a war in the
psyche; indeed, we need to make conscious this war in the inner things
of the mind and soul if we would be delivered in the future from war
in the external world. There is a parallelism between individual and
international neurosis. In the pain of the upheaval, one recognises the
birth-pangs of newer, and let us hope, truer thought, and more natural
adaptations. We need a renewal of our philosophy of life to replace much
that has perished in the general cataclysm, and it is because I see in
the analytical psychology, which grows out of a scientific study of the
unconscious, the germs of such a new construction, that I have gathered
the following essays together. The translation is the work of various
hands, the names of the different translators being given in a footnote
at the beginning of each essay; for the editing I am responsible. The
essays are, as far as possible, printed in chronological order, and
those readers who are sufficiently interested will be able to discern
in them the gradual development of Dr. Jung's present position in
psychoanalysis.
