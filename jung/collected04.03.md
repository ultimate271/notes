## DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOMNAMBULIC PERSONALITIES.

At the beginning of many séances the glass was allowed to move by
itself, when occasionally the advice followed in stereotyped fashion:
"You must ask."

Since convinced spiritualists took part in the séances, all kinds
of spiritualistic wonders were of course demanded, and especially
the "protecting spirits." In reply, sometimes names of well-known
dead people were produced, sometimes unknown names, _e.g._ Berthe
de Valours, Elizabeth von Thierfelsenburg, Ulrich von Gerbenstein,
etc. The controlling spirit was almost without exception the medium's
grandfather, who once explained: "he loved her more than any one in
this world because he had protected her from childhood up, and knew
all her thoughts." This personality produced a flood of Biblical
maxims, edifying observations, and song-book verses; the following is a
specimen:--

                In true believing,
    To faith in God cling ever nigh,
    Thy heavenly comfort never leaving,
    Which having, man can never die.
    Refuge in God is peace for ever,
    When earthly cares oppress the mind;
    Who from the heart can pray is never
    Bowed down by fate, howe'er unkind.

Numerous similar elaborations betrayed by their banal, unctuous
contents their origin in some tract or other. When S. W. had to speak
in ecstasy, lively dialogues developed between the circle-members and
the somnambulic personality. The content of the answers received is
essentially just the same commonplace edifying stuff as that of the
psychographic communications. The character of this personality is
distinguished by its dry and tedious solemnity, rigorous conventionality
and pietistic virtue (which is not consistent with the historic
reality). The grandfather is the medium's guide and protector. During
the ecstatic state he gives all kinds of advice, prophesies later
attacks and the visions she will see on waking, etc. He orders cold
bandages, gives directions concerning the medium's lying down or the
date of the séances. His relationship to the medium is an extremely
tender one. In liveliest contrast to this heavy dream-person stands
a personality, appearing first sporadically, in the psychographic
communications of the first séance. It soon disclosed itself as the
dead brother of a Mr. R., who was then taking part in the séance. This
dead brother, Mr. P. R., was full of commonplaces about brotherly love
towards his living brother. He evaded particular questions in all
manner of ways. But he developed a quite astonishing eloquence towards
the ladies of the circle and in particular offered his allegiance to
one whom Mr. P. R. had never known when alive. He affirmed that he
had already cared very much for her in his lifetime, had often met
her in the street without knowing who she was, and was now uncommonly
delighted to become acquainted with her in this unusual manner. With
such insipid compliments, scornful remarks to the men, harmless childish
jokes, etc., he took up a large part of the séance. Several of the
members found fault with the frivolity and banality of this "spirit,"
whereupon he disappeared for one or two séances, but soon reappeared,
at first well-behaved, often indeed uttering Christian maxims, but
soon dropping back into the old tone. Besides these two sharply
differentiated personalities, others appeared who varied but little from
the grandfather's type; they were mostly dead relatives of the medium.
The general atmosphere of the first two months' séances was accordingly
solemnly edifying, disturbed only from time to time by Mr. P. R.'s
trivial chatter. Some weeks after the beginning of the séances, Mr. R.
left our circle, whereupon a remarkable change took place in Mr. P.
R.'s conversation. He became monosyllabic, came less often, and after a
few séances vanished altogether, later on he reappeared but with great
infrequency, and for the most part only when the medium was alone with
the particular lady mentioned. Then a new personality forced himself
into the foreground; in contrast to Mr. P. R., who always spoke the
Swiss dialect, this gentleman adopted an affected North-German way of
speaking. In all else he was an exact copy of Mr. P. R. His eloquence
was somewhat remarkable, since S. W. had only a very scanty knowledge of
high German, whilst this new personality, who called himself Ulrich von
Gerbenstein, spoke an almost faultless German, rich in charming phrases
and compliments.[20]

Ulrich von Gerbenstein was a witty chatterer, full of repartee, an
idler, a great admirer of the ladies, frivolous, and most superficial.

During the winter of 1899-1900 he gradually came to dominate
the situation more and more, and took over one by one all the
above-mentioned functions of the grandfather, so that under his
influence the serious character of the séances disappeared.

All suggestions to the contrary proved unavailing, and at last the
séances had on this account to be suspended for longer and longer
intervals. There is a peculiarity common to all these somnambulic
personalities which must be noted. They have access to the medium's
memory, even to the unconscious portion, they are also _au courant_ with
the visions which she has in the ecstatic state, but they have only
_the most superficial knowledge of her phantasies during the ecstasy_.
Of the somnambulic dreams they know only what they occasionally pick
up from the members of the circle. On doubtful points they can give no
information, or only such as contradicts the medium's explanations. The
stereotyped answer to these questions runs: "Ask Ivenes."[21] "Ivenes
knows." From the examples given of different ecstatic moments it is
clear that the medium's consciousness is by no means idle during the
trance, but develops a striking and multiplex phantastic activity.
For the reconstruction of S. W.'s somnambulic self we have to depend
altogether upon her several statements; for in the first place her
spontaneous utterances connecting her with the waking self are few,
and often irrelevant, and in the second very many of these ecstatic
states go by without gesture, and without speech, so that no conclusions
as to the inner happenings can afterwards be drawn from the external
appearances. _S. W. is almost totally amnesic for the automatic
phenomena during ecstasy as far as they come within the territory of
the new personalities of her ego. Of all the other phenomena, such as
loud talking, babbling, etc., which are directly connected with her own
ego she usually has a clear remembrance._ But in every case there is
complete amnesia only during the first few minutes after the ecstasy.
Within the first half-hour, during which there usually prevails a kind
of semi-somnambulism with a dreamlike manner, hallucinations, etc., the
amnesia gradually disappears, whilst fragmentary memories emerge of what
has occurred, but in a quite irregular and arbitrary fashion.

The later séances were usually begun by our hands being joined and laid
on the table, whereon the table at once began to move. Meanwhile S. W.
gradually became somnambulic, took her hands from the table, lay back
on the sofa, and fell into the ecstatic sleep. She sometimes related
her experiences to us afterwards, but showed herself very reticent if
strangers were present. After the very first ecstasy she indicated
that she played a distinguished _rôle_ among the spirits. She had
a special name, as had each of the spirits; hers was _Ivenes_; her
grandfather looked after her with particular care. In the ecstasy with
the flower-vision we learnt her special secret, hidden till then beneath
the deepest silence. During the séances in which her spirit spoke she
made long journeys, mostly to relatives, to whom she said she appeared,
or she found herself on the Other Side, in "That space between the
stars which people think is empty, but in which there are really very
many spirit-worlds." In the semi-somnambulic state which frequently
followed her attacks, she once described, in peculiar poetic fashion,
a landscape on the Other Side, "a wondrous, moon-lit valley, set aside
for the races not yet born." She represented her somnambulic ego as
being almost completely released from the body. It is a fully-grown but
small, black-haired woman, of pronounced Jewish type, clothed in white
garments, her head covered with a turban. She understands and speaks the
language of the spirits, "for spirits still, from old human custom, do
speak to one another, although they do not really need to, since they
mutually understand one another's thoughts." She "does not really always
talk with the spirits, but just looks at them, and so understands their
thoughts." She travels in the company of four or five spirits, dead
relatives, and visits her living relatives and acquaintances in order
to investigate their life and their way of thinking; she further visits
all places which lie within the radius of these spectral inhabitants.
From her acquaintanceship with Kerner's book, she discovered and
improved upon the ideas of the black spirits who are kept enchanted in
certain places, or exist partly beneath the earth's surface (compare
the "Seherin von Prevorst"). This activity caused her much trouble and
pain; in and after the ecstasy she complained of suffocating feelings,
violent headache, etc. But every fortnight, on Wednesdays, she could
pass the whole night in the garden on the Other Side in the company of
holy spirits. There she was taught everything concerning the forces
of the world, the endless complicated relationships and affinities of
human beings, and all besides about the laws of reincarnation, the
inhabitants of the stars, etc. Unfortunately only the system of the
world-forces and reincarnation achieved any expression. As to the other
matters she only let fall disconnected observations. For example, once
she returned from a railway journey in an extremely disturbed state. It
was thought at first something unpleasant had happened, till she managed
to compose herself, and said, "A star-inhabitant had sat opposite to
her in the train." From the description which she gave of this being,
I recognised a well-known elderly merchant I happened to know, who has
a rather unsympathetic face. In connection with this experience she
related all kinds of peculiarities of these star-dwellers; they have no
god-like souls, as men have, they pursue no science, no philosophy, but
in technical arts they are far more advanced than men. Thus on Mars a
flying-machine has long been in existence; the whole of Mars is covered
with canals, these canals are cleverly excavated lakes and serve for
irrigation. The canals are quite superficial; the water in them is very
shallow. The excavating caused the inhabitants of Mars no particular
trouble, for the soil there is lighter than the earth's. The canals are
nowhere bridged, but that does not prevent communication, for everything
travels by flying-machine. Wars no longer occur on the stars, for no
differences of opinion exist. The star-dwellers have not human bodies,
but the most laughable ones possible, such as one would never imagine.
Human spirits who are allowed to travel on the Other Side may not set
foot on the stars. Equally, wandering star-dwellers may not come to the
earth, but must remain at a distance of twenty-five metres above the
earth's surface. Should they transgress they remain in the power of the
earth, and must assume human bodies, and are only set free again after
their natural death. As men, they are cold, hard-hearted, cruel. S. W.
recognises them by a singular expression in which the "Spiritual" is
lacking, and by their hairless, eyebrowless, sharply-cut faces. Napoleon
was a star-dweller.

In her journeys she does not see the places through which she hastens.
She has a feeling of floating, and the spirits tell her when she is
at the right spot. Then, as a rule, she only sees the face and upper
part of the person to whom she is supposed to appear, or whom she
wishes to see. She can seldom say in what kind of surroundings she sees
this person. Occasionally she saw me, but only my head without any
surroundings. She occupied herself much with the enchanting of spirits,
and for this purpose she wrote oracular sayings in a foreign tongue,
on slips of paper which she concealed in all sorts of queer places. An
Italian murderer, presumably living in my house, and whom she called
Conventi, was specially displeasing to her. She tried several times
to cast a spell upon him, and without my knowledge hid several papers
about, on which messages were written; these were later found by chance.
One such, written in red ink, was as follows:

    -------------------               ------------------
    | Conventi        |               |  Conventi, go  |
    | Marche. 4 govi  |               |  orden, Astaf  |
    |         Ivenes. |               |     vent.      |
    -------------------               ------------------

                -------------------------------
                |    Gen palus, vent allis    |
                | ton prost afta ben genallis.|
                -------------------------------

Unfortunately, I never obtained any interpretation of this. S. W.
was quite inaccessible in this matter. Occasionally the somnambulic
Ivenes speaks directly to the public. She does so in dignified fashion,
rather precociously, but she is not wearisomely unctuous and impossibly
twaddling as are her two guides; she is a serious, mature person, devout
and pious, full of womanly tenderness and great modesty, always yielding
to the judgments of others. This expression of plaintive emotion and
melancholy resignation is peculiar to her. She looks beyond this
world, and unwillingly returns to reality; she bemoans her hard lot,
and her unsympathetic family surroundings. Associated with this there
is something elevated about her; she commands her spirits, despises
the twaddling chatter of Gerbenstein, consoles others, directs those
in distress, warns and protects them from dangers to body and soul.
She is the intermediary for the entire intellectual output of all
manifestations, but she herself ascribes it to the direction of the
spirits. It is Ivenes who entirely controls S. W.'s semi-somnambulic
state.

In semi-somnambulism S. W. gave some of those taking part in the
séances the opportunity to compare her with the "Seherin von Prevorst"
(Prophetess of Prevorst). This suggestion was not without results.
S. W. gave hints of earlier existences which she had already lived
through, and after a few weeks she suddenly disclosed a whole system of
reincarnations, although she had never before mentioned anything of the
kind. Ivenes is a spiritual being who is something more than the spirits
of other human beings. Every human spirit must incorporate himself
twice in the course of the centuries. But Ivenes must incorporate
herself at least once every two hundred years; besides herself only two
other persons have participated in this fate, namely, Swedenborg and
Miss Florence Cook (Crookes's famous medium). S. W. calls these two
personages her brother and sister. She gave no information about their
pre-existences. In the beginning of the nineteenth century Ivenes was
Frau Hauffe, the Prophetess of Prevorst; at the end of the eighteenth
century, a clergyman's wife in central Germany (locality unknown).
As the latter she was seduced by Goethe and bore him a child. In the
fifteenth century she was a Saxon countess, and had the poetic name of
Thierfelsenburg. Ulrich von Gerbenstein is a relative from that line.
The interval of 300 years, and her adventure with Goethe, must be atoned
for by the sorrows of the Prophetess of Prevorst. In the thirteenth
century she was a noblewoman of Southern France, called de Valours,
and was burnt as a witch. From the thirteenth century to the Christian
persecution under Nero there were numerous reincarnations of which S.
W. could give no detailed account. In the Christian persecution under
Nero she played a martyr's part. Then comes a period of obscurity till
the time of David, when Ivenes was an ordinary Jewess. After her death
she received from Astaf, an angel from a high heaven, the mandate for
her future wonderful career. In all her pre-existences she was a medium
and an intermediary in the intercourse between this side and the other.
Her brothers and sisters are equally old and have the like vocation. In
her various pre-existences she was sometimes married, and in this way
gradually founded a whole system of relationships with whose endless
complicated inter-relations she occupied herself in many ecstasies.
Thus, for example, about the eighth century she was the mother of her
earthly father and, moreover, of her grandfather, and mine. Hence the
striking friendship of these two old gentlemen, otherwise strangers. As
Mme. de Valours she was the present writer's mother. When she was burnt
as a witch the writer took it much to heart, and went into a cloister
at Rouen, wore a grey habit, became Prior, wrote a work on Botany and
died at over eighty years of age. In the refectory of the cloister
there hung a picture of Mme. de Valours, in which she was depicted in
a half-reclining position. (S. W. in the semi-somnambulic state often
took this position on the sofa. It corresponds exactly to that of Mme.
Recamier in David's well-known picture.) A gentleman who often took part
in the séances, who had some slight resemblance to the writer, was also
one of her sons from that period. Around this core of relationship
there grouped themselves, more or less intimately connected, all the
persons in any way related or known to her. One came from the fifteenth
century, another--a cousin--from the eighteenth century, and so on.

From the three great family stocks grew by far the greater part of the
present European peoples. She and her brothers and sisters are descended
from Adam, who arose by materialisation; the other then-existing
families, from whom Cain took his wife, were descended from apes. S. W.
produced from this circle of relationship an extensive family-gossip,
a very flood of romantic stories, piquant adventures, etc. Sometimes
the target of her romances was a lady acquaintance of the writer's who
for some undiscoverable reason was peculiarly antipathetic to her. She
declared that this lady was an incarnation of a celebrated Parisian
poisoner, who had achieved great notoriety in the eighteenth century.
She maintained that this lady still continued her dangerous work, but
in a much more ingenious way than formerly; through the inspiration of
the wicked spirits who accompany her she had discovered a liquid which
when merely exposed to the air attracted tubercle bacilli and formed
a splendid developing medium for them. By means of this liquid, which
she was wont to mix with the food, the lady had brought about the death
of her husband (who had indeed died of tuberculosis); also one of her
lovers, and of her own brother, for the sake of his inheritance. Her
eldest son was an illegitimate child by her lover. As a widow she had
secretly borne to another lover an illegitimate child, and finally she
had had an unnatural relationship with her own brother (who was later
on poisoned). In this way S. W. spun innumerable stories, in which she
believed quite implicitly. The persons of these stories appeared in
the drama of her visions, as did the lady before referred to, going
through the pantomime of making confession and receiving absolution
of sins. Everything interesting occurring in her surroundings was
incorporated in this system of romances, and given an order in the
network of relationships with a more or less exact statement as to
their pre-existences and the spirits influencing them. It fared thus
with all who made S. W.'s acquaintance: they were valued at a second or
first incarnation, according as they possessed a marked or indefinite
character. They were generally described as relatives, and always
exactly in the same definite way. Only subsequently, often several
weeks later, after an ecstasy, there would make its appearance a new
complicated romance which explained the striking relationship through
pre-existences or through illegitimate relations. Persons sympathetic to
S. W. were usually very near relatives. Most of these family romances
were very carefully made up, so that to contradict them was impossible.
They were always worked out with a quite bewildering certainty, and
surprised one by an extremely clever evaluation of certain details which
she had noticed or taken from somewhere. For the most part the romances
had a ghastly character, murder by poison and dagger, seduction and
divorce, forgery of wills, played the chief rôle.
