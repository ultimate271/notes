# AUTHOR'S PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION
## Preface


In agreement with my honoured collaborator, Dr. C. E. Long, I have
made certain additions to the second edition. It should especially be
mentioned that a new chapter upon "The Concept of the Unconscious" has
been added. This is a lecture I gave early in 1916 before the Zürich
Union for Analytical Psychology. It gives a general orientation of a
most important problem in practical analysis, viz. of the relation
of the psychological ego to the psychological non-ego. Chapter XIV.
has been fundamentally altered, and I have used the opportunity to
incorporate an article that should describe the results of more recent
researches. In accordance with my usual mode of working, the description
is as generalised as possible. My habit in my daily practical work is
to confine myself for some time to studying my human material. I then
abstract as generalised a formula as possible from the data collected,
obtaining from it a point of view and applying it in my practical work,
until it has either been confirmed, modified, or else abandoned. If
it has been confirmed, I publish it as a general view-point, without
giving the empirical material. I only introduce the material amassed
in the course of my practice in the form of example or illustration. I
therefore beg the reader not to consider the views I present as mere
fabrications of my brain. They are, as a matter of fact, the results of
extensive experience and ripe reflection.

These additions will enable the reader of the second edition to become
familiar with the recent views of the Zürich School.

As regards the criticism encountered by the first edition of this
work, I was pleased to find my writings were received with much more
open-mindedness among English critics than was the case in Germany,
where they are met with the silence born of contempt. I am particularly
grateful to Dr. Agnes Savill for an exceptionally understanding
criticism in the _Medical Press_. My thanks are also due to Dr. T. W.
Mitchell for an exhaustive review in the _Proceedings of the Society for
Psychical Research_. This critic takes exception to my heresy respecting
causality. He considers that I am entering upon a perilous, because
unscientific, course, when I question the sole validity of the causal
view-point in psychology. I sympathise with him, but in my opinion the
nature of the human mind compels us to take the final point of view.
For it cannot be disputed that, psychologically speaking, we are living
and working, day by day, according to the principle of directed aim
or purpose, as well as that of causality. A psychological theory must
necessarily adapt itself to this fact. What is plainly directed towards
a goal cannot be given an exclusively causalistic explanation, otherwise
we should be led to the conclusion expressed in Moleschott's famous
enunciation: "Man _is_, what he eats." We must always bear the fact in
mind that _causality is a point of view_. It affirms the inevitable and
immutable relation of a series of events: a-b-d-z. Since this relation
is fixed, and according to the view-point must necessarily be so,
looked at logically the order may also be reversed. _Finality is also
a view-point_, that is justified empirically solely by the existence
of series of events, wherein the causal connection is indeed evident,
_but the meaning of which only becomes intelligible as producing final
effect_. Ordinary daily life furnishes the best instances of this. The
causal explanation must be mechanistic, if we are not to postulate a
metaphysical entity as first cause. For instance, if we adopt Freud's
sexual theory and assign primary importance psychologically to the
function of the genital glands, the brain is viewed as an appendage of
the genital glands. If we approach the Viennese idea of sexuality with
all its vague omnipotence, and trace it in a strictly scientific manner
down to its psychological basis, we shall arrive at the first cause,
according to which psychic life is for the most, or the most important
part, tension and relaxation of the genital glands. If we assume for the
moment that this mechanistic explanation be "true," it would be the sort
of truth which is exceptionally tiresome and rigidly limited in scope.
A similar statement would be that the genital glands cannot function
without adequate _nourishment_, with its inference that sexuality is an
appendage-function of nutrition! The truth contained in this is really
an important chapter in the biology of lower forms of life.

But if we wish to work in a really psychological way, we shall want
to know the _meaning_ of psychological phenomena. After learning the
kinds of steel the various parts of a locomotive are made of, and from
what ironworks and mines they come, we do not really know anything
about the locomotive's _function_, that is to say, its _meaning_. But
"function" as conceived by modern science is by no means solely a
causal concept; it is especially a final or "teleological" one. For it
is utterly impossible to consider the soul from the causal view-point
only; we are obliged to consider it also from the final point of view.
As Dr. Mitchell also points out, it is impossible for us to think of the
causal determination conjointly with a final connection. That would be
an obvious contradiction. But our theory of cognition does not need to
remain on a pre-Kantian level. It is well known that Kant showed very
clearly that the mechanistic and the teleological view-points are not
_constituent_ (objective) principles, in some degree qualities of the
object, but that they are purely _regulative_ (subjective) principles
of thought, and as such they are not mutually inconsistent. I can, for
example, easily conceive the following thesis and antithesis:--

     _Thesis_: Everything came into existence according to
     mechanistic laws.

     _Antithesis_: Some things did not come into existence
     according to mechanistic laws only.

Kant says to this: Reason cannot prove either of these principles,
because _a priori_ purely empirical laws of nature cannot give us a
determinative principle regarding the potentiality of things.

As a matter of fact, modern physics has necessarily been converted from
the idea of pure mechanism to the final concept of the conservation of
energy, because the mechanistic explanation only recognises reversible
processes, whereas the actual truth is that the process of nature is
irreversible. This fact led to the concept of an energy that tends
towards relief of tension, and therewith also towards a definite final
state.

Obviously, I consider both these points of view necessary, the causal as
well as the final, but would at the same time lay stress upon the fact
that since Kant's time we have come to know that the two view-points
are not antagonistic if they are regarded as regulative principles of
thought, and not as constituent principles of the process of nature
itself.

When speaking of the reviews, I must also mention those that seem to
me beside the mark. I was once more struck by the fact that certain
critics cannot distinguish between the theoretical explanation given by
the author, and the phantastic ideas provided by the patient. One of
my critics makes this confusion when discussing "Number Dreams." The
associations to the quotation from the Bible in Chapter V. are, as every
attentive reader must readily perceive, not arbitrary explanations of
my own, but a cryptomnesic conglomeration emanating, not from my brain
at all, but from that of the patient. Surely it is not difficult to
perceive upon reflection that this conglomeration of numbers corresponds
exactly to that unconscious psychological function from which proceeded
all the mysticism of numbers, Pythagoric, Kabbalistic, and so forth,
existent from untold ages.

I am grateful to my serious reviewers, and should like here to also
express my thanks to Mrs. Harold F. McCormick for her generous help in
the production of this book.
