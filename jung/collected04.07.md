## THE CHANGE IN CHARACTER.

The most striking characteristic of the second stage in our case is the
change in character. We meet many cases in the literature which have
offered the symptom of spontaneous character-change. The first case in a
scientific publication is Weir-Mitchell's[56] case of Mary Reynolds.

This was the case of a young woman living in Pennsylvania in 1811.
After a deep sleep of about twenty hours she had totally forgotten her
entire past and everything she had learnt; even the words she spoke
had lost their meaning. She no longer knew her relatives. Slowly she
re-learnt to read and write, but her writing was from right to left.
More striking still was the change in her character. Instead of being
melancholy, she was now cheerful in the extreme. Instead of being
reserved, she was buoyant and sociable. Formerly taciturn and retiring,
she was now merry and jocose. Her disposition was totally changed.[57]

In this state she renounced her former retired life and liked to
undertake adventurous excursions unarmed, through wood and mountain, on
foot and horseback. In one of these excursions she encountered a large
black bear, which she took for a pig. The bear raised himself on his
hind legs and gnashed his teeth at her. As she could not drive her horse
on any further, she took an ordinary stick and hit the bear until it
took to flight. Five weeks later, after a deep sleep, she returned to
her earlier state with amnesia for the interval. These states alternated
for about sixteen years. _But her last twenty-five years Mary Reynolds
passed exclusively in her second state._

Schroeder von der Kalk[58] reports on the following case: The patient
became ill at the age of sixteen with periodic amnesia, after a previous
tedious illness of three years. Sometimes in the morning after waking
she passed through a peculiar choreic state, during which she made
rhythmical movements with her arms. Throughout the whole day she would
then exhibit a childish, silly behaviour and lost all her educated
capabilities. (When normal she is very intelligent, well-read, speaks
French well.) In the second state she begins to speak faulty French.
On the second day she is again at times normal. The two states are
completely separated by amnesia.[59]

Hoefelt[60] reports on a case of spontaneous somnambulism in a girl who,
in her normal state, was submissive and modest, but in somnambulism was
impertinent, rude and violent. Azam's[61] Felida was, in her normal
state, depressed, inhibited, timid; and in the second state lively,
confident, enterprising to recklessness. _The second state gradually
became the chief one, and finally so far suppressed the first state
that the patient called her normal states, lasting now but a short
time, "crises."_ The amnesic attacks had begun at 14 1/2. In time the
second state became milder and there was a certain approximation between
the character of the two states. A very striking example of change in
character is that worked out by Camuset, Ribot, Legrand du Saulle,
Richer, Voisin, and put together by Bourru and Burot.[62] It is that of
Louis V., a severe male hysteric with amnesic alternating character.
In the first stage he is rude, cheeky, querulous, greedy, thievish,
inconsiderate. In the second state he is an agreeable, sympathetic
character, industrious, docile and obedient. This amnesic change of
character has been used by Paul Lindau[63] in his drama "Der Andere"
(The Other One).

Rieger[64] reports on a case parallel to Lindau's criminal lawyer. The
unconscious personalities of Janet's Lucie and Léonie (Janet, _l.c._)
and Morton Prince's[65] may also be regarded as parallel with our case.
There are, however, therapeutic artificial products whose importance
lies in the domain of the dissociation of consciousness and of memory.

In the above cases, the second state is always separated from the first
by an amnesic dissociation, and the change in character is, at times,
accompanied by a break in the continuity of consciousness. In our case
there is no amnesic disturbance; the passage from the first to the
second stage follows quite gradually and the continuity of consciousness
remains. The patient carries out in her waking state everything,
otherwise unknown to her, from the field of the unconscious that she has
experienced during hallucinations in the second stage.

Periodic changes in personality without amnesic dissociation are found
in the region of _folie circulaire_, but are rarely seen in hysterics,
as Renaudin's[66] case shows. A young man, whose behaviour had always
been excellent, suddenly began to display the worst tendencies. There
were no symptoms of insanity, but, on the other hand, the whole surface
of the body was anæsthetic. This state showed periodic intervals, and
in the same way the patient's character was subject to vacillations. As
soon as the anæsthesia disappeared he was manageable and friendly. When
the anæsthesia returned he was overcome by the worst instincts, which,
it was observed, even included the wish to murder.

Remembering that our patient's age at the beginning of the disturbances
was 14 1/2, that is, the age of puberty had just been reached, one
must suppose that there was some connection between the disturbances
and the physiological character-changes at puberty. "There appears
in the consciousness of the individual during this period of life a
new group of sensations, together with the feelings and ideas arising
therefrom; this continuous pressure of unaccustomed mental states makes
itself constantly felt because the cause is always at work; the states
are co-ordinated because they arise from one and the same source, and
must little by little bring about deep-seated changes in the ego."[67]
Vacillating moods are easily recognisable; the confused new, strong
feelings, the inclination towards idealism, to exalted religiosity
and mysticism, side by side with the falling back into childishness,
all this gives to adolescence its prevailing character. At this epoch
the human being first makes clumsy attempts at independence in every
direction; for the first time uses for his own purposes all that family
and school have contributed hitherto; he conceives ideals, constructs
far-reaching plans for the future, lives in dreams whose content is
ambitious and egotistic. This is all physiological. The puberty of
a psychopathic is a crisis of more serious import. Not only do the
psychophysical changes run a stormy course, but features of a hereditary
degenerate character become fixed. In the child these do not appear at
all, or but sporadically. For the explanation of our case we are bound
to consider a specific disturbance of puberty. The reasons for this
view will appear from a further study of the second personality. (For
the sake of brevity we shall call the second personality IVENES--as the
patient baptised her higher ego).

Ivenes is the exact continuation of the everyday ego. She includes
the whole of her conscious content. In the semi-somnambulic state her
intercourse with the real external world is analogous to that of the
waking state, that is, she is influenced by recurrent hallucinations,
but no more than persons who are subject to non-confusional psychotic
hallucinations. The continuity of Ivenes obviously extends to the
hysterical attack with its dramatic scenes, visionary events, etc.
During the attack itself she is generally isolated from the external
world; she does not notice what is going on around her, does not
know that she is talking loudly, etc. But she has no amnesia for the
dream-content of her attack. Amnesia for her motor expressions and for
the changes in her surroundings is not always present. That this is
dependent upon the degree of intensity of her somnambulic state and
that there is sometimes partial paralysis of individual sense organs is
proved by the occasion when she did not notice me; her eyes were then
open, and most probably she saw the others, although she only perceived
me when I spoke to her. This is a case of so-called _systematised
anæsthesia_ (negative hallucination) which is often observed in
hysterics.

Flournoy,[68] for instance, reports of Helen Smith that during the
séances she suddenly ceased to see those taking part, although she still
heard their voices and felt their touch; sometimes she no longer heard,
although she saw the movements of the lips of the speakers, etc.

Ivenes is just the continuation of the waking self. She contains
the entire consciousness of S. W.'s waking state. Her remarkable
behaviour tells decidedly against any analogy with cases of _double
consciousness_. The characteristics of Ivenes contrast favourably with
the patient's ordinary self. She is a calmer, more composed personality;
her pleasing modesty and accuracy, her uniform intelligence, her
confident way of talking must be regarded as an improvement of the whole
being; thus far there is analogy with Janet's Léonie. But this is the
extent of the similarity. Apart from the amnesia, they are divided by
a deep psychological difference. Léonie II. is the healthier, the more
normal; she has regained her natural capabilities, she shows remarkable
improvement upon her chronic condition of hysteria. Ivenes rather gives
the impression of a more artificial product; there is something thought
out; despite all her excellences she gives the impression of playing
a part excellently; her world-sorrow, her yearning for the other side
of things, are not merely piety but the attributes of saintliness.
Ivenes is no mere human, but a mystic being who only partly belongs to
reality. The mournful features, the attachment to sorrow, her mysterious
fate, lead us to the historic prototype of Ivenes--Justinus Kerner's
"Prophetess of Prevorst." Kerner's book must be taken as known, and
therefore I omit any references to these common traits. But Ivenes is
no copy of the prophetess; she lacks the resignation and the saintly
piety of the latter. The prophetess is merely used by her as a study
for her own original conception. The patient pours her own soul into
the _rôle_ of the prophetess, thus seeking to create an ideal of virtue
and perfection. She anticipates her future. She incarnates in Ivenes
what she wishes to be in twenty years--the assured, influential, wise,
gracious, pious lady. It is in the construction of the second person
that there lies the far-reaching difference between Léonie II. and
Ivenes. Both are psychogenic. But Léonie I. receives in Léonie II. what
really belongs to her, while S. W. builds up a person beyond herself.
It cannot be said "she deceives herself" into, but that "she dreams
herself" into the higher ideal state.[69]

The realisation of this dream recalls vividly the psychology of the
pathological cheat. Delbruck[70] and Forel[71] have indicated the
importance of auto-suggestion in the formation of pathological cheating
and reverie. Pick[72] regards intense auto-suggestibility as the first
symptom of the hysterical dreamer, making possible the realisation of
the "day-dream." One of Pick's patients dreamt that she was in a morally
dangerous situation, and finally carried out an attempt at rape on
herself; she lay on the floor naked and fastened herself to a table and
chairs. Or some dramatic person will be created with whom the patient
enters into correspondence by letter, as in Bohn's case.[73] The patient
dreamt herself into an engagement with a totally imaginary lawyer in
Nice, from whom she received letters which she had herself written in
disguised handwriting. This pathological dreaming, with auto-suggestive
deceptions of memory amounting to real delusions and hallucinations, is
pre-eminently to be found in the lives of many saints.[74]

It is only a step from the dreamlike images strongly stamped by the
senses to the true complex hallucinations.[75] In Pick's case, for
instance, one sees that the patient, who persuades herself that she is
the Empress Elizabeth, gradually loses herself in her dreams to such an
extent that her condition must be regarded as a true "twilight" state.
Later it passes over into hysterical delirium, when her dream-phantasies
become typical hallucinations. The pathological liar, who becomes
involved through his phantasies, behaves exactly like a child who
loses himself in his play, or like the actor who loses himself in his
part.[76] There is here no fundamental distinction from somnambulic
dissociation of personality, but only a difference of degree, which
rests upon the intensity of the primary auto-suggestibility or
disintegration of the psychic elements. _The more consciousness becomes
dissociated, the greater becomes the plasticity of the dream situation,
the less becomes the amount of conscious lying and of consciousness in
general._ This being carried away by interest in the object is what
Freud calls _hysterical identification_. For instance, to Erler's[77]
acutely hysterical patient there appeared hypnagogically little riders
made of paper, who so took possession of her imagination that she had
the feeling of being herself one of them. Similar phenomena normally
occur to us in dreams in general, in which we think like "hysterics."[78]

The complete abandonment to the interesting image explains also the
wonderful naturalness of pseudological or somnambulic representation--a
degree unattainable in conscious acting. The less waking consciousness
intervenes by reflection and reasoning, the more certain and convincing
becomes the objectivation of the dream, e.g. the roof-climbing of
somnambulists.

Our case has another analogy with _pseudologia phantastica_: _The
development of the phantasies during the attacks._ Many cases are known
in the literature where the pathological lying comes on in attacks and
during serious hysterical trouble.[79]

Our patient develops her systems exclusively in the attack. In her normal
state she is quite incapable of giving any new ideas or explanations;
she must either transpose herself into somnambulism or await its
spontaneous appearance. This exhausts the affinity to _pseudologia
phantastica_ and to pathological dream-states.

Our patient's state is even differentiated from pathological dreaming,
since it could never be proved that her dream-weavings had at any
time previously been the objects of her interest during the day. Her
dreams occur explosively, break forth with bewildering completeness
from the darkness of the unconscious. Exactly the same was the case
in Flournoy's Helen Smith. In many cases (see below), however, links
with the perceptions of the normal states can be demonstrated: it seems
therefore probable that the roots of every dream were originally images
with an emotional accentuation, which, however, only occupied waking
consciousness for a short time.[80] We must allow that in the origin
of such dreams hysterical forgetfulness[81] plays a _part not to be
underestimated_.

Many images are buried which would be sufficient to put the
consciousness on guard; associated classes of ideas are lost and
go on spinning their web in the unconscious, thanks to the psychic
dissociation; this is a process which we meet again in the genesis of
our dreams.

"Our conscious reflection teaches us that when exercising attention we
pursue a definite course. But if that course leads us to an idea which
does not meet with our approval, we discontinue and cease to apply
our attention. Now, apparently, the chain of thought thus started and
abandoned, may go on without regaining attention unless it reaches a
spot of especially marked intensity, which compels renewed attention.
An initial rejection, perhaps consciously brought about by the judgment
on the ground of incorrectness or unfitness for the actual purpose of
the mental act, may therefore account for the fact that a mental process
continues unnoticed by consciousness until the onset of sleep."[82]

In this way we may explain the apparently sudden and direct appearance
of dream-states. The entire carrying over of the conscious personality
into the dream-_rôle_ involves indirectly the development of
simultaneous automatisms. "Une seconde condition peut amener la division
de conscience; ce n'est pas une altération de la sensibilité, c'est
une attitude particulière de l'esprit, la concentration de l'attention
pour un point unique; il résulte de cet état de concentration que
l'esprit devient distrait pour la reste et en quelque sorte insensible,
ce qui ouvre la carrière aux actions automatiques, et ces actions
peuvent prendre un caractère psychique et constituer des intelligences
parasites, vivant côte à côte avec la personnalité normale qui ne les
connaît pas."[83]

Our subject's romances throw a most significant light on the subjective
roots of her dreams. They swarm with secret and open love-affairs,
with illegitimate births and other sexual insinuations. The central
point of all these ambiguous stories is a lady whom she dislikes, who
is gradually made to assume the form of her polar opposite, and whilst
Ivenes becomes the pinnacle of virtue, this lady is a sink of iniquity.
_But her reincarnation doctrines, in which she appears as the mother
of countless thousands, arises in its naïve nakedness from an exuberant
phantasy which is, of course, very characteristic of the period of
puberty. It is the woman's premonition of the sexual feeling, the dream
of fruitfulness, which the patient has turned into these monstrous
ideas._ We shall not go wrong if we seek for the curious form of the
disease in the teeming sexuality of this too-rich soil. Viewed from this
standpoint, the whole creation of Ivenes, with her enormous family, is
nothing but a dream of sexual wish-fulfilment, differentiated from the
dream of a night only in that it persists for months and years.
