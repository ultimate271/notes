_From Dr. Loÿ._

    10th February, 1913.

You write that a solid knowledge of the psychoanalytic literature is
necessary for initiation into psychoanalysis. I should agree, but with a
certain reservation: the more one reads, the more one notices how many
contradictions there are among the different writers, and less and less
does one know--until one has had sufficient personal experience--to
which view to give adherence, since quite frequently assertions are made
without any proof. For example, I had thought (strengthened in the view
by my own experience of suggestion-therapy) that the transference to
the doctor might be an essential condition in the patient's cure. But
you write: "We psychoanalysts do not build upon the patient's faith,
rather do we have to deal with his criticism." And Stekel writes, on
the other hand (_Zentralblatt für Psychoanalyse_, 3rd year, vol. IV.,
p. 176, "Ausgänge der psychoanalytischen Kuren"): "Love for the doctor
can become a power essential to recovery. Neurotics never get well for
love of themselves. They recover out of love for the doctor. They give
him that pleasure." Here again, surely, stress is laid on the power of
suggestion? And yet Stekel too thinks he is a psychoanalyst pure and
simple. On the other hand, you say in your letter of Jan. 20th that "the
doctor's personality is one of the main factors in the cure." Should
not this expression be translated: "When the doctor inspires respect in
the patient and is worthy of his love, the patient will gladly follow
his example and endeavour to recover from his neurosis and fulfil his
human duties in the widest sense"? I think one can only emerge from
all this uncertainty by means of much personal experience, which will
indicate also which way best suits one's own personality and brings the
greatest therapeutic success. This is a further reason for undergoing
analysis oneself, to recognise fully what one is. I was decidedly in
agreement with your definition of psychoanalysis in its first (negative)
portion: psychoanalysis is neither an _anamnesis_ nor a _method of
examination_ after the fashion of a test for intelligence, nor yet
a _psychocatharsis_. In your second (positive) part, however, your
definition: "Psychoanalysis is a method of discovering the line of least
resistance to the harmonious development of the whole personality,"
seems to me valid for the patient's inertia, but not for the releasing
of the sublimated libido with a view to the new direction of life. You
consider that the neurosis causes a lack of singleness of aim in life,
because opposing tendencies hinder psychic adaptation. True, but will
not this psychic adaptation eventuate quite differently according as
the patient, when well, directs his life either to the avoidance of
pain merely (line of least resistance) or to the achievement of the
greatest pleasure?--In the first case he would be more passive, he
would merely reconcile himself "to the emptiness of reality" (Stekel,
_loc. cit._, p. 187). In the second he would be "filled with enthusiasm"
for something or other or some person or other. But what will determine
this choice of his as to whether he will be passive rather than active
in his "second life"? In your view, will the determining factor manifest
itself spontaneously in the course of the analysis, and must the
doctor carefully avoid swaying the balance to one side or other by his
influence? Or must he, if he does _not_ renounce the right to canalise
the patient's libido in some particular direction, renounce the right
to be called a psychoanalyst, and is he to be regarded as "moderate"
or altogether as "wild"?[181] (Cf. Furtmüller, "Wandlungen in der
Freudschen Schule," _Zentralblatt für Psychoanalyse_, vols. IV., V.,
3rd year, p. 191.) But I think you have already answered this question,
since in your last letter you write: "Every interference on the part of
the analyst is a gross mistake in technique. So-called chance is the law
and the order of psychoanalysis." But, torn from its context, perhaps
this does not quite give your whole meaning. With regard to detailed
explanation of the psychoanalytic method before the beginning of the
analysis, I think you agree with Freud and Stekel: give too little
rather than too much. For the knowledge _instilled into_ a patient
remains more or less half-knowledge, and half-knowledge engenders "the
desire to know better" (than the analyst), which only impedes progress.
So, after brief explanation, first "let the patient talk," then and
there point out connexions, then after the exhaustion of the conscious
material, take dreams.

But there another difficulty confronts me which I have already pointed
out in our talks: you find the patient adapting himself to the doctor's
tone, language, jargon, whether from conscious imitation, transference,
or even resistance, when he can fight the analyst with his own weapons;
how then can you possibly prevent his beginning to produce all manner of
phantasies as supposedly real traumata of early childhood, and _dreams_
supposedly spontaneous which are in reality, though not designedly,
directly or indirectly _suggested_? I then told you that Forel ("Der
Hypnotismus") made his patients dream just what he wanted, and I have
myself easily repeated the experiment. But if the analyst desires to
_suggest nothing_, should he remain silent for the most part and let the
patient speak--except that in interpreting dreams he may lay before the
patient his own interpretation?
