## V.--THE PERSONAL AND THE IMPERSONAL UNCONSCIOUS

The fourth stage of our newly won insight is now reached. The analytical
dissolution of the infantile transference phantasies was continued until
it became sufficiently clear, even to the patient, that he was making
his physician into father, mother, uncle, guardian, teacher, friend or
any other kind of surrogate for parental authority conceivable. But,
as experience is constantly proving, further phantasies make their
appearance, representing the physician as saviour or as some other
divine being. Obviously this is in flagrant contradiction to the sane
reasoning of consciousness. Moreover, it appears that these divine
attributes considerably overstep the bounds of the Christian conception
in which we grew up. They even assume the guise of heathen allurements,
and, for instance, not infrequently assume the form of animals.

The transference is in itself nothing but a projection of unconscious
contents on to the analyst. At first it is the so-called superficial
contents that are projected. During this stage the physician is
interesting as a possible lover (somewhat after the manner of the young
Italian in our case). Later on, he is a representation of the father,
and is the symbol either of kindness or of severity, according to what
the patient formerly imputed to his real father. Occasionally the doctor
even appears to the patient as a kind of mother, which, though sounding
somewhat strange, really lies well within the bounds of possibility.
All these projections of phantasy have an underlying basis of personal
reminiscences.

But presently other forms of phantasy appear, bearing an extravagantly
effusive and impossible character. The physician now appears to
be endowed with uncanny qualities; he may be either a wizard or a
demoniacal criminal, or his counterpart of virtue, a saviour. Later on
he appears as an incomprehensible mixture of both sides. It should be
clearly understood that the physician does not appear to the patient's
consciousness in these forms, but that phantasies come up to the surface
representing the doctor in this guise. If, as is not seldom the case,
the patient cannot forthwith perceive that his view of the physician
is a projection of his own unconscious, then he will probably behave
rather foolishly. Difficulties often arise at this stage of analysis,
making severe demands upon the good will and patience of both physician
and patient. In a few exceptional cases, a patient cannot refrain
from disseminating the stupidest tales about the physician. Such
people cannot get it into their head that, as a matter of fact, their
phantasies originate in themselves, and have nothing or very little to
do with the physician's actual character. The pertinacity of this error
arises from the circumstance that there is no foundation of personal
memory for this particular kind of projection. It is occasionally
possible to prove that similar phantasies, for which neither parent gave
reasonable occasion, had at some time in childhood been attached to the
father or mother.

In one of his shorter books, Freud has shown how Leonardo da Vinci
was influenced in his later life by the fact that he had two mothers.
The fact of the two mothers (or the double descent) had indeed a
reality in Leonardo's case, but it plays a part with other artists as
well. Benvenuto Cellini had this phantasy of a double descent. It is
unquestionably a mythological theme; many heroes of legend have two
mothers. The phantasy is not founded upon the actual fact of the hero's
having two mothers, but is a widespread "primordial image" belonging
to the secrets of the universal history of the human mind. It does not
belong to the sphere of personal reminiscences.

In every individual, in addition to the personal memories, there are
also, in Jacob Burckhardt's excellent phrase, the great "primordial
images," the inherited potentialities of human imagination. They have
always been potentially latent in the structure of the brain. The fact
of this inheritance also explains the otherwise incredible phenomenon,
that the matter and themes of certain legends are met with all the
world over in identical forms. Further, it explains how it is that
persons who are mentally deranged are able to produce precisely the
same images and associations that are known to us from the study of old
manuscripts. I gave some examples of this in my book on "The Psychology
of the Unconscious." I do not hereby assert the _transmission of
representations_, but only of the _possibility of such representations_,
which is a very different thing.

It is therefore in this further stage of the transference that those
phantasies are produced that have no basis in personal reminiscence.
Here it is a matter of the manifestation of the deeper layers of the
unconscious, where the primordial universally-human images are lying
dormant.

This discovery leads to the fourth stage of the new conception: that is,
to the recognition of a _differentiation in the unconscious itself_.
We are now obliged to differentiate a personal unconscious and an
impersonal or super-personal unconscious. We also term the latter the
_absolute or collective_ unconscious, because it is quite detached
from what is personal, and because it is also absolutely universal,
wherefore its contents may be found in every head, which of course is
not the case with the personal contents.

The primordial images are quite the most ancient, universal, and deep
thoughts of mankind. They are feeling just as much as thought, and might
therefore be termed _original thought-feelings_.

We have therewith now found the object selected by the libido when it
was freed from the personal-infantile form of transference. Namely, that
it sinks down into the depths of the unconscious, reviving what has
been dormant there from immemorial ages. It has discovered the buried
treasure out of which mankind from time to time has drawn, raising
thence its gods and demons, and all those finest and most tremendous
thoughts without which man would cease to be man.

Let us take as an example one of the greatest thoughts to which the
nineteenth century gave birth--the idea of the _conservation of energy_.
_Robert Mayer_ is the originator of this idea. He was a physician, not
a physicist nor a natural philosopher, to either of whom the creation
of such an idea would have been more germane. It is of great importance
to realise that in the real sense of the word, Robert Mayer's idea
was not _created_. Neither was it brought about through the fusion
of the then-existent conceptions and scientific hypotheses. It grew
in the originator, and was conditioned by him. Robert Mayer wrote
(1841) to Griesinger as follows: "I by no means concocted the theory
at the writing-desk." He goes on to report about certain physiological
investigations that he made in 1840-41 as doctor on board ship, and
continues: "If one wishes to be enlightened about physiological
matters, some knowledge of physical processes is indispensable, unless
one prefers to work from the metaphysical side, which is immensely
distasteful to me. I therefore kept to physics, clinging to the subject
with such ardour that, although it may well seem ridiculous to say so,
I cared little about what part of the world we were in. I preferred to
remain aboard where I could work uninterruptedly, and where many an
hour gave me such a feeling of _being inspired_ in a way I can never
remember having experienced either before or since.

"A few flashes of thought that thrilled through me"--this was in the
harbour of Surabaja--"were immediately diligently pursued, leading again
in their turn to new subjects. Those times are passed, but subsequent
quiet examination _of what then emerged_, has taught me that it was
a truth which can _not only be subjectively felt_, but also proved
objectively; whether this could be done by _one who has so little
knowledge_ of physics as I have, is a matter which obviously, I must
leave undecided."

Heim, in his book on Energetics, expresses the opinion: "that Robert
Mayer's new thought did not gradually detach itself by dint of revolving
it in his mind, from the conceptions of power transmitted from the past,
_but belongs to those ideas that are intuitively conceived, which,
originating in other spheres of a mental kind, surprise thought, as it
were, compelling it to transform its inherited notions conformably with
those ideas_."

The question now arises, whence did this new idea that forced itself
upon consciousness with such elemental power spring? And whence did
it derive such strength that it was able to effect consciousness so
forcibly that it could be completely withdrawn from all the manifold
impressions of a first voyage in the tropics? These questions are not
easy to answer. If we apply our theory to this case the explanation
would run as follows: _The idea of energy and of its conservation must
be a primordial image that lay dormant in the absolute unconscious_.
This conclusion obviously compels us to prove that a similar primordial
image did really exist in the history of the human mind, and continued
to be effective through thousands of years. As a matter of fact,
evidence of this can be produced without difficulty. _Primitive
religions, in the most dissimilar regions of the earth, are founded upon
this image._ These are the so-called _dynamistic religions_, whose sole
and distinctive thought is the existence of some universal magical power
upon which everything depends. The well-known English scholars, Taylor
and Frazer, both wrongly interpreted this idea as animism. Primitive
peoples do not mean souls or spirits by their conception of power, but
in reality something that the American investigator _Lovejoy_[241] most
aptly terms "primitive energetics."

In an investigation appertaining to this subject, I showed that this
notion comprises the idea of soul, spirit, God, health, physical
strength, fertility, magic power, influence, might, prestige, curative
remedies, as well as certain states of mind which are characterised
by the setting loose of affects. Among certain Polynesians "Melungu"
(that is this primitive concept of energy) is spirit, soul, demoniacal
being, magic, prestige. If anything astonishing happens, the people
cry "Melungu." This notion of power is also the first rendering of the
concept of God among primitive peoples. The image has undergone many
variations in the course of history. In the Old Testament this magic
power is seen in the burning bush, and shines in the face of Moses.
It is manifest in the Gospels as the outpouring of the Holy Spirit,
as cloven tongues of fire from heaven. In Heraclitus it appears as
universal energy, as "eternally living fire"; for the Persians it is the
fiery brightness, haôma, divine mercy; for the Stoics it is heimarmene,
the power of destiny. In mediæval legend it is seen as the aura, or the
halo of the saint. It blazes forth in great flames from the hut where
the saint is lying in ecstasy. The saints reflect the sum of this power,
the storehouse of light, in their faces. According to ancient concepts
this power is the soul itself; the idea of its immortality contains
that of its _conservation_. The Buddhistic and primitive conception of
the metempsychosis (transmigration of souls) contains the idea of its
_unlimited capacity for transformation under constant conservation_.

This thought has obviously therefore been imprinted on the human brain
for untold ages. That is why it lies ready in the unconscious of every
one. Only certain conditions are needed in order to let it appear
again. These conditions were obviously fulfilled in the example of
Robert Mayer. The greatest and best thoughts form themselves upon these
primordial images, which are the ancient common property of humanity.

After this instance of the nascence of new ideas out of the treasury
of primordial images, we will resume the further delineation of the
process of transference. It was seen that the libido of the patient
seizes upon its new object in those apparently preposterous and
peculiar phantasies, namely the contents of the absolute unconscious.
As I already observed, the unacknowledged projection of primordial
images upon the physician constitutes a danger for further treatment
which should not be undervalued. The images contain not only every
beautiful and great thought and feeling of humanity, but also every
deed of shame and devilry of which human beings have ever been capable.
Now, if the patient cannot differentiate the physician's personality
from these projections, there is an end to mutual understanding, and
human relations become impossible. If however the patient avoids this
Charybdis, he falls into the Scylla of _introjecting_ these images,
that is, he does not ascribe their qualities to the physician but to
himself. This peril is just as great. If he projects, he vacillates
between an extravagant and morbid deification, and a spiteful contempt
of his physician. In the case of introjection, he falls into a ludicrous
self-deification or moral self-laceration. The mistake that he makes
in both cases consists in attributing the contents of the absolute
unconscious to himself personally. Thus he makes himself into both
God and devil. This is the psychological reason why human beings have
always needed demons, and could not live without gods. There is the
exception, of course, of a few specially clever specimens of the _homo
occidentalis_ of yesterday and the day before--supermen whose God is
dead, wherefore they themselves become gods. There is also the example
of Nietzsche, who confessedly required chloral in order to be able
to exist. These supermen even become rationalistic petty gods, with
thick skulls and cold hearts. The concept of God is simply a necessary
psychological function of an irrational nature that has altogether no
connection with the question of God's existence. This latter question
is one of the most fatuous that can be put. It is indeed sufficiently
evident that man cannot conceive a God, much less realise that he
actually exists, so little is he able to imagine a process that is
not causally conditioned. Theoretically, of course, no accidentality
can exist, that is certain, once and for all. On the other hand, in
practical life, we are continually stumbling upon accidental happenings.
It is similar with the existence of God; it is once and for all an
absurd problem. But the _consensus gentium_ has spoken of gods for
æons past, and will be speaking of them in æons to come. Beautiful and
perfect as man may think his reason, he may nevertheless assure himself
that it is only one of the possible mental functions, coinciding merely
with the corresponding side of the phenomena of the universe. All around
is the irrational, that which is not congruous with reason. And this
irrationalism is likewise a psychological function, namely the absolute
unconscious; whilst the function of consciousness is essentially
rational. Consciousness must have rational relations, first of all in
order to discover some order in the chaos of disordered individual
phenomena in the universe; and secondly, in order to labour at whatever
lies within the area of human possibility. We are laudably and usefully
endeavouring to exterminate so far as is practicable the chaos of
what is irrational, both in and around us. Apparently we are making
considerable progress with this process. A mental patient once said to
me, "Last night, doctor, I disinfected the whole heavens with sublimate,
and yet did not discover any God." Something of the kind has happened
to us. Heraclitus, the ancient, that really very wise man, discovered
the most wonderful of all psychological laws, namely, the _regulating
function of antithesis_. He termed this "enantiodromia" (clashing
together), by which he meant that at some time everything meets with
its opposite. (Here I beg to remind the reader of the case of the
American business man, which shows the enantiodromia most distinctly.)
The rational attitude of civilisation necessarily terminates in its
antithesis, namely in the irrational devastation of civilisation. Man
may not _identify_ himself with reason, for he is not wholly a rational
being, and never can or ever will become one. That is a fact of which
every pedant of civilisation should take note. What is irrational
cannot and may not be stamped out. The gods cannot and may not die.
Woe betide those men who have disinfected heaven with rationalism;
God-Almightiness has entered into them, because they would not admit God
as an absolute function. They are identified with their unconscious, and
are therefore its sport. (For where God is nearest, there the danger is
greatest.) Is the present war supposed to be a war of economics? That
is a neutral American "business-like" standpoint, that does not take
the blood, tears, unprecedented deeds of infamy and great distress into
account, and which completely ignores the fact that this war is really
an _epidemic of madness_. The several parties project their unconscious
upon each other, hence the mad confusion of ideas in every head. This is
the enantiodromia that occurs in the individual life of man, as well as
in that of peoples. The legend of the Tower of Babel turns out to be a
tenable truth.

Only he escapes from the cruel law of enantiodromia who knows how to
separate himself from the unconscious--not by repressing it, for then
it seizes him from behind--_but by presenting it visibly to himself as
something that is totally different from him_.

This gives the solution of the Scylla and Charybdis problem which
I described above. The patient must learn to differentiate in his
thoughts between what is the ego and what is the non-ego. The latter is
the collective psyche or absolute unconscious. By this means he will
acquire the material with which henceforward, for a long time, he will
have to come to terms. Thereby the energy, that before was invested
in unsuitable pathological forms, will have found its appropriate
sphere. In order to differentiate the psychological ego from the
psychological non-ego, man must necessarily stand _upon firm feet_
in his ego-function; that is, _he must fulfil his duty towards
life completely, so that he may in every respect be a vitally living
member of human society_. Anything that he neglects in this respect
descends into the unconscious and reinforces its position, so that he
is in danger of being swallowed up by it, if his ego-function is not
established. Severe penalties are attached to that. As indicated by old
Synesius, the "spiritualised soul (pneumatike psyché) becomes god and
demon, a state in which it suffers the divine penalties," that is, it
suffers being torn asunder by the Zagreus, an experience which Nietzsche
also underwent at the beginning of his insanity, where, in "Ecce Homo,"
the God whom he was despairingly resisting in front assailed him from
behind. Enantiodromia is the being torn asunder into the pairs of
opposites, which opposites are only proper to "the god," and therefore
also to the deified man, who owes likeness to God to his having
prevailed over his gods.
