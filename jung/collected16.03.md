## PART II.[201]

The number of psychoanalytic investigations into the psychology of
dementia præcox has considerably increased since the publication of my
book upon the subject.[202] When, in 1903, I made the first analysis
of a case of dementia præcox, there dawned on me a premonition of the
possibilities of future discoveries in this sphere. This has been
confirmed.

Freud first submitted a case of paranoid dementia to closer
psychological investigation.[203] This he was enabled to do by means
of an analytic technique perfected through his rich experiences with
neurotics. He selected the famous autobiography of P. Schreber,
"Denkwürdigkeiten eines Nervenkranken." The patient could not be
analysed personally, but having published his most interesting
autobiography all the material wanted for an analysis was to be found in
it.

In this study Freud shows out of what infantile forms of thought and
instincts the delusional system was built up. The peculiar delusions
which the patient had about his doctor whom he identified with God
or with a god-like being, and certain other surprising and really
blasphemous ideas, Freud was able to reduce most ingeniously to his
infantile relationship to his father. This case also presented similar
bizarre and grotesque concatenations of ideas to the one I have
described. As the author himself says, his work confines itself to the
task of pointing out those universally existent and undifferentiated
foundations out of which we may say every psychological formation is
historically developed.[204] This reductive analytical process did not,
however, furnish such enlightening results in regard to the rich and
surprising symbolism in patients of this kind as we had been accustomed
to expect from the same method in the realm of the psychology of
hysteria. In reading certain works of the Zürich school, for example,
Maeder,[205] Spielrein,[206] Nelken,[207] Grebelskaja,[208] Itten,[209]
one is powerfully impressed by the enormous symbol-formation in dementia
præcox.

Some of the authors still proceed essentially by the method of analytic
reduction, tracing back the complicated delusional formation into its
simpler and more universal components, as I have done in the preceding
pages. One cannot, however, resist the feeling that this method hardly
does justice to the fulness and the almost overpowering wealth of
phantastic symbol-formation, although it does undoubtedly throw a light
upon the subject in certain directions.

Let me illustrate with an example. We should be thankful for a
commentary upon "Faust" which traced back all the diverse material of
Part II. to its historical sources, or for a psychological analysis
of Part I. which pointed out how the dramatic conflict corresponds to
a personal conflict in the soul of the poet; we should be glad of an
exposition which pointed out how this subjective conflict is itself
based upon those ultimate and universal human things which are nowise
foreign to us since we all carry the seeds of them in our hearts.
Nevertheless we should be a little disappointed. We do not read "Faust"
just in order to discover that also we are, in all things, "human, all
too human." Alas, we know that but too well already. Let any one who
has not yet learnt it go for a little while out into the world and look
at it without preconceptions and with open eyes. He will turn back from
the might and power of the "too human," hungrily he will pick up his
"Faust," not to find again what he has just left, but to learn how a man
like Goethe shakes off these elemental human things and finds freedom
for his soul. When we once know who was the "Proktophantasmist," to what
chronological events the mass of symbols in Part II. relates, how it is
all intimately bound up with the poet's own soul and conditioned by it,
we come to regard this determination as less important than the problem
itself--what does the poet mean by his symbolic creation? Proceeding
purely reductively, one discovers the final meaning in these universal
human things; and demands nothing further from an explanation than that
the unknown and complicated shall be reduced to the known and simple. I
should like to designate this kind of understanding as _retrospective
understanding_. But there is another kind of understanding, which is not
analytic reduction, but is of a _synthetic_ or _constructive_ nature. I
would designate this _prospective understanding_, and the corresponding
method as the _Constructive method_.

It is common knowledge that present-day scientific explanation rests
upon the basis of the causal principle. Scientific explanation is
causal explanation. We are therefore naturally inclined, whenever we
think scientifically, to explain causally, to understand a thing and
to regard it as explained whenever it is reduced analytically to its
cause and general principle. In so far Freud's psychological method of
interpretation is strictly scientific.

If we apply this method to "Faust" it must become clear that something
more is required for a true understanding. It will even seem to us
that we have not gathered the poet's deepest meaning if we only see in
it universal foregone human conclusions. What we really want to find
out is how this man has redeemed himself as an individual, and when we
arrive at this comprehension then we shall also understand the symbol
given by Goethe. It is true we may then fall into the error that we
understand Goethe himself. But let us be cautious and modest, simply
saying we have thereby arrived at an understanding of ourselves. I am
thinking here of Kant's thought-compelling definition of comprehension,
as "the realisation of a thing to the extent which is sufficient for our
purpose."

This understanding is, it is true, subjective, and therefore not
scientific for those to whom science and explanation by the causal
principle are identical. But the validity of this identification is open
to question. In the sphere of psychology I must emphasise my doubt on
this point.

We speak of "objective" understanding when we have given a causal
explanation. But at bottom, understanding is a subjective process upon
which we confer the quality "objective" really only to differentiate it
from another kind of understanding which is also a psychological and
subjective process, but upon which, without further ado, we bestow the
quality "subjective." The attitude of to-day only grants scientific
value to "objective" understanding on account of its universal
validity. This standpoint is incontestably correct wherever it is not a
question of the psychological process itself, and hence it is valid in
all sciences apart from pure psychology.

To interpret Faust objectively, _i.e._ from the causal standpoint, is as
though a man were to consider a sculpture from the historical, technical
and--last but not least--from the mineralogical standpoint. But where
lurks the _real meaning_ of the wondrous work? Where is the answer to
that most important question: what aim had the artist in mind, and how
are we ourselves to understand his work subjectively? To the scientific
spirit this seems an idle question which anyhow has nothing to do with
science. It comes furthermore into collision with the causal principle,
for it is a purely speculative constructive view. And the modern world
has overthrown this spirit of scholasticism.

But if we would approach to an understanding of psychological things we
must remember the fact of the subjective conditioning of all knowledge.
The world is _as we see it_ and not simply objective; this holds true
even more of the mind. Of course it is possible to look at the mind
objectively, just as at Faust, or a Gothic Cathedral. In this objective
conception there is comprised the whole worth and worthlessness of
current experimental psychology and psychoanalysis. The scientific mind,
thinking causally, is incapable of understanding what is ahead; it only
understands what is past, that is, retrospective. Like Ahriman, the
Persian devil, it has the gift of After-Knowledge. But this spirit is
only one half of a complete comprehension. The other more important half
is prospective or constructive; if we are not able to understand what
lies ahead, then nothing is understood. If psychoanalysis, following
Freud's orientation, should succeed in presenting an uninterrupted and
conclusive connection between Goethe's infantile sexual development and
his work, or, following Adler, between the infantile struggle for power
and the adult Goethe and his work, an interesting proposition would have
been solved--we should have learnt how a masterpiece can be reduced to
the simplest thinkable elements, which are universal, and to be found
working within the depths of everything and everybody. But did Goethe
construct his work to _this_ end? Was it his intention that it should be
thus conceived?

It must be sufficiently clear that such an understanding, though
undoubtedly scientific, would be entirely, utterly, beside the mark.
This statement is valid for psychology in general. To understand
the psyche causally, means to understand but half of it. The causal
understanding of Faust enlightens us as to how it became a finished work
of art, but reveals nothing of the living meaning of the poet. That
meaning only lives if we experience it, in and through ourselves. In so
far as our actual present life is for us something essentially new and
not a repetition of all that has gone before, the great value of such
a work is to be seen, not in its causal development, but in its living
reality for our own lives. We should be indeed depreciating a work like
Faust if we were only to regard it as something that has been perfected
and finished; it is only understood when conceived as a becoming and as
an ever new-experiencing.

Thus we must regard the human psyche. Only on one side is the mind a
Has Been, and as such subordinate to the causal principle. On the other
side the mind is a Becoming that can only be grasped synthetically or
constructively. The causal standpoint asks how it is this actual mind
has become what it appears to-day? The constructive standpoint asks how
a bridge can be built from this actual psyche to its own future?

Just as the causal method finally reaches the general principles of
human psychology by the analysis and reduction of individual events,
so does the constructive standpoint reach aims that are general by the
synthesis of individual tendencies. The mind is a point of passage and
thus necessarily determined from two sides. On the one side it offers a
picture of the precipitate of the past, and on the other side a picture
of the germinating knowledge of all that is to come, in so far as the
psyche creates its own future.

What has been is, on the one hand, the result and apex of all that
was--as such it appears to the causal standpoint; on the other hand, it
is an expression of all that is to be. The future is only _apparently_
like the past, but in its essence always new and unique, (the causal
standpoint would like to invert this sentence) thus the actual formula
is incomplete, germlike so to say, in relation to what is to be.

To get any conception of this expression of what is to be we are forced
to apply a constructive interest to it. I almost felt myself tempted
to say, "a scientific interest." But modern science is identical with
the causal principle. So long as we consider the actual mind causally,
that is scientifically, we elude the mind as a Becoming. This other side
of the psyche can never be grasped by the exclusive use of the causal
principle, but only by means of the constructive standpoint. The causal
standpoint reduces things to their elements, the constructive standpoint
elaborates them into something higher and more complicated. This latter
standpoint is necessarily a speculative one.

Constructive understanding is, however, differentiated from scholastic
speculation because it imposes no general validity, but only subjective
validity. When the speculative philosopher believes he has comprehended
the world once for all by his System, he deceives himself; he has only
comprehended himself and then naïvely projected that view upon the
world. In reaction against this, the scientific method of the modern
world has almost put an end to speculation and gone to the other
extreme. It would create an "objective" psychology. In opposition
to such efforts, the stress which Freud has placed upon individual
psychology is of immortal merit. The extraordinary importance of the
subjective in the development of the objective mental process was thus
first brought adequately into prominence.

Subjective speculation lays no claim to universal validity, it is
identical with constructive understanding. It is a subjective creation,
which, looked at externally, easily seems to be a so-called infantile
phantasy, or at least an unmistakable derivative of it; from an
objective standpoint it must be judged as such, in so far as objective
is regarded as identical with scientific or causal. Looked at from
within, however, constructive understanding means redemption.

"Creation--that is the great redemption from suffering and easiness of
living."[210]

       *       *       *       *       *

Starting from these considerations as to the psychology of those
mental patients to whom the Schreber case belongs, we must, from the
"objective-scientific" standpoint, reduce the structural phantasy of the
patient to its simple and most generally valid elements. This Freud had
done. But that is only half of the work to be done. The other half is
the constructive understanding of Schreber's system. The question is:
What end, what freedom, did the patient hope to achieve by the creation
of his system?

The scientific thinker of to-day will regard this question as
inappropriate. The psychiatrist will certainly smile at it, for he is
thoroughly assured of the universal validity of his causalism, he knows
the psyche merely as something that is made, descendent, reactive. Not
uncommonly there lurks the unconscious prejudice that the psyche is a
brain-secretion.

Looking at such a morbid system without preconception, and asking
ourselves what goal this delusional system is aiming at, we see, in
fact, firstly, that it _is_ endeavouring to get at something, and
secondly, that the patient also devotes all his will-power to the
service of the system. There are patients who develop their delusions
with scientific thoroughness, often dragging in an immense material of
comparison and proof. Schreber certainly belongs to this class. Others
do not proceed so thoroughly and learnedly, but content themselves with
heaping up synonymous expressions for that at which they are aiming. The
case of the patient I have described, who assumes all kinds of titles,
is a good instance of this.

The patient's unmistakable striving to express something through and
by means of his delusion Freud conceives retrospectively, as the
satisfaction of his infantile wishes by means of imagination. Adler
reduces it to the desire for power.

For him the delusion-formation is a "manly protest," a means of
gaining security for himself against his menaced superiority. Thus
characterised, this struggle is likewise infantile and the means
employed--the delusional creation--is infantile because insufficient
for its purpose; one can therefore understand why Freud declines to
accept Adler's point of view. Freud, rightly on the whole, subsumes this
infantile struggle for power under the concept of the infantile wish.

The constructive standpoint is different. Here the delusional system
is neither infantile nor, upon the whole, _eo ipso_ pathological but
_subjective_, and hence justified within the scope of the subjective.
The constructive standpoint absolutely denies the conception that the
subjective phantasy-creation is merely an infantile wish, symbolically
veiled; or that it is merely that in a higher degree; it denies that
it is a convulsive and egoistic adhesion to the fiction of its own
superiority, in so far as these are to be regarded as finalistic
explanations. The subjective activity of the mind can be judged from
without, just as one can, in the end, so judge everything. But this
judgment is inadequate, because it is the very essence of the subjective
that it cannot be judged objectively. We cannot measure distance in
pints. The subjective can be only understood and judged subjectively,
that is, constructively. Any other judgment is unfair and does not meet
the question.

The absolute credit which the constructive standpoint confers upon the
subjective, naturally seems to the "scientific" spirit as an utter
violation of reason. But this scientific spirit can only take up arms
against it so long as the constructive is not avowedly _subjective_. The
constructive comprehension also _analyses_, but it does not _reduce_.
It decomposes the delusion into _typical_ components. What is to be
regarded as the type at a given time is shown from the attainment of
experience and knowledge reached at that time.

Even the most individual delusional systems are not absolutely unique,
occurring only once, for they offer striking and obvious analogies
with other systems. From the comparative analysis of many systems
the typical formations are drawn. If one can speak of reduction at
all, it is only a question of reduction to general type, but not to
some universal principle obtained inductively or deductively, such
as "Sexuality" or "Struggle for Power." This paralleling with other
typical formations only serves for a widening of the basis upon which
the construction is to be built. If one were to proceed entirely
subjectively one would go on constructing in the language of the patient
and in his mental range. One would arrive at some structure which was
illuminating to the patient and to the investigator of the case but not
to the outer scientific public. The public would be unable to enter into
the peculiarities of the speech and thought of the individual case in
question without further help.

The works of the Zürich school referred to contain careful and detailed
expositions of individual material. In these materials there are
very many typical formations which are unmistakably _analogies_ with
_mythological formations_[211]. There arose from the perception of
this relationship a new and valuable source for comparative study.
The acceptance of the possibility of such a comparison will not be
granted immediately, but the question is only whether the materials
to be compared really are similar or not. It will also be contended
that pathological and mythological formations are not immediately
comparable. But this objection must not be raised _a priori_, for only
a conscientious comparison can determine whether any true parallelism
exists or not. At the present moment all we know is that they are both
structures of the imagination which, like all such products, rest
essentially upon the activity of the unconscious. Experience must teach
us whether such a comparison is valid. The results hitherto obtained
are so encouraging that further work along these lines seems to me most
hopeful and important. I made practical use of the constructive method
in a case which Flournoy published in the _Archives de Psychologie_,
although he offered no opinion as to its nature at that time.

The case dealt with a rather neurotic young lady who, in Flournoy's
publication, described how surprised she was at the connected
phantasy-formations which penetrated from the unconscious into the
conscious. I subjected these phantasies, which the lady herself
reproduced in some detail, to my constructive methods and gave the
results of these investigations in my book, "The Psychology of the
Unconscious."

This book has, I regret to say, met with many perhaps inevitable
misunderstandings. But I have had one precious consolation, for my book
received the approval of Flournoy himself, who published the original
case which he knew personally. It is to be hoped that later works will
make the standpoint of the Zürich school intelligible to a wider public.
Whoever, by the help of this work, has taken the trouble to grasp the
essence of the constructive method, will readily imagine how great are
the difficulties of investigation, and how much greater still are the
difficulties of objective presentation of such investigations.

Among the many difficulties and opportunities for misunderstanding I
should like to adduce one difficulty which is especially characteristic.
In an intensive study of Schreber's or any similar case, it will be
discovered that these patients are consumed by the desire for a new
world-philosophy which may be of the most bizarre kind. Their aim is
obviously to create a system such as will help them in the assimilation
of unknown psychical phenomena, _i.e._ enable them to adapt their
own unconscious to the world. This arrangement produces a subjective
system which must be considered as a necessary transition-stage on the
path to the adaptation of their personality in regard to the world in
general. But the patient remains stationary at this transitory stage
and assumes his subjective view is the world's, hence he remains ill.
He cannot free himself from his subjectivism and does not find the link
to objective thinking, _i.e._ to society. He does not reach the real
summit of self-understanding, for he remains with a merely subjective
understanding of himself. But a _mere_ subjective understanding is not
real and adequate. As Feuerbach says: _Understanding is only real
when it is in accord with that of some other rational beings_. Then it
becomes objective[212] and the link with life is reached.

I am convinced that not a few will raise the objection that in the first
place the psychological process of adaptation does not proceed by the
method of first creating a world-philosophy; secondly, that it is in
itself a sign of unhealthy mental disposition even to make the attempt
to adapt oneself by way of a "world-philosophy."

Undoubtedly there are innumerable persons who are capable of adaptation
without creating any preliminary philosophy. If they ever arrive at any
general theory of the world it is always subsequently. But, on the other
hand, there are just as many who are only able to adapt themselves by
means of a preliminary intellectual formulation. To everything which
they do not understand they are unable to adapt themselves. Generally
it comes about that they do adapt themselves just in so far as they can
grasp the situation intellectually. To this latter group seem to belong
all those patients to whom we have been giving our consideration.

Medical experience has taught us that there are two large groups of
functional nervous disorders. The one embraces all those forms of
disease which are designated _hysterical_, the other all those forms
which the French school has designated _psychasthenic_. Although
the line of demarcation is rather uncertain, one can mark off two
psychological types which are obviously different; their psychology
is diametrically opposed. I have called these--the _Introverted_ and
_Extroverted_ types. The hysteric belongs to the type of _Extroversion_,
the psychasthenic to the type of _Introversion_, as does dementia
præcox, in so far as we know it to-day. This terminology, _Introversion_
and _Extroversion_, is bound up with my way of regarding mental
phenomena as forms of energy. I postulate a hypothetical fundamental
striving which I designate _libido_.[213] In the classical use of the
word, _libido_ never had an exclusively sexual connotation as it has in
medicine. The word _interest_, as Claparède once suggested to me, could
be used in this special sense, if this expression had to-day a less
extensive application. Bergson's concept, _élan vital_, would also serve
if this expression were less biological and more psychological. Libido
is intended to be an energising expression for _psychological values_.
The psychological value is something active and determining; hence it
can be regarded from the energic standpoint without any pretence of
exact measurement.

The introverted type is characterised by the fact that his libido
is turned towards his own personality to a certain extent--he finds
within himself the unconditioned value. The extroverted type has his
libido to a certain extent externally; he finds the unconditioned value
outside himself. The introvert regards everything from the aspect of
his own personality; the extrovert is dependent upon the value of his
object. I must emphasise the statement that this question of types is
_the_ question of our psychology, and that every further advance must
probably proceed by way of this question. The difference between these
types is almost alarming in extent. So far there is only one small
preliminary communication by myself[214] on this theory of type, which
is particularly important for the conception of dementia præcox. On the
psychiatric side Gross[215] has called attention to the existence of two
psychological types. His two types are (1) those with limited but deep
consciousness, and (2) those with broad but superficial consciousness.
The former correspond to my introverted and the latter to my extroverted
type. In my article I have collected some other instances among which
I would especially call attention to the striking description of the
two types given by William James in his book on "Pragmatism." Fr. Th.
Vischer has differentiated the two types very wittily by her division of
the learned into "reason-mongers," and "matter-mongers." In the sphere
of psychoanalysis Freud follows the psychology of Extraversion, Adler
that of Introversion. The irreconcilable opposition between the views
of Freud and those of Adler (see especially his book "Über den nervösen
Charakter") is readily explained by the existence of two diametrically
opposed psychological types which view the same things from entirely
different aspects. An Extrovert can hardly, or only with great
difficulty, come to any understanding with an Introvert, on any delicate
psychological question.

An Extrovert can hardly conceive the necessity which compels the
Introvert to conquer the world by means of a system. And yet this
necessity exists, otherwise we should have no philosophical systems
and dogmas, presumed to be universally valid. Civilised humanity
would be only empiricists and the sciences only the experimental
sciences. Causalism and empiricism are undoubtedly mighty forces in our
present-day mental life but it may come to be otherwise.

This difference in type is the first great obstacle which stands in
the way of an understanding concerning fundamental conceptions of our
psychology. A second objection arises from the circumstance that the
constructive method, faithful to itself, must adapt itself to the
lines of the delusion. The direction along which the patient develops
his morbid thoughts has to be accepted seriously, and followed out
to its end; the investigator thus places himself at the standpoint
of the psychosis. This procedure may expose him to the suspicion
of being deranged himself; or at least risks a misunderstanding
which is considered terribly disgraceful--he may himself have some
world-philosophy! The confirmation of such a possibility is as bad
as being "unscientific." But every one has a world-philosophy though
not every one knows he has. And those who do not know it have simply
an unconscious and therefore inadequate and archaic philosophy. But
everything psychological that is allowed to remain in the mind neglected
and not developed, remains in a primitive state. A striking instance of
how universal theories are influenced by unconscious archaic points of
view has been furnished by a famous German historian whose name matters
to us not at all. This historian took it for granted that once upon
a time people propagated themselves through incest, for in the first
human families the brother was assigned to the sister. This theory is
wholly based upon his still unconscious belief in Adam and Eve as the
first and only parents of mankind. It is on the whole better to discover
for oneself a modern world-philosophy, or at least to make use of some
decent system which will prevent any errors of that kind.

One could put up with being despised as the possessor of a
world-philosophy; but there is a greater danger. The public may come to
believe the philosophy, beaten out by the constructive method, is to be
regarded as a theoretical and objectively valid insight into the meaning
of the world in general.

I must now again point out that it is an obstinate, scholastic
misunderstanding not to be able to distinguish between a
world-philosophy which is only psychological, and an extra-psychological
theory, which concerns the objective thing. It is absolutely essential
that the student of the results of the constructive method should be
able to draw this distinction. In its first results the constructive
method does not produce anything that could be called a scientific
theory; it furnishes the _psychological lines of development_, a _path_
so to say. I must here refer the reader to my book, "Psychology of the
Unconscious."

The analytic reductive method has the advantage of being much simpler
than the constructive method. The former reduces to well-known universal
elements of an extremely simple nature. The latter has, with extremely
complicated material, to construct the further path to some often
unknown end. This obliges the psychologist to take full account of
all those forces which are at work in the human mind. The reductive
method strives to replace the religious and philosophical needs of man,
by their more elementary components, following the principle of the
"nothing but," as James so aptly calls it. But to _construct_ aright,
we must accept the developed aspirations as indispensable components,
essential elements, of spiritual growth. Such work extends far beyond
empirical concepts but that is in accordance with the nature of the
human soul which has never hitherto rested content with experience
alone. Everything new in the human mind proceeds from speculation.
Mental development proceeds by way of speculation, never by way of
limitation to mere experience. I realise that my views are parallel
with those of Bergson, and that in my book the concept of the libido
which I have given, is a concept parallel to that of "élan vital"; my
constructive method corresponds to Bergson's "intuitive method." I,
however, confine myself to the psychological side and to practical work.
When I first read Bergson a year and a half ago I discovered to my great
pleasure everything which I had worked out practically, but expressed by
him in consummate language and in a wonderfully clear philosophic style.

Working speculatively with psychological material there is a risk of
being sacrificed to the general misunderstanding which bestows the
value of an objective theory upon the line of psychological evolution
thus elaborated. So many people feel themselves in this way at pains
to find grounds whether such a theory is correct or not. Those who are
particularly brilliant even discover that the fundamental concepts can
be traced back to Heraclitus or some one even earlier. Let me confide
to these knowing folk that the fundamental ideas employed in the
constructive method stretch back even beyond any historical philosophy,
viz. to the dynamic "views" of primitive peoples. If the result of the
constructive method were scientific theory, it would go very ill with
it, for then it would be a falling back to the deepest superstition.
But since the constructive method results in something far removed from
scientific theory the great antiquity of the basic concepts therein must
speak in favour of its extreme correctness. Not until the constructive
method has presented us with much practical experience can we come to
the construction of a _scientific theory, a theory of the psychological
lines of development_. But we must first of all content ourselves with
confirming these lines individually.
