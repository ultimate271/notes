## IV.--THE ENDEAVOURS TO FREE THE INDIVIDUALITY FROM THE COLLECTIVE PSYCHE.

1. _The Regressive Restoration of the Persona._

The unbearableness of thus being identified with the collective psyche
forces us to find a radical solution. There are two ways open. The first
possibility is the regressive one of trying to restore the persona to
its former condition, by endeavouring to restrain the unconscious by the
application of a reductive theory; for instance, by declaring it to be
nothing but long-repressed and overdue infantile sexuality, for which
it would really be best to substitute the normal sexual function. This
solution is based upon the unmistakable sexualistic symbolism of the
language of the unconscious, and upon the concretistic interpretation
of the same. Or an attempt may be made to apply the power theory,
by conceiving the God-Almightiness as a "virile protest," and as an
infantile striving for power and self-preservation: a theory for which
support is found in the unmistakable pretensions to power that the
unconscious material contains. A further possibility would be to declare
the unconscious to be the archaic collective psychology of primitive
man, an explanation that would not only cover the sexualistic symbolism
and the "God-Almighty" aiming for power of the unconscious content, but
would also apparently do justice to the religious, philosophical, and
mythological aspects and tendencies of the unconscious content. In every
case the conclusion arrived at is the same, viz. that the unconscious is
nothing but this or that, which has already been adequately recognised
and acknowledged as infantile, useless, meaningless, impossible, and out
of date. There is nothing to be done but to shrug one's shoulders and
resign one's self to the inevitable.

To the patient there seems to be no alternative, if one wishes to
continue to live sensibly, but to restore in so far as is possible
that extract of the collective psyche termed persona, to lay the fact
of analysis silently aside, and do one's utmost to forget that one
possesses an unconscious. We shall find support in Faust's words:--

    "The sphere of earth is known enough to me;
    The view beyond is barred immutably:
    A fool, who there his blinking eyes directeth,
    And o'er his clouds of peers a place expecteth!
    Firm let him stand, and look around him well!
    This world means something to the capable.
    Why needs he through Eternity to wend?
    He here acquires what he can apprehend.
    Thus let him wander down his earthly day;
    When spirits haunt go quietly his way;
    In marching onward, bliss and torment find,
    Though every moment, with unsated mind!"

This would be a happy solution if one really could succeed in throwing
off the unconscious to such an extent as to withdraw the libido from
it, and so render it inoperative. But experience proves that energy
cannot be withdrawn from the unconscious; it continues operative, for
the unconscious contains and is indeed itself the source of libido,
from which issue the primary psychic elements, thought-feelings, or
feeling-thoughts--undifferentiated germs of idea and sentiment. It would
therefore be a delusion to believe that by means of some, so to say,
magical theory or method, the libido could be conclusively wrested from
the unconscious, or that it could be to a certain extent disconnected.
One may yield to this illusion for a time, but some day he will be
obliged to declare with Faust:--

    "Now fills the air so many a haunting shape,
    That no one knows how best he may escape.
    What though one day with rational brightness beams,
    The night entangles us in webs of dreams.
    From our young fields of life we come, elate:
    There croaks a bird; what croaks he? Evil fate!
    By superstition constantly ensnared,
    It grows to us and warns and is declared.
    Intimidated thus we stand alone.--
    The portal jars, yet entrance is there none.
    Is any one here?

    CARE: Yes! must be my reply.

    FAUST: And, thou, who art thou, then?

    CARE: Well--here am I.

    FAUST: Avaunt!

    CARE: _I am where I should be_:
    Though no ear should choose to hear me,
    Yet the shrinking heart must fear me;
    Though transformed to mortal eyes,
    Grimmest power I exercise."

The unconscious cannot be "analysed" to a finish, and thus brought to
a standstill. No one can wrest active force from it for any length of
time. Therefore to act according to the method just described is only
to deceive one's self, and is nothing but a new edition of an ordinary
repression.

2. _The Identification with the Collective Psyche._

The second way would be that of identification with the collective
psyche. That would mean the symptom of "God-Almightiness" developed
into a system; in other words, one would be the fortunate possessor of
the absolute truth, that had yet to be discovered; of the conclusive
knowledge, which would be the people's salvation. This attitude is
not necessarily megalomania ("Grössenwahn") in a direct form, but the
well-known milder form of having a prophetic mission. Weak minds which,
as is so often the case, have correspondingly an undue share of vanity
and misplaced naïveté at their disposal, run a considerable risk of
succumbing to this temptation. The obtaining access to the collective
psyche signifies a renewal of life for the individual, whether this
renewal of life be felt as something pleasant or unpleasant. It would
seem desirable to retain a hold upon this renewal: for one person,
because it increases his feeling for life ("Lebensgefühl"); for another,
because it promises a great accretion to his knowledge. Therefore both
of them, not wishing to deprive themselves of the rich values that lie
buried in the collective psyche, will endeavour by every means possible
to retain their newly gained union with the primal cause of life.
Identification appears to be the nearest way to it, for the merging of
the persona in the collective psyche is a veritable lure to unite one's
self with this "ocean of divinity," and, oblivious of the past, to
become absorbed in it. This piece of mysticism belongs to every finer
individual, just as the "yearning for the mother"--the looking back to
the source whence one originated--is innate in every one.

As I have demonstrated explicitly before,[254] there is a special value
and a special necessity hidden in the regressive longing--which, as is
well-known, Freud conceives as "infantile fixation" or as "incest-wish."
This necessity and longing is particularly emphasized in myths, where it
is always the strongest and best of people, in other words, the hero,
who follows the regressive longing and deliberately runs into danger of
letting himself be devoured by the monster of the maternal first cause.
But he is a hero only because, instead of letting himself be finally
devoured by the monster, he conquers it, and that not only once but
several times. It is only through the conquest of the collective psyche
that its true value can be attained, whether it be under the symbol
of capture of treasure, of an invincible weapon, of a magical means
of defence, or whatever else the myth devises as the most desirable
possession. Hence whoever identifies himself with the collective psyche,
also reaches the treasure which the dragon guards, but against his will
and to his own great injury, by thus allowing himself (mythologically
speaking) to be devoured by the monster and merged with it.

Identification with the collective psyche is therefore a failure;
this way ends just as disastrously as did the first, which led to the
severance of the persona from the collective psyche.
