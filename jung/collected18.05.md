## V.--LEADING PRINCIPLES FOR THE TREATMENT OF COLLECTIVE IDENTITY.

In order to solve the problem how practical treatment can overcome the
assimilation of the collective psyche, we must first of all make quite
clear to ourselves what was the error of the two ways already described.
We saw that neither the one way nor the other led to any appropriate
result. The first way simply leads the patient back to the point of
departure, having lost the vital values contained in the collective
psyche. The second way leads him straight into the collective psyche,
having lost that detached human existence which alone renders possible a
bearable and satisfying life. There are on both sides values that should
not be lost to the individual.

The mistake is, therefore, neither in the collective psyche nor in the
individual psyche, _but in allowing the one to exclude the other_.
The monistic tendency assists this propensity, for it always suspects
and looks for _one_ principle everywhere. As a general psychological
tendency, monism is a peculiarity of differentiated feeling and thought,
corresponding to the keen desire to make the one or the other function
the supreme psychological principle. The introversion type only knows
the thought principle, and the extroversion type only that of feeling.
This psychological monism--or it would be better to say monotheism--has
the advantage of simplicity, and the disadvantage of one-sidedness. On
the one hand, it signifies the exclusion of the variety and true riches
of life; whilst on the other, it means the practicability of realizing
the ideals of the present day and of the near past. But it does not in
itself signify any actual possibility of human progress.

In the same way _rationalism_ tends towards exclusiveness. Its essence
is to exclude instantly whatever is opposed to its standpoint, whether
it be intellectually logical or emotionally so. In regard to reason
it is both monistic and autocratic. Special thanks are due to Bergson
for having broken a lance for the right of the irrational to exist.
Psychology will probably be obliged to acknowledge and to submit to a
plurality of principles, in spite of the fact that this does not suit
the scientific mind. Only so can psychology be saved from ship-wreck.

But with regard to individual psychology science must waive its claims.
For to speak of a scientific individual psychology is in itself a
_contradictio in adjecto_. It is necessarily always only the collective
part of an individual psychology that can be the subject of scientific
study, for the individual is--according to definition--something unique
and incomparable. A "scientific" individual psychology is a denial
of individual psychology. It may justly be suspected that individual
psychology is indeed a projection of the psychology of him who defines
it. Every individual psychology must have its own text-book, for the
universal text-book only contains collective psychology.

These remarks are intended to prepare for what has to be said about
the treatment of the aforesaid problem. The fundamental error of both
the afore-mentioned ways is simply that the subject is collectively
identified with the one or the other part of his psychology. His
psychology is individual as well as collective, but not in such a manner
as to merge the individual with what is collective, or the collective
with what is individual. The persona must be strictly separated from the
concept of the individual, in so far as the persona can be absolutely
merged with the collective. But what is individual is just that which
can never be absorbed in the collective, and is, too, never identical
with the collective. Therefore, an identification with the collective or
an arbitrary cutting-off from the collective is equivalent to illness;
it is pathological.

As has already been indicated, what is individual appears at first as
the particular selection of those elements of the collective psyche
that contribute to the composition of the persona. As I said before,
the components are not individual but collective. It is only their
combination, or the selection as a model of particular groups that
had already been combined, which is individual. That would be the
individual nucleus which is concealed by the personal mask. By the
particular differentiation of the persona, the resistance is shown of
the individuality to the collective psyche. By analysing the persona, we
transfer a greater value to the individuality, increasing thereby its
conflict with collectivity. This conflict obviously is a psychological
conflict in the individual. The dissolution of the compromise between
the two halves of a pair of opposites increases the effectiveness of
the contrast. This conflict does not exist within the sphere of purely
unconscious natural life, although the purely physiological life of the
individual also has to comply with collective demands.

The natural unconscious attitude is harmonious; the body, with its
capacities and needs, providing immediately indications and limitations,
that prevent intemperance and lack of proportion. A differentiated
psychological function, however, always inclines towards disproportion,
on account of the one-sidedness which is cultivated by the conscious
rationality of intention. What is called mental individuality, is,
also, an expression of the individual corporeity, being, so to speak,
identical with it. This sentence might obviously also be reversed,
a fact that does not materially alter the real psychological data
concerning the intimate relation of the individuality to the body. At
the same time, the body is also that which makes the subject resemble
all others to a great extent, although it is the individual body that is
differentiated from all others.

Similarly the mental or moral individuality differs from all others,
although in every respect it is so constituted as to place one person
on an equality with all others. Every living creature that is able
freely to develop itself individually without any coercion at all, will,
through the perfecting of its individuality, soonest realize the ideal
type of its species, and therefore, figuratively speaking, will have
collective validity.

The persona is always identical with a _typical_ attitude, in which
_one_ pyschological function dominates, _e.g._ feeling, or thought, or
intuition. This one-sidedness always causes the relative repression of
the other functions. In consequence of this circumstance, the persona
is hindering to the development of the individual. The dissolution of
the persona is, therefore, an indispensable condition of individuation.
It is, therefore, to some extent impossible to achieve individuation
by means of conscious intention; for conscious intention leads to a
conscious attitude, which excludes everything that "does not suit." But
the assimilation of the unconscious contents leads, on the contrary, to
a condition in which conscious intention is excluded, being replaced by
a process of development that appears to us irrational. This process
alone signifies individuation, its _product_ being individuality as
defined above, viz. as something individual that is at the same time
universal. So long as the persona exists individuality is repressed,
betraying itself at most by the particular selection of personal
requisites, of what might be called the actor's costumes. Only when the
unconscious is assimilated does the individuality become more prominent,
and with it also that uniting psychological phenomenon between the
ego and non-ego, expressed by the word _attitude_, is now no longer a
typical attitude but an individual one.

What is paradoxical in these formulations arises from the same cause
from which the conflict about the "universalia" formerly arose. The
phrase "animal nullumque animal genus est" makes the fundamental paradox
clearly comprehensible. What exists "really" is individual: that which
is universal is existing psychologically, but being caused by the
real-existing similarities of individual things. The individual is,
therefore, the individual thing that has, to a greater or less extent,
those attributes upon which the collective conception of "collectivity"
rests; and the more individual he is, the more he develops those
attributes that are the basis of a collective concept of human nature.

If a grotesque figure, suggested by the initial situation of our problem
be permitted, it is Buridan's ass between the two bundles of hay.
His questioning is obviously wrong: the question is not whether the
hay-bundle on the right or the left be the better one, or whether he
should begin to eat on the right or the left hand, _but what he himself
would like to do, what he is eager for_--that is the point. He is
thinking of the hay and not of himself, and therefore he does not know
what he really wants.

The question is: what at this moment is the natural direction of the
growth of this individual?

This question cannot be settled by any philosophy, religion or good
advice, but solely by an unprejudiced review of the psychological
germs of life which have resulted from the natural co-operation of the
conscious and unconscious on the one hand, and of the individual and the
collective on the other. One person looks for them in the conscious, and
another in the unconscious. But the conscious is only one side, and the
unconscious is only the other. For it should never be forgotten that
dreams are compensatory or complementary to consciousness. Were this not
the case, we should be obliged to regard dreams as a source of knowledge
superior to the conscious. This view would undoubtedly carry us back
to the mentality of the augur, and we should have to accept all the
consequences of such a superstitious attitude, unless, indeed, we look
upon dreams as valueless, as does the vulgar mind.

We find the _unifying function_ that we are seeking, _in the
phantasies_ in which everything that has any effectual determination
is present. But phantasies have a bad reputation among psychologists.
The psychoanalytical theories hitherto obtaining have treated them
accordingly. For both Freud and Adler the phantasy is nothing but a
so-called "symbolic" disguise of what both investigators suppose to be
the primary propensities and aims. But in opposition to these views it
should be emphasised--not for theoretical but for essentially practical
reasons--that the phantasy may indeed be thus causally explained
and depreciated, but that it nevertheless is the creative soil for
everything that has ever brought development to humanity. The phantasy
as a psychological function has a peculiar non-reducible value of its
own, whose roots are in both the conscious and the unconscious contents,
and in what is collective as well as in what is individual.

But whence comes the bad reputation of the phantasy? It owes that
reputation chiefly to the circumstance that it ought not to be taken
literally. It is worthless if understood concretistically. If we
understand semiotically, as Freud does, it is interesting from the
scientific standpoint. But if it be understood _hermeneutically, as an
actual symbol_, it provides us with the cue that we need in order to
develop our life in harmony with ourselves.

For the significance of a symbol is not that it is a disguised
indication of something that is generally known,[255] but that it is
an endeavour to elucidate by analogy what is as yet completely unknown
and only in process of formation.[256] The phantasy represents to us
that which is just developing under the form of a more or less apposite
analogy. By analytical reduction to something universally known, we
destroy the actual value of the symbol; but it is appropriate to its
value and meaning to give it an hermeneutical interpretation.

The essence of hermeneutics--an art that was formerly much
practised--consists in adding more analogies to that already given
by the symbol: in the first place, subjective analogies given by the
patient as they occur to him; and in the second place, objective
analogies provided by the analyst out of his general knowledge. The
initial symbol is much enlarged and enriched by this procedure, the
result being a highly complex and many-sided picture, which may now be
reduced to _tertia comparationis_. Thence result certain psychological
lines of development of an individual as well as collective nature.
No science upon earth could prove the accuracy of these lines; on the
contrary, rationalism could very easily prove that they are wrong. But
these lines vindicate their validity by their _value for life_. The
chief thing in practical treatment is that people should get a hold of
their own life, not that the principle of their life should be provable
or "right."

Of course, true to the spirit of scientific superstition _suggestion_
will be mooted. But it should long ago have been realised that a
suggestion is only accepted by one it suits. Beyond that there
is no suggestion, otherwise the treatment of neurosis would be
extremely simple, for we should only need to suggest health. This
pseudo-scientific talk about suggestion is based upon the unconscious
superstition that suggestion actually possesses some real magic power.
No one succumbs to suggestion unless from the very bottom of his heart
he be willing to co-operate.

By means of the hermeneutical treatment of the phantasies we arrive
at the synthesis of the individual with the collective psyche, put
theoretically, that is, but practically, one indispensable condition
is yet lacking. For it belongs to the regressive disposition of the
neurotic--a disposition in which he has been confirmed in the course of
his illness--to take neither himself nor the world seriously, but always
to rely on this or that method or circumstance to effect a cure, quite
apart from his own serious co-operation. "But you can't wash the dog
without getting his skin wet." No cure can be effected without unlimited
willingness and absolute seriousness on the part of the patient. There
are no magical cures for neurosis. Just as soon as we begin to elaborate
the symbolic outlines of the path, the patient must begin to walk
thereon. If he delude himself and shirk it, no cure can result. He must
really work and live according to what he has seen and recognised as
the direction for the time being of his individual life-line, and must
continue thereon until a distinct reaction of his unconscious shows him
that he is beginning in good faith to go a wrong way.

He who does not possess this moral function of faithfulness to himself
will never get rid of his neurosis; but he who has this faithfulness can
find the way out.

Neither physician nor patient must yield to the delusion that "being
analysed" is in itself sufficient to remove a neurosis. That would be
deception and self-delusion. Ultimately it is infallibly the moral
factor that decides between health and illness.

By the construction of the individual's life-line the ever-varying
trends and tendencies of his libido are made conscious. These life-lines
are not identical with the "directing fictions" discovered by Adler,
which are none other than arbitrary attempts to cut the persona off from
the collective psyche, and to give it independence. It might rather
be said that the "directing fiction" is an unsuccessful attempt to
construct a life-line. The unsuitability of the "directing fiction" is
also proved by the fact that the lines are tenaciously retained for much
too long a time. The hermeneutically constructed life-line is short, for
life follows no straight lines that indicate the future long beforehand,
for, as Nietzsche says, "All truth is crooked." Life-lines are therefore
neither principles nor ideals of universal validity, but points of view
and adaptations of ephemeral validity. An abatement of vital intensity,
a perceptible loss of libido, or an excessive passion or ecstasy--all
show that one such line is left, and that a new line begins, or rather
should begin. Sometimes it is enough to leave the revealing of the
new line to the unconscious; but this course should indeed not be
recommended to the neurotic under all circumstances, though there are
cases where what is needed is to learn to trust to so-called chance.
However, it is not advisable to let one's self drift for any length
of time; a watchful eye should at least be kept upon the reactions of
the unconscious, that is to say, upon the dreams: these indicate like a
barometer the one-sidedness of our attitude.[257] Therefore, I consider
it necessary, in contrast to some other analysts, for the patient after
analysis to remain in contact with the unconscious, if he would avoid
a relapse. That is why I am convinced that the real end of analysis is
reached when the patient has acquired adequate knowledge of the method
to remain in contact with the unconscious, and sufficient psychological
knowledge to be able to understand approximately his ever-changing
life-line; otherwise he is not in a position to follow the direction of
the libido currents in the unconscious, and thereby to gain conscious
support in the development of his individuality. Every serious case of
neurosis needs this weapon in order to maintain the cure.

In this sense analysis is not a method that is a medical monopoly, but
rather an art or technique or science of psychological life, which he
who has been cured must continue to foster, for the sake of his own
welfare and that of his environment. If he understands this aright he
will not pose as a psychoanalytical prophet nor as a public reformer,
but truly understanding the common weal, he will first himself reap
the benefit of the self-knowledge acquired in his treatment, and then
he will let the example of his life work what good it can, rather than
indulge in aggressive talk and missionary propaganda.

[Footnote 250: In a certain sense the "likeness to God" is always
_a priori_ present even before analysis, not only in the neurotic,
but also in the normal individual, with the difference only that the
normal individual is effectively separated from the perception of the
unconscious, whilst this separation becomes increasingly impossible to
the neurotic. In consequence of his special sensitiveness, the neurotic
is _a priori_ more closely affected by the processes of the unconscious
than is the normal person, wherefore the God-Almightiness becomes more
distinct in him than in the normal individual. By means of the knowledge
of the unconscious acquired through analysis the "God-likeness" is
increased.]

[Footnote 253: I should here observe that I am intentionally refraining
from discussing our problem from the standpoint of the psychology
of types. A specialised and somewhat complicated investigation was
necessary in order to discover formulations appropriate to the types.
For instance, "person" means something totally different to the
extrovert from what it does to the introvert. I must content myself
here with pointing out the difficulties such a task would involve. In
the types, the conscious and real adapted function in childhood is
collective, but soon acquires a personal character, and may retain this
to the end, unless the individual feels impelled to develop his type
to the uttermost. If this happens, the conscious real adapted function
attains a degree of perfection which may claim universal validity
and therefore bears a collectivistic character, in contrast to its
originally collective character. According to this mode of expression
collective psyche would be identical with "herd soul" in the individual;
but the collectivistic psychology would be a highly differentiated
adaptation to society. For the introvert the conscious real adapted
function is _thinking_, which in the lower stages of development is
entirely personal, but has a tendency to acquire a universal character
of a collectivistic kind; his feeling remains distinctly personal so far
as it is conscious, and collective-archaic in so far as it has remained
unconscious or is repressed. The opposite applies to the _feeling_ and
thought of the extrovert. The introvert is always concerned with the
endeavour to preserve the integrity of his ego, which results in a
different attitude towards his own person from that of the extrovert,
whose adaptation is made through his feelings, even at the cost of his
own person. These few sentences indicate into what an extraordinarily
difficult situation we should have been led had we considered our
problem from the standpoint of the types.]

[Footnote 257: It should be borne in mind that no moral function is to
be sought in this conception of dreams, nor do I look for it there.
This function is just as little "teleological" in the sense of a
philosophical teleology, that is to say of a set aim or purpose. It
is in the first place compensatory, because it presents a subliminal
picture of the actual situation. The phenomenon should first of all be
understood from a purely causal standpoint. But it would be unjust to
the essence of what is psychological if one were to consider it purely
causally. For it does not only tolerate, but also demand, a final
point of view. In other words, the question arises, what is the use of
bringing just this material to constellation? This is not to assert that
the final meaning of a phenomenon had already existed as an _a priori_
given purpose in the preparatory stages of the phenomenon. It would not
be permissible, according to the theory of cognition, to presuppose some
pre-existing purpose from the unmistakable final meaning of biological
mechanisms. But it would be narrow-minded if, with the justifiable
omission of the teleological conclusion, one wished also to give up the
point of view of finality. The utmost that can be said is, it is _as if_
there were some pre-existing purpose present. In psychology one must be
on one's guard against exclusive reliance either upon causality or upon
teleology.]
