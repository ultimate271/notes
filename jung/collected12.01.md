_From Dr. Loÿ._

    12th January, 1913.

What you said at our last conversation was extraordinarily stimulating.
I was expecting you to throw light upon the interpretation of my own
and my patients' dreams from the standpoint of Freud's "Interpretation
of Dreams." Instead, you put before me an entirely new conception: the
dream as a means of re-establishing the moral equipoise, fashioned
in the realm below the threshold of consciousness. That indeed is a
fruitful conception. But still more fruitful appears to me your other
suggestion. You regard the problems of psychoanalysis as much deeper
than I had ever thought: it is no longer merely a question of getting
rid of troublesome pathological symptoms; the analysed person gets to
understand not his anxiety-experiences alone, but his whole self most
completely, and by means of this understanding he can build up and
fashion his whole life anew. But he himself must be the builder, the
Analyst only furnishes him with the necessary tools.

To begin with, I would ask you to consider what justification there is
for the original procedure of Breuer and Freud, now entirely given up
both by Freud himself and by you, but practised by Frank, for instance,
as his only method: I mean "the abreaction of the inhibited effects
under light hypnosis." Why have you given up the cathartic method? More
particularly, has light hypnosis in psychocatharsis a different value
from suggestion during sleep, long customary in treatment by suggestion?
that is, has it only the value which the suggestionist contributes,
or does it claim to possess only the value which the patient's belief
bestows upon it? Or, again, is suggestion in the waking-state equivalent
to suggestion in hypnoidal states? This Bernheim now asserts to be
the case, after having used suggestion for many years exclusively in
hypnosis. You will tell me we must talk of psychoanalysis, not of
suggestion. But I really mean this: is not the _suggestion_, by means of
which the psychocatharsis in the hypnoidal state produces therapeutic
effects, (modified naturally, by the patients' age, etc.) the main
factor in the therapeutic success of the psychocatharsis? Frank, in
his "_Affektstörungen_," says: "these partial adjustments of effect,
suggestibility and suggestion, are almost altogether omitted in the
psychocathartic treatment in light sleep, in so far as the content of
the reproduced presentations is concerned." Is that really true? Frank
himself adds: "How can meditation upon the dreams of youth in itself
lead to the discharge of the stored-up anxiety, whether in hypnoidal
states or under any other conditions? Must one not suppose, with
much greater probability, that the anxiety-states would become more
pronounced through such concentration upon them?" [I have noticed that
myself, and much more than I at all liked.] One does indeed say to the
patient: "First we must stir up, then afterwards comes peace." And it
does come. But does it not come _in spite of the stirring-up process_,
because gradually, by means of frequent talks under light hypnosis, the
patient gets such confidence in the doctor that he becomes susceptible
to direct suggestion, and that produces at first improvement and
finally, cure? I go still further: in an analysis _in the waking-state_,
is not the patient's belief that the _method employed will cure him_,
coupled with his ever-growing trust in the doctor, a main cause of
his cure? And I ask even further: in every systematically carried-out
therapeutic treatment, is not faith in it, trust in the doctor, a main
factor in its success? I will not indeed say the only factor, for one
cannot deny that the physical, dietetic and chemical procedures, when
properly selected, have a real effect in securing a cure, over and above
the obvious effect of their indirect suggestion.
