## _Mystic Science._
--In reference to scientific questions S. W. put forward numerous suggestions.
Generally towards the end of the séances there was talk and debate about
various subjects of scientific and spiritistic nature. S. W. never took part in
the discussion, but generally sat dreamily in a corner in a semi-somnambulic
state. She listened to one and another, taking hold of the talk in a
half-dream, but she could never relate anything connectedly; if asked about it
only partial explanations were given. In the course of the winter hints emerged
in various séances: "The spirits taught her about the world-forces and the
strange revelations from the other side, yet she would not tell anything now."
Once she tried to give a description, but only said: "On one side was the
light, on the other the power of attraction." Finally, in March 1900, when for
some time nothing had been heard of the teachings at the séances, she announced
suddenly with a joyful face that she had now received everything from the
spirits. She drew out a long narrow strip of paper upon which were numerous
names.  Although I asked for it she would not let it leave her hands, but
dictated the following scheme to me.

[Illustration: FIG. 1.]

I can remember clearly that in the course of the winter of 1895 we
spoke several times in S. W.'s presence of the forces of attraction and
repulsion in connection with Kant's "Natural History of the Heavens"; we
spoke also of the "Law of the Conservation of Energy," of the different
forces of energy, and of the question whether the force of gravity was
perhaps a form of movement. From this talk S. W. had plainly created the
foundation of her mystic system. She gave the following explanation:
The natural forces are arranged in seven circles. Outside these circles
are three more, in which unknown forces intermediate between energy
and matter are found. Matter is found in seven circles which surround
ten inner ones. In the centre stands the primary force, which is the
original cause of creation and is a spiritual force. The first circle
which surrounds the primary force is matter which is not really a
force and does not arise from the primary force, but it unites with
the primary force and from this union the first descendants are the
spiritual forces; on the one hand the Good or Light Powers, on the other
the Dark Powers. The Power Magnesor consists most of primary force; the
Power Connesor, in which the dark might of matter is greatest, contains
the least. The further outwards the primary force streams forth, the
weaker it becomes, but weaker too becomes the power of matter, since
its power is greatest where the collision with the primary power is
most violent, _i.e._ in the Power Connesor. Within the circles there
are fresh analogous forces of equal strength but making in the opposite
direction. The system can also be described in a single series beginning
with primary force, Magnesor, Cafor, etc., proceeding from left to right
on the scheme and ascending with Tusa, Endos, ending with Connesor; only
then the survey of the grade of intensity is made more difficult. Every
force in the outer circle is combined from the nearest adjacent forces
of the inner circle.

1. _The Magnesor Group._--The so-called powers of Light descend in
direct line from Magnesor, but slightly influenced by the dark side. The
powers Magnesor and Cafor form together the so-called Life Force, which
is no single power but is differently combined in animals and plants.
Between Magnesor and Cafor there exists the Life Force of Man. Morally
good men and those mediums who bring about interviews of good spirits
on the earth have most Magnesor. Somewhere about the middle there stand
the life forces of animals, and in Cafor that of plants. Nothing is
known about Hefa, or rather S. W. can give no information. Persus is the
fundamental power which comes to light in the phenomenon of the forces
of locomotion. Its recognisable forces are Warmth, Light, Electricity,
Magnetism, and two unknown forces, one of which only exists in comets.
Of the powers of the seventh circle S. W. could only point out north
and south magnetism and positive and negative electricity. _Deka_ is
unknown. _Smar_ is of peculiar significance, to be indicated below; it
leads to--

2. _Hypnos Group._--_Hypnos_ and _Hyfonismus_ are powers which only
dwell within certain beings, in those who are in a position to exert
a magnetic influence upon others. _Athialowi_ is the sexual instinct.
Chemical affinity is directly derived from it. In the ninth circle under
it arises indolence (that is the line of Smar). _Svens_ and _Kara_ are
of unknown significance. _Pusa_ corresponds to _Smar_ in the opposite
sense.

3. _The Connesor Group._--Connesor is the opposite pole of Magnesor. It
is the dark and wicked power equal in intensity to the good power of
light. While the good power creates, this one turns into the opposite.
Endos is an elemental power of minerals. From these (significance
unknown) gravitation proceeds, which on its side is designated as the
elemental force of the forces of resistance that occur in phenomena
(gravity, capillarity, adhesion and cohesion). Nakus is the secret
power of a rare stone which controls the effect of snake poison. The
two powers _Smar_ and _Pusa_ have a special importance. According to S.
W., _Smar_ develops in the bodies of morally good men at the moment of
death. This power enables the soul to rise to the powers of light. Pusa
behaves in the opposite way, for it is the power which conducts morally
bad people to the dark side in the state of Connesor.

In the sixth circle the visible world begins, which only appears to be
so sharply divided from the other side in consequence of the fickleness
of our organs of sense. In reality the transition is a very gradual one,
and there are people who live on a higher stage of knowledge because
their perceptions and sensations are more delicate than those of others.
Great seers are enabled to see manifestations of force where ordinary
people can perceive nothing. S. W. sees Magnesor as a white or bluish
vapour, which chiefly develops when good spirits are near. Connesor is a
dark vapour-like fluid, which, like Magnesor, develops on the appearance
of "black" spirits. For instance, the night before the beginning of
great visions the shiny vapour of Magnesor spreads in thick layers, out
of which, the good spirits grow to visible white forces. It is just
the same with Connesor. But these powers have their different mediums.
S. W. is a Magnesor medium, as were the Prophetess of Prevorst and
Swedenborg. The materialisation mediums of the spiritualists are mostly
Connesor mediums, because materialisation takes place much more easily
through Connesor on account of its close connection with the properties
of matter. In the summer of 1900 S. W. tried several times to produce
the circles of matter, but she never arrived at other than vague and
incomprehensible hints and afterwards spoke no more about this.

_Conclusion._--The really interesting and valuable séances came to an
end with the production of the system of powers. Before this a gradual
decline in the vividness of the ecstasies was noticeable. Ulrich von
Gerbenstein came increasingly to the front, and filled up the séances
with his childish chatter. The visions which S. W. had in the meantime
likewise seem to have lost vividness and plasticity of formation, for S.
W. was afterwards only able to feel pleasant sensations in the presence
of good spirits, and disagreeableness in that of bad spirits. Nothing
new was produced. There was something of uncertainty in the trance
talks, as if feeling and seeking for the impression which she was making
upon the audience, together with an increasing staleness in the content.
In the outward behaviour of S. W. there arose also a marked shyness
and uncertainty, so that the impression of wilful deception became
ever stronger. The writer therefore soon withdrew from the séances. S.
W. experimented afterwards in other circles, and six months after my
leaving was caught cheating _in flagranti delicto_. She wanted to arouse
again by spiritualistic experiments the lost belief in her supernatural
powers; she concealed small objects in her dress, throwing them up in
the air during the dark séance. With this her part was played out. Since
then, eighteen months have passed during which I have not seen S. W. I
have learnt from an observer who knew her in the earlier days, that
she has now and again strange states of short duration during which she
is very pale and silent, and has a fixed glittering look. I did not
hear any more of visions. She is said not to take part any longer in
spiritualistic séances. S. W. is now in a large business, and according
to all accounts is an industrious and responsible person who does her
work eagerly and cleverly, giving entire satisfaction. According to the
account of trustworthy persons, her character has much improved; she has
become quieter, more regular and sympathetic. No other abnormalities
have appeared in her. This case, in spite of its incompleteness,
contains a mass of psychological problems whose exposition goes far
beyond the limits of this little work. We must therefore be satisfied
with a mere sketch of the various striking manifestations. For the sake
of a more lucid exposition it seems better to review the various states
separately.

1. The _Waking State_.--Here the patient shows various peculiarities.
As we have seen, at school she was often distracted, lost herself in
a peculiar way, was moody; her behaviour changes inconsequently, now
quiet, shy, reserved, now lively, noisy and talkative. She cannot be
called unintelligent, but she strikes one sometimes as narrow-minded,
sometimes as having isolated intelligent moments. Her memory is good
on the whole, but owing to her distraction it is much impaired.
Thus, despite much discussion and reading of Kerner's "Seherin von
Prevorst," for many weeks, she does not know, if directly asked,
whether the author's name is _Koerner_ or _Kerner_, nor the name of
the Prophetess. All the same, when it occasionally comes up, the
name _Kerner_ is correctly written in the automatic communications.
In general it may be said that her character has something extremely
impulsive, incomprehensible, protean. Deducting the want of balance
due to puberty, there remains a pathological residue which expresses
itself in reactions which follow no rule and a bizarre unaccountable
character. This character may be called _déséquilibré_, or unstable. Its
specific mould is derived from traits which can certainly be regarded
as hysterical. This is decidedly so in the conditions of distraction.
As Janet[22] maintains, the foundation of hysterical anæsthesia is
the loss of attention. He was able to prove in youthful hysterics "a
striking indifference and distracted attention in the whole region of
the emotional life." Misreading is a notable instance, which beautifully
illustrates hysterical dispersion of attention. The psychology of
this process may perhaps be viewed as follows: during reading aloud
attention becomes paralysed for this act and is directed towards some
other object. Meanwhile the reading is continued mechanically, the
sense impressions are received as before, but in consequence of the
dispersion the excitability of the perceptive centre is lowered, so
that the strength of the sense impression is no longer adequate to fix
the attention in such a way that perception as such is conducted along
the motor speech route; thus all the inflowing associations which at
once unite with any new sense impression are repressed. The further
psychological mechanism permits of only two possible explanations:
(1) The admission of the sense impression is received unconsciously
(because of the increase of threshold stimulus), in the perceptive
centre just below the threshold of consciousness, and consequently is
not incorporated in the attention and conducted back to the speech
route. It only reaches verbal expression through the intervention of the
nearest associations, in our case through the dialect expression[23] for
the object. (2) The sense impression is perceived consciously, but at
the moment of its entrance into the speech route it reaches a territory
whose excitability is diminished by the dispersion of attention. At
this place the dialect word is substituted by association for the motor
speech image, and it is uttered as such. In either case it is certain
that it is the acoustic dispersed attention which fails to correct
the error. Which of the two explanations is correct cannot be proved
in this case; probably both approach the truth, for the dispersion of
attention seems to be general, and in each case concerns more than one
of the centres engaged in the act of reading aloud. In our case this
phenomenon has a special value, for we have here a quite elementary
automatic phenomenon. It may be called hysterical in so far as in this
concrete case a state of exhaustion and intoxication, with its parallel
manifestations, can be excluded. A healthy person only exceptionally
allows himself to be so engaged by an object that he fails to correct
the errors of a dispersed attention--those of the kind described. The
frequency of these occurrences in the patient point to a considerable
limitation of the field of consciousness, in so far as she can only
master a relative minimum of elementary sensations flowing in at the
same time. If we wish to describe more exactly the psychological state
of the "psychic shady side," we might call it either a sleeping or a
dream-state, according as passivity or activity predominated. There
is, at all events, a pathological dream-state of very rudimentary
extension and intensity and its genesis is spontaneous; dream-states
arising spontaneously, with the production of automatisms, are generally
regarded as hysterical on the whole. It must be pointed out that these
instances of misreading occurred frequently in our subject, and that the
term hysterical is employed in this sense; so far as we know, it is only
on a foundation of hysterical constitution that spontaneous states of
partial sleep or dreams occur frequently.

Binet[24] has studied experimentally the automatic substitution of some
adjacent association in his hysterics. If he pricked the anæsthetic
hand of the patient without his noticing the prick, he thought of
"points"; if the anæsthetic finger was moved, he thought of "sticks"
or "columns." When the anæsthetic hand, concealed from the patient's
sight by a screen, writes "Salpêtrière," she sees in front of her the
word "Salpêtrière" in white writing on a black ground. This recalls the
experiments above referred to of Guinon and Sophie Waltke.

We thus find in our subject, at a time when there was nothing to
indicate the later phenomena, rudimentary automatisms, fragments of
dream manifestations, which imply in themselves the possibility that
some day more than one association would creep in between the perception
of the dispersed attention and consciousness. The misreading shows us,
moreover, a certain automatic independence of the psychical elements.
This occasionally expands to a more or less fleeting dispersion of
attention, although with very slight results which are never in any
way striking or suspicious; this dispersedness approximates to that
of the physiological dream. The misreading can be thus conceived as a
prodromal symptom of the later events; especially as its psychology is
prototypical for the mechanism of somnambulic dreams, which are indeed
nothing but a many-sided multiplication and manifold variation of the
elementary processes reviewed above. I never succeeded in demonstrating
during my observations similar rudimentary automatisms. It would seem
that in course of time the states of dispersed attention, to a certain
extent beneath the surface of consciousness, at first of low degree have
grown into these remarkable somnambulic attacks; hence they disappeared
during the waking state, which was free from attacks. So far as concerns
the development of the patient's character, beyond a certain not very
extensive ripening, no remarkable change could be demonstrated during
the observations lasting nearly two years. More remarkable is the fact
that in the two years since the cessation (complete?) of the somnambulic
attacks, a considerable change in character has taken place. We shall
have occasion later on to speak of the importance of this observation.
