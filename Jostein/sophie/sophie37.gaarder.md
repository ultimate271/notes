# The Form of a Thing Is Its Specific Characteristics
Having come to terms with Plato’s theory of ideas, Aristotle decided that
reality consisted of various separate things that constitute a unity of form
and substance. The “substance” is what things are made of, while the “form” is
each thing’s specific characteristics.

A chicken is fluttering about in front of you, Sophie. The chicken’s “form” is
precisely that it flutters—and that it cackles and lays eggs. So by the “form”
of a chicken, we mean the specific characteristics of its species—or in other
words, what it does. When the chicken dies—and cackles no more—its “form”
ceases to exist. The only thing that remains is the chicken’s “substance”
(sadly enough, Sophie), but then it is no longer a chicken.

As I said earlier, Aristotle was concerned with the changes in nature.
“Substance” always contains the potentiality to realize a specific “form.” We
could say that “substance” always strives toward achieving an innate
potentiality. Every change in nature, according to Aristotle, is a
transformation of substance from the “potential” to the “actual.”

Yes, I’ll explain what I mean, Sophie. See if this funny story helps you. A
sculptor is working on a large block of granite. He hacks away at the formless
block every day. One day a little boy comes by and says, “What are you looking
for?”

“Wait and see,” answers the sculptor. After a few days the little boy comes
back, and now the sculptor has carved a beautiful horse out of the granite. The
boy stares at it in amazement, then he turns to the sculptor and says, “How did
you know it was in there?”

How indeed! In a sense, the sculptor had seen the horse’s form in the block of
granite, because that particular block of granite had the potentiality to be
formed into the shape or a horse. Similarly Aristotle believed that everything
in nature has the potentiality of realizing, or achieving, a specific “form.”

Let us return to the chicken and the egg. A chicken’s egg has the potentiality
to become a chicken. This does not mean that all chicken’s eggs become
chickens—many of them end up on the breakfast table as fried eggs, omelettes,
or scrambled eggs, without ever having realized their potentiality. But it is
equally obvious that a chicken’s egg cannot become a goose. That potentiality
is not within a chicken’s egg. The “form” of a thing, then, says something
about its limitation as well as its potentiality.

When Aristotle talks about the “substance” and “form” of things, he does not
only refer to living organisms. Just as it is the chicken’s “form” to cackle,
flutter its wings, and lay eggs, it is the form of the stone to fall to the
ground. Just as the chicken cannot help cackling, the stone cannot help falling
to the ground. You can, of course, lift a stone and hurl it high into the air,
but because it is the stone’s nature to fall to the ground, you cannot hurl it
to the moon. (Take care when you perform this experiment, because the stone
might take revenge and find the shortest route back to the earth!)
