# The Art of Discourse
The essential nature of Socrates’ art lay in the fact that he did not appear to
want to instruct people. On the contrary he gave the impression of one desiring
to learn from those he spoke with. So instead of lecturing like a traditional
schoolmaster, he discussed.

Obviously he would not have become a famous philosopher had he confined himself
purely to listening to others. Nor would he have been sentenced to death. But
he just asked questions, especially to begin a conversation, as if he knew
nothing. In the course of the discussion he would generally get his opponents
to recognize the weakness of their arguments, and, forced into a corner, they
would finally be obliged to realize what was right and what was wrong.

Socrates, whose mother was a midwife, used to say that his art was like the art
of the midwife. She does not herself give birth to the child, but she is there
to help during its delivery. Similarly, Socrates saw his task as helping people
to “give birth” to the correct insight, since real understanding must come from
within. It cannot be imparted by someone else. And only the understanding that
comes from within can lead to true insight.

Let me put it more precisely: The ability to give birth is a natural
characteristic. In the same way, everybody can grasp philosophical truths if
they just use their innate reason. Using your innate reason means reaching down
inside yourself and using what is there.

By playing ignorant, Socrates forced the people he met to use their common
sense. Socrates could feign ignorance—or pretend to be dumber than he was. We
call this Socratic irony. This enabled him to continually expose the weaknesses
in people’s thinking. He was not averse to doing this in the middle of the city
square. If you met Socrates, you thus might end up being made a fool of
publicly.

So it is not surprising that, as time went by, people found him increasingly
exasperating, especially people who had status in the community. “Athens is
like a sluggish horse,” he is reputed to have said, “and I am the gadfly trying
to sting it into life.”

(What do we do with gadflies, Sophie?)
