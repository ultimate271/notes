# THE PHILOSOPHY OF ATHENS
Dear Sophie, When you read this you may already have met Hermes. In case you
haven’t, I’ll add that he is a dog. But don’t worry. He is very
good-tempered—and moreover, a good deal more intelligent than a lot of people.
In any event he never tries to give the impression of being cleverer than he
is.

You may also note that his name is not without significance.

In Greek mythology, Hermes was the messenger of the gods. He was also the god
of seafarers, but we shall not bother about that, at least not for the moment.
It is more important that Hermes also gave his name to the word “hermetic,”
which means hidden or inaccessible—not inappropriate for the way Hermes takes
care to keep the two of us hidden from each other.

So the messenger has herewith been introduced. Naturally he answers to his name
and is altogether very well behaved.

But to return to philosophy. We have already completed the first part of the
course. I refer to the natural philosophers and their decisive break with the
mythological world picture. Now we are going to meet the three great classical
philosophers, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Each in his own way, these
philosophers influenced the whole of European civilization.

The natural philosophers are also called the pre-Socratics, because they lived
before Socrates. Although Democritus died some years after Socrates, all his
ideas belong to pre-Socratic natural philosophy. Socrates represents a new era,
geographically as well as temporally. He was the first of the great
philosophers to be born in Athens, and both he and his two successors lived and
worked there. You may recall that Anaxagoras also lived in Athens for a while
but was hounded out because he said the sun was a red-hot stone. (Socrates
fared no better!)

From the time of Socrates, Athens was the center of Greek culture. It is also
important to note the change of character in the philosophical project itself
as it progresses from natural philosophy to Socrates. But before we meet
Socrates, let us hear a little about the so-called Sophists, who dominated the
Athenian scene at the time of Socrates.

Curtain up, Sophie! The history of ideas is like a drama in many acts.
