# Out of the Darkness of the Cave
Plato relates a myth which illustrates this. We call it the Myth of the Cave.
I’ll retell it in my own words.

Imagine some people living in an underground cave. They sit with their backs to
the mouth of the cave with their hands and feet bound in such a way that they
can only look at the back wall of the cave. Behind them is a high wall, and
behind that wall pass human-like creatures, holding up various figures above
the top of the wall. Because there is a fire behind these figures, they cast
flickering shadows on the back wall of the cave. So the only thing the cave
dwellers can see is this shadow play. They have been sitting in this position
since they were born, so they think these shadows are all there are.

Imagine now that one of the cave dwellers manages to free himself from his
bonds. The first thing he asks himself is where all these shadows on the cave
wall come from. What do you think happens when he turns around and sees the
figures being held up above the wall? To begin with he is dazzled by the sharp
sunlight. He is also dazzled by the clarity of the figures because until now he
has only seen their shadow. If he manages to climb over the wall and get past
the fire into the world outside, he will be even more dazzled. But after
rubbing his eyes he will be struck by the beauty of everything. For the first
time he will see colors and clear shapes. He will see the real animals and
flowers that the cave shadows were only poor reflections of. But even now he
will ask himself where all the animals and flowers come from. Then he will see
the sun in the sky, and realize that this is what gives life to these flowers
and animals, just as the fire made the shadows visible.

The joyful cave dweller could now have gone skipping away into the countryside,
delighting in his new-found freedom. But instead he thinks of all the others
who are still down in the cave. He goes back. Once there, he tries to convince
the cave dwellers that the shadows on the cave wall are but flickering
reflections of “real” things. But they don’t believe him. They point to the
cave wall and say that what they see is all there is. Finally they kill him.

What Plato was illustrating in the Myth of the Cave is the philosopher’s road
from shadowy images to the true ideas behind all natural phenomena. He was
probably also thinking of Socrates, whom the “cave dwellers” killed because he
disturbed their conventional ideas and tried to light the way to true insight.
The Myth of the Cave illustrates Socrates’ courage and his sense of pedagogic
responsibility.

Plato’s point was that the relationship between the darkness of the cave and
the world beyond corresponds to the relationship between the forms of the
natural world and the world of ideas. Not that he meant that the natural world
is dark and dreary, but that it is dark and dreary in comparison with the
clarity of ideas. A picture of a beautiful landscape is not dark and dreary
either. But it is only a picture.
