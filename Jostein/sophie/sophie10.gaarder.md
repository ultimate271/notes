# Nothing Can Come from Nothing
These three Milesian philosophers all believed in the existence of a single
basic substance as the source of all things. But how could one substance
suddenly change into something else? We can call this the problem of change.

From about 500 B.C., there was a group of philosophers in the Greek colony of
Elea in Southern Italy. These “Eleatics” were interested in this question.

The most important of these philosophers was Parmenides (c. 540-480 B.C.).
Parmenides thought that everything that exists had always existed. This idea
was not alien to the Greeks. They took it more or less for granted that
everything that existed in the world was everlasting. Nothing can come out of
nothing, thought Parmenides. And nothing that exists can become nothing.

But Parmenides took the idea further. He thought that there was no such thing
as actual change. Nothing could become anything other than it was.

Parmenides realized, of course, that nature is in a constant state of flux. He
perceived with his senses that things changed. But he could not equate this
with what his reason told him. When forced to choose between relying either on
his senses or his reason, he chose reason.

You know the expression “I’ll believe it when I see it.” But Parmenides didn’t
even believe things when he saw them. He believed that our senses give us an
incorrect picture of the world, a picture that does not tally with our reason.
As a philosopher, he saw it as his task to expose all forms of perceptual
illusion.

This unshakable faith in human reason is called rationalism. A rationalist is
someone who believes that human reason is the primary source of our knowledge
of the world.
