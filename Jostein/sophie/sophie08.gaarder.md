# THE NATURAL PHILOSOPHERS
The earliest Greek philosophers are sometimes called natural philosophers
because they were mainly concerned with the natural world and its processes.

We have already asked ourselves where everything comes from. Nowadays a lot of
people imagine that at some time something must have come from nothing. This
idea was not so widespread among the Greeks. For one reason or another, they
assumed that “something” had always existed.

How everything could come from nothing was therefore not the all-important
question. On the other hand the Greeks marveled at how live fish could come
from water, and huge trees and brilliantly colored flowers could come from the
dead earth. Not to mention how a baby could come from its mother’s womb!

The philosophers observed with their own eyes that nature was in a constant
state of transformation. But how could such transformations occur?

How could something change from being substance to being a living thing, for
example?

All the earliest philosophers shared the belief that there had to be a certain
basic substance at the root of all change. How they arrived at this idea is
hard to say. We only know that the notion gradually evolved that there must be
a basic substance that was the hidden cause of all changes in nature. There had
to be “something” that all things came from and returned to.

For us, the most interesting part is actually not what solutions these earliest
philosophers arrived at, but which questions they asked and what type of answer
they were looking for. We are more interested in how they thought than in
exactly what they thought.

We know that they posed questions relating to the transformations they could
observe in the physical world. They were looking for the underlying laws of
nature. They wanted to understand what was happening around them without having
to turn to the ancient myths. And most important, they wanted to understand the
actual processes by studying nature itself. This was quite different from
explaining thunder and lightning or winter and spring by telling stories about
the gods.

So philosophy gradually liberated itself from religion. We could say that the
natural philosophers took the first step in the direction of scientific
reasoning, thereby becoming the precursors of what was to become science.

Only fragments have survived of what the natural philosophers said and wrote.
What little we know is found in the writings of Aristotle, who lived two
centuries later. He refers only to the conclusions the philosophers reached. So
we do not always know by what paths they reached these conclusions. But what we
do know enables us to establish that the earliest Greek philosophers’ project
concerned the question of a basic constituent substance and the changes in
nature.
