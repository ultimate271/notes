# PHILOSOPHER AND SCIENTIST
Dear Sophie: You were probably astonished by Plato’s theory or ideas. You are
not the only one! I do not know whether you swallowed the whole thing—hook,
line, and sinker—or whether you had any critical comments. But if you did have,
you can be sure that the self-same criticism was raised by Aristotle (384-322
B.C.), who was a pupil at Plato’s Academy for almost twenty years.

Aristotle was not a native of Athens. He was born in Macedonia and came to
Plato’s Academy when Plato was 61. Aristotle’s father was a respected
physician— and therefore a scientist. This background already tells us
something about Aristotle’s philosophic project. What he was most interested in
was nature study. He was not only the last of the great Greek philosophers, he
was Europe’s first great biologist.

Taking it to extremes, we could say that Plato was so engrossed in his eternal
forms, or “ideas,” that he took very little notice of the changes in nature.
Aristotle, on the other hand, was preoccupied with just these changes—or with
what we nowadays describe as natural processes.

To exaggerate even more, we could say that Plato turned his back on the sensory
world and shut his eyes to everything we see around us. (He wanted to escape
from the cave and look out over the eternal world of ideas!) Aristotle did the
opposite: he got down on all fours and studied frogs and fish, anemones and
poppies.

While Plato used his reason, Aristotle used his senses as well.

We find decisive differences between the two, not least in their writing. Plato
was a poet and mythologist; Aristotle’s writings were as dry and precise as an
encyclopedia. On the other hand, much of what he wrote was based on
up-to-the-minute field studies.

Records from antiquity refer to 170 titles supposedly written by Aristotle. Of
these, 47 are preserved. These are not complete books; they consist largely of
lecture notes. In his time, philosophy was still mainly an oral activity.

The significance of Aristotle in European culture is due not least to the fact
that he created the terminology that scientists use today. He was the great
organizer who founded and classified the various sciences.

Since Aristotle wrote on all the sciences, I will limit myself to some of the
most important areas. Now that I have told you such a lot about Plato, you must
start by hearing how Aristotle refuted Plato’s theory of ideas. Later we will
look at the way he formulated his own natural philosophy, since it was
Aristotle who summed up what the natural philosophers before him had said.
We’ll see how he categorizes our concepts and founds the discipline of Logic as
a science. And finally I’ll tell you a little about Aristotle’s view of man and
society.
