# THREE PHILOSOPHERS FROM MILETUS
The first philosopher we know of is Thales, who came from Miletus, a Greek
colony in Asia Minor. He traveled in many countries, including Egypt, where he
is said to have calculated the height of a pyramid by measuring its shadow at
the precise moment when the length of his own shadow was equal to his height.
He is also said to have accurately predicted a solar eclipse in the year 585
B.C.

Thales thought that the source of all things was water. We do not know exactly
what he meant by that, he may have believed that all life originated from
water—and that all life returns to water again when it dissolves.

During his travels in Egypt he must have observed how the crops began to grow
as soon as the floods of the Nile receded from the land areas in the Nile
Delta. Perhaps he also noticed that frogs and worms appeared wherever it had
just been raining.

It is likely that Thales thought about the way water turns to ice or vapor—and
then turns back into water again.

Thales is also supposed to have said that “all things are full of gods.” What
he meant by that we can only surmise. Perhaps, seeing how the black earth was
the source of everything from flowers and crops to insects and cockroaches, he
imagined that the earth was filled with tiny invisible “life-germs.” One thing
is certain—he was not talking about Homer’s gods.

The next philosopher we hear of is Anaximander, who also lived in Miletus at
about the same time as Thales. He thought that our world was only one of a
myriad of worlds that evolve and dissolve in something he called the boundless.
It is not so easy to explain what he meant by the boundless, but it seems clear
that he was not thinking of a known substance in the way that Thales had
envisaged. Perhaps he meant that the substance which is the source of all
things had to be something other than the things created. Because all created
things are limited, that which comes before and after them must be “boundless.”
It is clear that this basic stuff could not be anything as ordinary as water.

A third philosopher from Miletus was Anaximenes (c. 570—526 B.C.). He thought
that the source of all things must be “air” or “vapor.” Anaximenes was of
course familiar with Tholes’ theory of water. But where does water come from?
Anaximenes thought that water was condensed air. We observe that when it rains,
water is pressed from the air. When water is pressed even more, it becomes
earth, he thought. He may have seen how earth and sand were pressed out of
melting ice. He also thought that fire was rarefied air. According to
Anaximenes, air was therefore the origin of earth, water, and fire.

It is not a far cry from water to the fruit of the earth. Perhaps Anaximenes
thought that earth, air, and fire were all necessary to the creation of life,
but that the source of all things was air or vapor. So, like Thales, he thought
that there must be an underlying substance that is the source of all natural
change.
