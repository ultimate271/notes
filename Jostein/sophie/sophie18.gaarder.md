# The Oracle at Delphi
The ancient Greeks believed that they could consult the famous oracle at Delphi
about their fate. Apollo, the god of the oracle, spoke through his priestess
Pythia, who sat on a stool over a fissure in the earth, from which arose
hypnotic vapors that put Pythia in a trance. This enabled her to be Apollo’s
mouthpiece. When people came to Delphi they had to present their question to
the priests of the oracle, who passed it on to Pythia. Her answer would be so
obscure or ambiguous that the priests would have to interpret it. In that way,
the ieople got the benefit of Apollo’s wisdom, believing that e knew
everything, even about the future.

There were many heads of state who dared not go to war or take other decisive
steps until they had consulted the oracle at Delphi. The priests of Apollo thus
functioned more or less as diplomats, or advisers. They were experts with an
intimate knowledge of the people and the country.

Over the entrance to the temple at Delphi was a famous inscription: KNOW
THYSELF! It reminded visitors that man must never believe himself to be more
than mortal—and that no man can escape his destiny.

The Greeks had many stories of people whose destiny catches up with them. As
time went by, a number of plays—tragedies—were written about these “tragic”
people. The most famous one is the tragedy of King Oedipus.
