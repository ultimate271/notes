Let me try to say a few words about how all this hangs together, my dear
Sophie. As Christianity makes its entry into the Greco-Roman world we are
witnessing a dramatic meeting of two cultures. We are also seeing one of
history’s great cultural revolutions.

We are about to step out of antiquity. Almost one thousand years have passed
since the days of the early Greek philosophers. Ahead of us we have the
Christian Middle Ages, which also lasted for about a thousand years.

The German poet Goethe once said that “he who cannot draw on three thousand
years is living from hand to mouth.” I don’t want you to end up in such a sad
state. I will do what I can to acquaint you with your historical roots. It is
the only way to become a human being. It is the only way to become more than a
naked ape. It is the only way to avoid floating in a vacuum.

“It is the only way to become a human being. It is the only way to become more
than a naked ape ...”

Sophie sat for a while staring into the garden through the little holes in the
hedge. She was beginning to understand why it was so important to know about
her historical roots. It had certainly been important to the Children of
Israel.

She herself was just an ordinary person. But if she knew her historical roots,
she would be a little less ordinary.

She would not be living on this planet for more than a few years. But if the
history of mankind was her own history, in a way she was thousands of years old.
