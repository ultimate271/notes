# Politics
The undesirability of cultivating extremes is also expressed in Aristotle’s
view of society. He says that man is by nature a “political animal.” Without a
society around us, we are not real people, he claimed. He pointed out that the
family and the village satisfy our primary needs of food, warmth, marriage, and
child rearing. But the highest form of human fellowship is only to be found in
the state.

This leads to the question of how the state should be organized. (You remember
Plato’s “philosophic state”?) Aristotle describes three good forms of
constitution.

One is monarchy, or kingship—which means there is only one head of state. For
this type of constitution to be good, it must not degenerate into
“tyranny”—that is, when one ruler governs the state to his own advantage.
Another good form of constitution is aristocracy, in which there is a larger or
smaller group of rulers. This constitutional form must beware of degenerating
into an “oligarchy”—when the government is run by a few people. An example of
that would be a junta. The third good constitutional form is what Aristotle
called polity, which means democracy. But this form also has its negative
aspect. A democracy can quickly develop into mob rule. (Even if the tyrannic
Hitler had not become head of state in Germany^ all the lesser Nazis could have
formed a terrifying mob rule.)
