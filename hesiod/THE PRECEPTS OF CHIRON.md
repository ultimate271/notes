# THE PRECEPTS OF CHIRON
(fragments)

Fragment #1--Scholiast on Pindar, Pyth. vi. 19: 'And now, pray, mark
all these things well in a wise heart. First, whenever you come to your
house, offer good sacrifices to the eternal gods.'


Fragment #2--Plutarch Mor. 1034 E: 'Decide no suit until you have heard
both sides speak.'


Fragment #3--Plutarch de Orac. defectu ii. 415 C: 'A chattering crow
lives out nine generations of aged men, but a stag's life is four times
a crow's, and a raven's life makes three stags old, while the phoenix
outlives nine ravens, but we, the rich-haired Nymphs, daughters of Zeus
the aegis-holder, outlive ten phoenixes.'


Fragment #4--Quintilian, i. 15: Some consider that children under the
age of seven should not receive a literary education... That Hesiod
was of this opinion very many writers affirm who were earlier than the
critic Aristophanes; for he was the first to reject the "Precepts", in
which book this maxim occurs, as a work of that poet.
