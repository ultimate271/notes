# THE GREAT WORKS
(fragments)

Fragment #1--Comm. on Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics. v. 8: The verse,
however (the slaying of Rhadamanthys), is in Hesiod in the "Great Works"
and is as follows: 'If a man sow evil, he shall reap evil increase; if
men do to him as he has done, it will be true justice.'


Fragment #2--Proclus on Hesiod, Works and Days, 126: Some believe that
the Silver Race (is to be attributed to) the earth, declaring that in
the "Great Works" Hesiod makes silver to be of the family of Earth.
