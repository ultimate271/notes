Help me, o muse, to tell about the fall of man. Who was the cause of the fall?
##
It was satan, in the form of a serpent. He did it because he wanted to rise
above his peers. He failed at opposing God directly, and God threw him and his
allies into hell.
##
Hell was pretty big, and it sucked, it's full of fire and suffering and endless
torment. Satan goes through a mix of emotions in the fall. Beelzabub is there
with Satan. Satan begins to speak.
