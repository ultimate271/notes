# EPILOGUE

February 12, 1973

'We are honored to have the opportunity to serve our country under difficult circumstances,' Captain Jeremiah Denton said, ending a thirty-four-word statement that rang across the ramp at Clark Air Force Base with 'God bless America.'

'How about that,' the commentator said, sharing the experience as he was paid to do. 'Right there behind Captain Denton is Colonel Robin Zacharias, of the Air Force. He's one of the fifty-three prisoners about whom we had no information until very recently, along with . . .'

John Clark didn't listen to the rest. He looked at the TV that sat on his wife's dresser in the bedroom, at the face of a man half a world away, to whom he'd been much closer in body, closer still in spirit not so long before. He saw the man embrace his wife after what had to be five years of separation. He saw a woman who'd grown old with worry, but now was young with love for the husband she'd thought dead. Kelly wept with them, seeing the man's face for the first time as a thing of animation, seeing the joy that really could replace pain, no matter how vast. He squeezed Sandy's hand so hard that he almost hurt it until she rested his on her belly to feel the movement of their soon-to-be firstborn. The phone rang then, and Kelly was angry for the invasion of the moment until he heard the voice.

'I hope you're proud of yourself, John,' Dutch Maxwell said. 'We're getting all twenty back. I wanted to make sure you knew that. It wouldn't have happened without you.'

'Thank you, sir.' Clark hung up. There was nothing else to be said.

'Who was that?' Sandy asked, holding his hand in place.

'A friend,' Clark said, wiping his eyes as he turned to kiss his wife. 'From another life.'
