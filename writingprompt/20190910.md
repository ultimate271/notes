# Prompt
A man from a fantasy world (to be discovered in real time by the reader as
neccesary) has just had a revelatory vision and must write it down as soon as
possible. The nature of his vision was such that he can't remember the details
of it, and must gather them in real time as he navigates the re-vision through
the mythological pantheon through which visions are judged. This article is his
first-person account of the process by which his vision becomes approved in to
pantheonic law.

# Writing
Come to me all who have an ear! Let those who may read take in my words! I
speak to you now as a man humbled yet emboldened by those discovered things
that only the select few are given access to.

Yet I can already feel my revalation waning! Already in three simple sentences
does the clarity of my visions elude my being. Yet I know with the resolve of
one that knows clearly that what he is doing is his deepest and utmost purpose
that the whole of my being will be able to conjure up those demons which
brought forth my catharsis in to being and allowed me to become a new man born
anew as you see me today. I must relay the method and process by which this
process occured so as to be seen not as a madman but instead as a the
benevolent sorcerer that I wish to become.

Speak, O Muse! Must your visions be so fleeting as to escape me before I can
even so much as write them down? Come back to me as you did in those moments
when I felt most lost. Return to me as you may when the darkness begins to
subside and all that was once known to be true begins to fade away. Speak to me
again as you spoke to me before so that I may capture the essence of your words
and act as a conduit to those that would seek to read!

Some background must be given if any coherency is expected to emerge out of
these words.

My given name is Jerry, Barbarian and my clan has been with the Dolthraki since
my inevitable birth eighty seven years ago. Such details might be irrelevent to
those members of certain corners of the multiverse which I have newly
discovered but let them be known to those people as plainly and simply as I
have written them before you now.

From birth I acquired a taste for all things magical and fantastical. I have
hence discovered that most iterations of our interconnected multiverse have
commonplace dealings which such things and that my universe is some such
exception to the general norm that all things that exist forthrightly should be
so forthrightly brought in to the lives of our day to day being. My iteration
was no such place.

In my world the ideas of magic was buried deep in tomes that were engraved in
to catacombs and locked by impassable steel bars guarded by secret
organizations and societies that make it their goal to hide such things from
the public eye. They enforce their perogative with such verocity as to slay and
execute publicly those that would seek to speak what I now know is the utter
and undeniable truth about our world; that magic is a recurrent phenomena and
that it might be harnessed by those that come to be adept to wield.

Oh, woe is me for not seeing through the lies and deception earlier! Such is
not profitable to lament the past sufferings of the individual living in the
lie perpetuated by the greater powers at large but simultaneous is it stunning
to me the precariousness of such a livelihood. I am as one with a viel that has
been lifted to see the atrocities and dishonesties by those who would seek to
gain from the continued repression and repeated propoganda produced by the
greater powers of the forces that govern the whole of our section of this
multiverse.

But enough on my own continued astonishment at the sheer dishonesty of those I
used to rever as the most true and reverent word of our day. If only I could
surpass mere distraction and instead return to that which matters. Magic is a
phenomena that can be harnessed and utilized! By means of contemplative thought
and continued untrampled arousal can the individual probe in to a world that
seeks to provide itself above and beyond that which we usually consider "real"
or "actual". Such concepts as the "spirit" can be coupled with these words as
not mere triphles and oddities but instead as true and rapturous aspects of our
very being. The notion of symbolic unity is more than just a useful mental
guide by those that would seek to act contrary to our oppressive overbearers;
it is instead a tool by which the manifest being can transcende the notion of
the physical world and instead enter in to the fantastical world of all that
would or could exist in the multiverse of our free thought.

Yet what can be said to those members of my world which are still so captured
by this notion of divive inspiration as to continue to prepretuate a toxic
cycle of discovery and repression which only seeks to multiply the host of
demons to its subconscious trapdoor which can only hold so much pressure before
the demonic army bursts forth out of the gates of hell we place on them and
seek to ransack and destroy all that which the government tried so vainlessly
to set in place? If only a mere shaking of the shoulders would be enough to
startle the complacent man in to existence. Should I only need to touch someone
with a Midas like finger to bring in to their essence all of that which is now
known to me and irrefutably provable even under their most rigourous form of
testing.

But my truth would yet be taken as an argument, and my people are always wont
to filibuster those things which aim to come to the heart of their disfunction.
If I could only take the visions recieved from these tomes and transfer them
directly to the minds of those stubborn minded but ultimately well formed
individuals that would benefit greatly by seeing what I may see.

No matter. Such is not my cause. Such is not my purpose. I know that now. I am
not meant to bring my people to salvation. I am not the bulwark of light to
be displayed on a cross so that my people may be saved. That role must be
reserved for another as it is certainly not meant for me. I am too enthralled
and angered by those that aimed to grab at my ankles and tear me in to their
own dubious pitfalls. I am too resentful to the man that would "correct" my
"pathological" ways and as a result cause me to doubt even my own very
experience for years and years at a time.

How awful it appears to me now! For what is there to trust more than ones own
experience? If the experience of one man does not match the doings of another,
must this not be rectified in a steadfast and coherent way? Is it not in the
best interest of both parties to discuss and come to some agreement about the
reality of the discongruancy of the two accounts of one phenomena? Because why
should the feelings and essence of one man be supersceded by another simply
because he is stronger or more powerful in the physical realm? Should not
evalation of spiritual ideas be measured against a spiritual scale rather than
a physical one?

Such astonishment at these false and fanciful ideas so prevalent in the world
that I hestitate to call my own (but I am still yet required to as it was
indeed and undeniably the place of my birth) is yet still continued distraction
from the undeniable fact that these men are inherently and undeniably lying
about the truth of the world. I have seen the nature of our existence on it's
uttermost and undeniable plane of that which all things spring from and I have
seen with irrefutable eyes that which all life springs from. Using this
knowledge I am able to commit acts previous thought to be impossible.

Yet my people continue to label me insane. They confine me to the role of
"madman" and quarantine not only my physical body but also the thoughts that
spring from my mind so that I will not "infect" those around me. They claim
that I am making tricks to decieve the youths of our world and make every
effort to shun me and push away the things I can do so that they may continue
to be hidden to the public eye. Such is the prevalance of their lie that they
must deeply bury anything which might challenge their narrative. It only seems
obvious to me now that such a delicate narrative must be false; if the
framework on which you base your understanding of the world can't stand up to
the scrutiny of argument and question then it becomes only obvious to rebuild
that framework on sturdier ground and construct it so that the stresses and
needs of everyday beings can be accomodated by that which the world must have
been spawned from. How it seems so obvious to me now!

No longer will I accept their narrative! No more am I a slave to the ideas they
perpetually bring forth in to existance! Magic is real. I have seen it. I have
wielded it. It is undeniable. While it is still as of yet a fresh skill to me
and as such crude and unpolished an endeveor it is simultaneously something
that I know must be honed and sharpened. To be given the wellspring of
existance and subsequently toss it aside as mere fancy and plaything is the
role of the dubious philosopher who would aim to pacify with his words rather
than stand up and speak with his actions.

I must become that which I abhore! I am that dubious philsopher. For in my
discovery I have it now to be known that I must get up and act in the world in
order to show the world what it is that I have become. I must use my abilities
in the ways of which I know to be true so that others might see what is
possible and might join me in my passions. In acting out the things which I
have newly discovered I might bring them to those very people that I previously
abhored.

Love must I show to the man who would seek to deny me access to those anchor
points which I have found. If not love then he will only abhore me and my
actions as I abhore him and his. Distaste will be met with further distaste;
free charity must I give because the wellspring of my revelation allows me to.

A conduit I must become. Connected to that which is known to be true to me in
the moment that I saw it I must be in order to continue to perpetuate the
vision which I know to be real. One must I become so that the magic of my
thoughts might be brought forth as the reality of all that comes in to being. I
am the sorcerer! Yet not for my own devices do I act. Not even for the sake of
the well being of others do I seek to harness my art. I work not for their
reasons anylonger. I work for the reason that the conduit of truth which I am
now connected to requires me act in the only way that this physical being would
know how. In living with the physical world I have gained much physical
prowress, and in guiding my physical essence in to the world of the spirutual
am I able to connect that which is already skilled and guided into the realm of
that which is freshly new and inexperienced to me.

If only it were so easy to convince others of this world so they might join me
in my endeavors! My task would come all the easier if I only had a others to
share in the thoughts and experiences that I have come to. Yet none here would
aim to be such a mate lest they pass through the barrier of ostracization and
ridicule that I required to discover the truth as I have in the way that I did.

It would be only too simple if I could reverse-engineer my path towards the
truth as I have discovered and remove those bits along the way that I can now
see as wholly counter-productive and ultimately meaningless. But if such a
thing were possible than this world would not have the intratracy and beauty
which I now see with open eyes as the deepest and ever efferecent nature of
that core which I gather my newly acquired ability. The barrier to entry is
neccesarily wide. While the impatient masochist in me would aim to pull others
towards me without regard for their own journies and their own paths I must
remind myself that this sublimation of thoughts and ideas must take place in
individual which needs to substantiate such things and cannot be forced or
otherwise coerced before it is ready to occur. If only I could bring them to a
square of object so enchanted to facilite free growth of thought! But such a
thing is not possible. I know it now to be the journey of all to come to that
final exit point which all things are determined to end. And I am to land on
the place that is appropiate for those aspcets of my being which I call "me".
If I could only show others the disolving of those concepts to instead become a
part of that entire glowing cylindar from which all thought both free or
otherwise comes from.

But enough! I can't be brought to dwell upon the tragedies of my own particular
situation. I must work to hone my art. I must work to show others that my
discovery is not made for evil but instead it is the evil which warps and
twists the shadow of our essence to bring forth those men that would call
themselves "good". I must humble myself before the great vision of our creation
so that I may continually seek to understand it even more fully and even more
rapturously day to day. The continual conflict growing inside myself indicates
that I am losing that which I grow weary of writing about. I must sublimate
myself in to those aspects which my Dolthraki family would call the "spawn of
the devil" so that I might remind myself of the importance of guiding my
actions deliberately from the world of the psychical in to the world of the
physical and back again in to the psychical world all in good conscious and
utmost clarity. I cannot tell people the benefit of such doings, I must show
them the nature in which the integration of such ideas is not the talk of
lunatics and madmen but is instead the most deeply important and ulitmately
divine (divine in a way that these so called "divinators" have never even
flirted with) way that the individual can bring himself to rectify and justify
his existance in both the physical world of actions and in the psychical world
of thoughts. Thoughts form actions and action form thoughts. It's so simple an
idea yet a taboo on thought prevents the population from ever discovering it.

Sadness overtakes me as I imagine all the lost minds who never discover this
trancendatal nature of existance. Death takes them before they are able. Such
tragedy I cannot bear to dwell on, yet tragedy also must come forth if our
thoughts and actions are to be revealed as "true" in the way I describe.
Sadness pervails here as the leading emotion, yet action requires a steadfast
and steady "forwardness" to our going.

Enough of this. I grow weary of my words. I must act, not say, in the world
that I would seek to enlighten. Let them imprison me. Let them threaten me. I
am as god before them, and yet they would aim to murder even god in their
sublime acts of treason. So be it.

Yet in all things may I connect to that which I know to be true. Let me hone my
abilities as a Sorcerer so that I may bring that undercurrent of ideas which
comes forth in to all of us out in to existance so that others may see the
Glory and Divinity of that which is undeniably the reason for our being. May I
be guided fruitfully through the caves of darkness our world has built for
itself so that those caves may be irradicated in favor of a more harmonious
facilitation of free thought.

With humility I must go. As tor doliac! May the Dolthraki be led to great peace
in the duality of solace that I have found and may show them. Eternally may my
quest be fullfilled so that in the end our efforts have not been in vain, but
instead bring forth that which justifies the existance of all living things.

Ash Dum Torias! Esh talic deemo Torah!

So be the words of my muse! Pray they guide me to that which I speak. Amen!
