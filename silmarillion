        Quotes
            Now all is said concerning the manner of the Earth and its rulers
            in the beginning of days, and ere the world became such as the
            Children of Iluvatar have known it. For Elves and Men are the
            Children of Iluvatar; and since they understood not fully that
            theme by which the Children entered into the Music, none of the
            Ainur dared to add anything to their fashion. For which reason the
            Valar are to these kindreds rather their elders and their
            chieftains than their masters; and if ever in their dealings with
            Elves and Men the Ainur have endeavoured to force them when they
            would not be guided, seldom has this turned to good, howsoever good
            the intent. The dealings of the Ainur have indeed been mostly with
            the Elves, for Iluvatar made them more like in nature to the Ainur,
            though less in might and stature; whereas to Men he gave strange
            gifts.
