    Eru
        the One
        Ilúvatar
    Ainur
        the Holy Ones
            Ainulindale: There was Eru, the One, who in Arda is called
            Iluvatar; and he made first the Ainur, the Holy Ones, that were the
            offspring of his thought, and they were with him before aught else
            was made.
    Melkor
        Named Morgoth by the Elves

        Ainulindale: To Melkor among the Ainur had been given the greatest
        gifts of power and knowledge, and he had a share in all the gifts of
        his brethren. He had gone often alone into the void places seeking the
        Imperishable Flame; for desire grew hot within him to bring into Being
        things of his own, and it seemed to him that Ilúvatar took no thought
        for the Void, and he was impatient of its emptiness. Yet he found not
        the Fire, for it is with Ilúvatar. But being alone he had begun to
        conceive thoughts of his own unlike those of his brethren.
    Gorthaur
        Gorthaur the Cruel
        Named Sauron by the Children of Iluvatar

        Valaquenta: In all the deeds of Melkor the Morgoth upon Arda, in his
        vast works and in the deceits of his cunning, Sauron had a part, and
        was only less evil than his master in that for long he served another
        and not himself.  But in after years he rose like a shadow of Morgoth
        and a ghost of his malice, and walked behind him on the same ruinous
        path down into the Void.
    Valar
        Manwë
            Lord of the Breath of Arda
            Súlimo he is surnamed
            With Manwë dwells Varda
            Oiolossë, the uttermost tower of Taniquetil, where Manwe and Varda dwell

            Valaquenta: The mightiest of those Ainur who came into the World
            was in his beginning Melkor; but Manwë is dearest to Ilúvatar and
            understands most clearly his purposes.
        Ulmo
            Lord of Waters
            Ulumúri, great horns of Ulmo
                Valaquenta: At times he win come unseen to the shores of
                Middle-earth, or pass far inland up firths of the sea, and
                there make music upon his great horns, the Ulumúri, that are
                wrought of white shell; and those to whom that music comes hear
                it ever after in their hearts, and longing for the sea never
                leaves them again.

            Valaquenta: If the Children of Eru beheld him they were filled with
            a great dread; for the arising of the King of the Sea was terrible,
            as a mounting wave that strides to the land, with dark helm
            foam-crested and raiment of mail shimmering from silver down into
            shadows of green.
        Aulë
            Lord over all substance of which Arda is made
            The spouse of Aulë is Yavanna

            Valaquenta: He is a smith and a master of all crafts, and he
            delights in works of skill, however small, as much as in the mighty
            building of old. His are the gems that lie deep in the Earth and
            the gold that is fair in the hand, no less than the walls of the
            mountains and the basins of the sea.
        Oromë
            Called Aldaron, Lord of the Forest
            Called Tauron by the Sindar
            Nahar, his Horse
            Valaróma, his great horn
            The spouse of Oromë is Vána

            Valaquenta: Oromë loved the lands of Middle-earth, and he left them
            unwillingly and came last to Valinor; and often of old he passed
            back east over the mountains and returned with his host to the
            hills and the plains. He is a hunter of monsters and fell beasts,
            and he delights in horses and in hounds; and all trees he loves,
            for which reason he is called Aldaron, and by the Sindar Tauron,
            the Lord of Forests.
        Fëanturi
            Masters of Spirits
            Mandos
                Námo
                    Keeper of the Houses of the Dead
                    Vairë the Weaver is his spouse

                    Valaquenta: He forgets nothing; and he knows all things
                    that shall be, save only those that lie still in the
                    freedom of Ilúvatar. He is the Doomsman of the Valar; but
                    he pronounces his dooms and his Judgements only at the
                    bidding of Manwë.
            Lórien
                Irmo
                    Master of visions and dreams
                    Estë the gentle is his spouse

                Valaquenta: From the fountains of Irmo and Estë all those
                who dwell in Valinor draw refreshment; and often the Valar
                come themselves to Lórien and there find repose and easing
                of the burden of Arda.

            Valaquenta: The Fëanturi, masters of spirits, are brethren, and
            they are called most often Mandos and Lórien. Yet these are rightly
            the names of the places of their dwelling, and their true names are
            Námo and Irmo.
        Tulkas
            Astaldo, the Valiant, he is surnamed
            His spouse is Nessa

            Valaquenta: He delights in wrestling and in contests of strength;
            and he rides no steed, for he can outrun all things that go on
            feet, and he is tireless. His hair and beard are golden, and his
            flesh ruddy; his weapons are his hands.

        Ainulindale: But this condition Ilúvatar made, or it is the necessity
        of their love, that their power should thenceforward be contained and
        bounded in the World, to be within it for ever, until it is complete,
        so that they are its life and it is theirs. And therefore they are
        named the Valar, the Powers of the World.
    Valier
        Varda
            Lady of the Stars
            Elbereth the elves name her
            With Manwë dwells Varda
            Oiolossë, the uttermost tower of Taniquetil, where Manwe and Varda dwell

            Valaquenta: With Manwë dwells Varda, Lady of the Stars, who knows
            all the regions of Eä.
            Valaquenta: Of all the Great Ones who dwell in this world the Elves
            hold Varda most in reverence and love. Elbereth they name her, and
            they call upon her name out of the shadows of Middle-earth, and
            uplift it in song at the rising of the stars.
        Yavanna
            The Giver of Fruits
            The spouse of Aulë is Yavanna
            Kementári, Queen of the Earth, she is surnamed in the Eldarin tongue.

            Valaquenta: In reverence Yavanna is next to Varda among the Queens
            of the Valar. In the form of a woman she is tall, and robed in
            green; but at times she takes other shapes. Some there are who have
            seen her standing like a tree under heaven, crowned with the Sun;
            and from all its branches there spilled a golden dew upon the
            barren earth, and it grew green with corn; but the roots of the
            tree were in the waters of Ulmo, and the winds of Manwë spoke in
            its leaves.
        Nienna
            Sister of the Fëanturi

            Valaquenta: Her halls are west of West, upon the borders of the
            world; and she comes seldom to the city of Valimar where all is
            glad. She goes rather to the halls of Mandos, which are near to her
            own; and all those who wait in Mandos cry to her, for she brings
            strength to the spirit and turns sorrow to wisdom. The windows of
            her house look outward from the walls of the world.
        Estë
            Estë the gentle, healer of hurts and of weariness, is Irmo's spouse.
            Lórellin, a lake in Lorien where Este sleeps
        Vairë
            The Weaver
            Spouse of Námo the elder in Mandos
        Vána
            The Ever-young
            Younger sister of Yavanna
            Spouse of Orome

            Valaquenta: All flowers spring as she passes and open if she
            glances upon them; and all birds sing at her coming.
        Nessa
            Spouse of Tulkas
            Sister of Orome

            Valaquenta: Deer she loves, and they follow her train whenever she
            goes in the wild; but she can outrun them, swift as an arrow with
            the wind in her hair. In dancing she delights, and she dances in
            Valimar on lawns of never-fading green.
    Maiar
        Ilmarë
            Handmaid of Varda
        Eönwë
            Banner-bearer and herald of Manwe
        Ossë
            Vassal of Ulmo
            His spouse is Uinen

            Valaquenta: He does not go in the deeps, but loves the coasts and
            the isles, and rejoices in the winds of Manwë; for in storm he
            delights, and laughs amid the roaring of the waves.
        Uinen
            Lady of the Seas
            Spouse of Osse

            Valaquenta: All creatures she loves that live in the salt streams,
            and all weeds that grow there; to her mariners cry, for she can lay
            calm upon the waves, restraining the wildness of Ossë. The
            Númenóreans lived long in her protection, and held her in reverence
            equal to the Valar.
        Melian
            Lady of Lorien
            Serving both Vana and Este

            Valaquenta: Melian was the name of a Maia who served both Vána and
            Estë; she dwelt long in Lórien, tending the trees that flower in
            the gardens of Irmo, ere she came to Middle-earth. Nightingales
            sang about her wherever she went.
        Olorin
            Wisest of the Maiar

            Valaquenta: Wisest of the Maiar was Olórin. He too dwelt in Lórien,
            but his ways took him often to the house of Nienna, and of her he
            learned pity and patience.

            Valaquenta: But of Olórin that tale does not speak; for though he
            loved the Elves, he walked among them unseen, or in form as one of
            them, and they did not know whence came the fair visions or the
            promptings of wisdom that he put into their hearts. In later days
            he was the friend of all the Children of Ilúvatar, and took pity on
            their sorrows; and those who listened to him awoke from despair and
            put away the imaginations of darkness.
List of Places
    Arda
    Eä
        Ainulindale: And suddenly the Ainur saw afar off a light, as it were a
        cloud with a living heart of flame; and they knew that this was no
        vision only, but that Ilúvatar had made a new thing: Eä, the World that
        Is.
    Valinor
        Taniquetil
            Oiolossë, where Manwe and Varda dwell
                Valaquenta: Their halls are above the everlasting snow, upon
                Oiolossë, the uttermost tower of Taniquetil, tallest of all the
                mountains upon Earth. When Manwë there ascends his throne and
                looks forth, if Varda is beside him, he sees further than all
                other eyes, through mist, and through darkness, and over the
                leagues of the sea. And if Manwë is with her, Varda hears more
                clearly than all other ears the sound of voices that cry from
                east to west, from the hills and the valleys, and from the dark
                places that Melkor has made upon Earth.

        Quotes
            Now all is said concerning the manner of the Earth and its rulers
            in the beginning of days, and ere the world became such as the
            Children of Iluvatar have known it. For Elves and Men are the
            Children of Iluvatar; and since they understood not fully that
            theme by which the Children entered into the Music, none of the
            Ainur dared to add anything to their fashion. For which reason the
            Valar are to these kindreds rather their elders and their
            chieftains than their masters; and if ever in their dealings with
            Elves and Men the Ainur have endeavoured to force them when they
            would not be guided, seldom has this turned to good, howsoever good
            the intent. The dealings of the Ainur have indeed been mostly with
            the Elves, for Iluvatar made them more like in nature to the Ainur,
            though less in might and stature; whereas to Men he gave strange
            gifts.
