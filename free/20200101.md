This is something that I wanted to try again. I want to attempt to write in the
form of a 80 line document.

Something I have not tried in a long time is doing the Wim Hof method and
writing out what I feel as I am doing it. Let's do that.

Begin.

I am not at the exkhase portior of my sesession. This is me holding my breath
and remaining very calm for some seconds. How many seconds I do not know, but
it is seconds none the less. Indeed, seconds are happenening and I am inhaling
now.

This is anothir pause. Anothr pause to write dowr what it is I am experiencing
at this moment. Something profound is happenenig. It is as if the words are
tethering me to reality, but reality is somehow less real than the sensation
that I am feeling at the moment.

I feel light yet I feel nothing at all. It is as if the act of typing brings
physical pain to me.

I am surprisingly unmotivated to write. So be it.
