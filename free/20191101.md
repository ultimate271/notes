And so it begins. It's been a long time since I have done freewriting like this
and I must say that it feels in some way resolutely discouraging. This is not
the medium by which thought should be placed on to specific medium. This
transferance of media does not prohibit itself well towards well formed
thought. I must stop myself from doing this lest I become angry at myself for
writing in this way.
