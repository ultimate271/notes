So last night I had a dream. This was more of a dream fragment than a dream.

This fragment takes place in a theater. It is a large theater, and has a stage
(i.e. not a movie theater but an actual theater theater.)

It has multiple wings which form a semi-arc around the stage, along with
multiple tiers. The dream takes place on the right side of the theater near the
top of the first tier.

The fragment starts just before the show is to start, and everyone is finding
their seats. I find mine, and see that it is in a section that is four chairs
wide. I take me seat on the third seat and notice that the chairs next to me
are empty. I am happy about this and hope that it will remain empty.

Unfortunately, someone comes and sits in the chair on either side of mine. The
person to the right is calm but the person on the left chair is spreading
himself out to intrude upon my space. I try to make a barrier for him with my
own body, but he continues to be beligerent. At some point, when this back and
forth has persisted for an obnoxious amount of time (more than twenty seconds).
I get up and confront him directly. This disturbs the people in front and
behind, but I am not concerned about them. I make the point that he can't be
intruding upon other people's space, not generally and especially not because
of the virus.

This is about the extent of the dream that I remember.
