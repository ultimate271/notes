So last night I had a couple of dream fragments.

The first involved me working at a gift shop an an observatory. I am new there
(I am new at Target irl right now) and I am instructed how to help customers
when they ask for it.

One customer comes by and asks me for something, and I am immediately able to
help them find it. My manager smiles and is happy that I am able to catch on so
quickly.

Another customer comes and wants a fuck load of stuff. I help him find it and
basically begin checking all of our inventory and just throwing it into his
cart.

That was all I really remember about this.

The other dream fragment, I don't really remember now. I do remember that it
was much less visual and much more visceral, but I don't remember in what way.
I wish I could remember it.

That is all.
