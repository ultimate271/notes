        Syntactical Summary
            Frodo takes a role similar to Bilbo's in the decades after the dissappearance.
            Frodo begins to notice uneasiness around him, but is unable to ascertain exactly what in the bubble of the Shire.
            Sam speaks in a pub about the comings and goings in the shire.
            Gandalf returns to the shire after 9 years absence.
            Gandalf begins to warn Frodo of the power of The Ring.
            Gandalf recounts what he knows of the Battle of Five Armies, to Gollum to Bilbo to his disscussions with Saruman
            Gandalf throws the ring in the fire.
            The characteristic poem, Gandalf reads the inscription and knows this is the one ring.
            Gandalf begins the lore, from Gil-galad to Gollums acquisition.
            Gandalf tells of tracking Gollum, questioning him for information, and of gollums travels to Mordor
            Gandalf tells of Gollum revealing his actions to the dark lord, and announces to Frodo that the ring must be cast to Mordor.
            Frodo resolves at the very least to protect the ring, and they catch Sam eavesdropping in the garden.
        Quotes
            A mortal, Frodo, who keeps one of the Great Rings, does not die,
            but he does not grow or obtain more life, he merely continues,
            until at last every minute is a weariness. And if he often uses the
            Ring to make himself invisible, he fades: he becomes in the end
            invisible permanently, and walks in the twilight under the eye of
            the dark power that rules the Rings. Yes, sooner or later - later,
            if he is strong or well-meaning to begin with, but neither strength
            nor good purpose will last - sooner or later the dark power will
            devour him.

            'I wish it need not have happened in my time,' said Frodo.
            'So do I,' said Gandalf, 'and so do all who live to see such times.
            But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what
            to do with the time that is given us. And already, Frodo, our time
            is beginning to look black. The Enemy is fast becoming very strong.
            His plans are far from ripe, I think, but they are ripening. We
            shall be hard put to it. We should be very hard put to it, even if
            it were not for this dreadful chance.

            '...What a pity that Bilbo did not stab that vile creature when he
            had the chance!'
            'Pity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and Mercy: not to
            strike without need. And he has been well rewarded, Frodo. Be sure
            that he took so little hurt from the evil, and escaped in the end,
            because he began his ownership of the Ring so. With Pity.'
            'I am sorry,' said Frodo. 'But I am frightened; and I do not feel
            any pity for Gollum.'
            'You have not seen him,' Gandalf broke in.
            'No, and I don't want to,' said Frodo. I can't understand you. Do
            you mean to say that you, and the Elves, have let him live on after
            all those horrible deeds? Now at any rate he is as bad as an Orc,
            and just an enemy. He deserves death.'
            'Deserves it! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And
            some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be
            too eager to deal out death in judgement. For even the very wise
            cannot see all ends. I have not much hope that Gollum can be cured
            before he dies, but there is a chance of it. And he is bound up
            with the fate of the Ring. My heart tells me that he has some part
            to play yet, for good or ill, before the end; and when that comes,
            the pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many - yours not least. In
            any case we did not kill him: he is very old and very wretched. The
            Wood-elves have him in prison, but they treat him with such
            kindness as they can find in their wise hearts.'

                of the Shire far away, no of the dark shadows and perils
                that encompassed them, but of the fair things they had seen
                in the world together, of the Elves, of the stars,
                of trees, and the gentle fall of the bright year in the woods.
