        Syntactical Summary
            Frodo takes a role similar to Bilbo's in the decades after the dissappearance.
            Frodo begins to notice uneasiness around him, but is unable to ascertain exactly what in the bubble of the Shire.
            Sam speaks in a pub about the comings and goings in the shire.
            Gandalf returns to the shire after 9 years absence.
            Gandalf begins to warn Frodo of the power of The Ring.
            Gandalf recounts what he knows of the Battle of Five Armies, to Gollum to Bilbo to his disscussions with Saruman
            Gandalf throws the ring in the fire.
            The characteristic poem, Gandalf reads the inscription and knows this is the one ring.
            Gandalf begins the lore, from Gil-galad to Gollums acquisition.
            Gandalf tells of tracking Gollum, questioning him for information, and of gollums travels to Mordor
            Gandalf tells of Gollum revealing his actions to the dark lord, and announces to Frodo that the ring must be cast to Mordor.
            Frodo resolves at the very least to protect the ring, and they catch Sam eavesdropping in the garden.
        Quotes
            A mortal, Frodo, who keeps one of the Great Rings, does not die,
            but he does not grow or obtain more life, he merely continues,
            until at last every minute is a weariness. And if he often uses the
            Ring to make himself invisible, he fades: he becomes in the end
            invisible permanently, and walks in the twilight under the eye of
            the dark power that rules the Rings. Yes, sooner or later - later,
            if he is strong or well-meaning to begin with, but neither strength
            nor good purpose will last - sooner or later the dark power will
            devour him.

            'I wish it need not have happened in my time,' said Frodo.
            'So do I,' said Gandalf, 'and so do all who live to see such times.
            But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what
            to do with the time that is given us. And already, Frodo, our time
            is beginning to look black. The Enemy is fast becoming very strong.
            His plans are far from ripe, I think, but they are ripening. We
            shall be hard put to it. We should be very hard put to it, even if
            it were not for this dreadful chance.

            '...What a pity that Bilbo did not stab that vile creature when he
            had the chance!'
            'Pity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and Mercy: not to
            strike without need. And he has been well rewarded, Frodo. Be sure
            that he took so little hurt from the evil, and escaped in the end,
            because he began his ownership of the Ring so. With Pity.'
            'I am sorry,' said Frodo. 'But I am frightened; and I do not feel
            any pity for Gollum.'
            'You have not seen him,' Gandalf broke in.
            'No, and I don't want to,' said Frodo. I can't understand you. Do
            you mean to say that you, and the Elves, have let him live on after
            all those horrible deeds? Now at any rate he is as bad as an Orc,
            and just an enemy. He deserves death.'
            'Deserves it! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And
            some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be
            too eager to deal out death in judgement. For even the very wise
            cannot see all ends. I have not much hope that Gollum can be cured
            before he dies, but there is a chance of it. And he is bound up
            with the fate of the Ring. My heart tells me that he has some part
            to play yet, for good or ill, before the end; and when that comes,
            the pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many - yours not least. In
            any case we did not kill him: he is very old and very wretched. The
            Wood-elves have him in prison, but they treat him with such
            kindness as they can find in their wise hearts.'

Gimli and Legolas appear to find Aragorn over Boromir, and the three place his body in a boat and leave his fate to the river Anduin. After singing songs in Boromir's memory, the trio pieces together the puzzle of the hobbits, and they resolve to find Merry and Pippin and leave Frodo and Sam to their quest.
        Quotes
            'I have not seen these tokens before,' said Aragorn. 'What do they
            mean?'
            'S is for Sauron,' said Gimli. 'That is easy to read.'
            'Nay!' said Legolas. 'Sauron does not use the Elf-runes.'
            'Neither does he use his right name, nor permit it to be spelt or
            spoken,' said Aragorn. 'And he does not use white. The Orcs in the
            service of Barad-dur use the sign of the Red Eye.' He stood for a
            moment in thought. 'S is for Saruman, I guess,' he said at length.
            'There is evil afoot in Isengard, and the West is no longer safe.
            It is as Gandalf feared: by some means the traitor Saruman has had
            news of our journey. It is likely too that he knows of Gandalf's
            fall. Pursuers from Moria may have escaped the vigilance of Lorien,
            or they may have avoided that land and come to Isengard by other
            paths. Orcs travel fast. But Saruman has many ways of learning
            news.'

            'But why should he leave us behind, and without a word?' said
            Gimli. 'That was a strange deed!'
            'And a brave deed,' said Aragorn.  'Sam was right, I think. Frodo
            did not wish to lead any friend to death with him in Mordor. But he
            knew that he must go himself.  Something happened after he left us
            that overcame his fear and doubt.'
            'Maybe hunting Orcs came on him and he fled,' said Legolas.
            'He fled, certainly,' said Aragorn, 'but not, I think, from Orcs.'
            What he thought was the cause of Frodo's sudden resolve and flight
            Aragorn did not say. The last words of Boromir he long kept secret.

            'Let me think!' said Aragorn. 'And now may I make a right choice
            and change the evil fate of this unhappy day!' He stood silent for
            a moment. 'I will follow the Orcs,' he said at last. 'I would have
            guided Frodo to Mordor and gone with him to the end; but if I seek
            him now in the wilderness, I must abandon the captives to torment
            and death. My heart speaks clearly at last: the fate of the Bearer
            is in my hands no longer. The Company has played its part. Yet we
            that remain cannot forsake our companions while we have strength
            left. Come! We will go now. Leave all that can be spared behind! We
            will press on by day and dark!'

        Syntactical Summary
            The trio continues chasing the trail of the orcs. On the trail, they find many things: first, 5 dead orcs, then hobbit footprints which Aragorn identifies as Pippens, then Legolas spots an Eagle headed northward in the sky, and lastly, queer emptiness in Eastemnet. They elect to rest a night, and have been at their chase for three days.
            The trio continues their chase, wearily but steadily. They find some more signs of Orcs, but begin to lose hope as they realize that the orcs have not rested as much as they.
            The trio spots the Riders of Rohan coming from the trail of Orcs, and hail their intersection. They have a tense introduction, and begin to exchange their tales.
            As Aragorn and Eomer continue to converse, they decide to each go their seperate ways, as Eomer lends the trio horses to aid in their quest to find the hobbits, with the garuntee that they will be returned so that the trio may fight alongside the riders in the war to come.
            The trio continues on their quest to find the hobbits. The find the place of battle where the orc's were slain, and begin to belabour that the hobbits could have died in the fight. In the night, a wizard is seen in the distance, but before they can approach and identify him, the trio realizes their horses have fled.
            The trio looks for the horses or the wizard (suspecting Saruman) in vain, and resolve to continue on without finding either goal.
        Quotes
            The sun was sinking when at lost they drew near to the end of the
            line of downs. For many hours they had marched without rest. They
            were going slowly now, and Gimli's back was bent. Stone-hard are
            the Dwarves in labour or journey, but this endless chase began to
            tell on him, as all hope failed in his heart. Aragorn walked behind
            him, grim and silent, stooping now and again to scan some print or
            mark upon the ground. Only legolas still stepped as lightly as
            ever, his feet hardly seeming to press the grass, leaving no
            footprints as he passed; but in the waybread of the Elves he found
            all the sustenance that he needed, and he could sleep, if sleep it
            could be called by Men, resting his mind in the strange paths of
            elvish dreams, even as he walked open-eyed in the light of this
            world.

            'What do you know of these horsemen, Aragorn?' he said. 'Do we sit
            here waiting for sudden death?'
            'I have been among them,' answered Aragorn. 'They are proud and
            willful, but they are true-hearted, generous in thought and deed;
            bold but not cruel; wise but unlearned, writing no books but
            singing many songs, after the manner of the children of Men before
            the Dark Years. But I do not know what has happened here of late,
            nor in what mind the Rohirrim may now be between the traitor
            Saruman and the threat of Sauron. They have long been the friends
            of the people of Gondor, though they are not akin to them. It was
            in forgotten years long ago that Eorl the Young brought them out of
            the North, and their kinship is rather with the Bardings of Dale,
            and with the Beornings of the Wood, among whom may still be seen
            many men tall and fair, as are the Riders of Rohan. At least they
            will not love the Orcs.'

            Aragorn threw back his cloak. The elven-sheath glittered as he
            grasped it, and the bright blade of Anduril shone like a sudden
            flame as he swept it out. 'Elendil!' he cried. 'I am Aragorn son of
            Arathorn and am called Elessar, the Elfstone, Dunadan, the heir of
            Isildur Elendil's son of Gondor. Here is the Sword that was Broken
            and is forged again! Will you aid me or thwart me? Choose swiftly!'

            'All that you say is strange, Aragorn.' he said. 'Yet you speak the
            truth, that is plain: the Men of the Mark do not lie, and therefore
            they are not easily deceived. But you have not told all. Will you
            not now speak more fully of your errand, so that I may judge what
            you do?'

            'We can do no more,' said Gimli sadly. 'We have been set many
            riddles since we came to Tol Brandir, but this is the hardest to
            unravel. I would guess that the burned bones of the hobbits are now
            mungled with the Orcs. It will be hard news for Frodo, if he lives
            to hear it; and hard too for the old hobbit who waits in Rivendell.
            Elrond was against their coming.'
            'But Gandalf was not,' said Legolas.
            'But Gandalf chose to come himself, and he was the first to be
            lost' answered Gimli. 'His foresight failed him.'
            'The counsel of Gandalf was not founded on foreknowledge of safety,
            for himself or for others,' said Aragorn. 'There are some things
            that it is better to begin than to refuse, even though the end may
            be dark. But I shall not depart from this place yet. In any case we
            must here await the morning-light.'

            Pippen wakes from a nightmare and recollects the events leading to their capture
            The Urak-Hai is introduced as a ravenous group of orcs from many regions. Pippen secretly loosens his bonds.
            The orcs march west towards Isengard.
            The orcs untie the hobbits, and Pippen fakes an escape attempt to leave behind visible hobbit footprints.
            The orcs realize they are being followed by white skins, and converse of their options
            The orcs continue on the road, getting in position to fight.
            Merry and Pippen observe the riders.
            Night arrives with a little unrest but no war.
            Pippen senses Grishnakh's desire for the ring, and baits him into bringing them away from the orcs.
            Merry and Pippen count there blessings and continue to run.
            The hobbits escape to the forest Fangorn as Eomer and his riders overtake and acheive victory over the orcs.
        Quotes
            So it was that they did not see the last stand, when Ugluk was
            overtaken and brought to bay at the very edge of Fangorn. There he
            was slain at last by Eomer, the Third Marshal of the Mark, who
            dismounted and fought him sword to sword. And over the wide fields
            the keen-eyed Riders hunted down the few Orcs that had escaped and
            still had strength to fly.
            Then when they had laid their fallen comrades in a mound and had
            sung their praises, the Riders made a great fire and scattered the
            ashes of their enemies. So ended the raid, and no news of it came
            ever back either to Mordor or to Isengard; but th esmoke of the
            burning rose high to heaven and was seen by many watchful eyes.

            Pippen and Merry wander in Fangorn a bit, and find a clearing in the trees
            The hobbits find the way to the clearing harder than they first thought.
            Treebeard reveals himself to the hobbits, and they become acquainted, the hobbits sharing their story of Gandalf and the orcs of Isengard to Treebeard.
            Treebeard tells a bit about Ents to the hobbits as he carries them to an Entish home.
            The group arrives at an Enthouse
            Treebeard shows them around and shares some water, in preparation to begin his tales.
            The hobbits recall their tale in detail, and then Treebeard talks of the Great War, of Saruman, and corses the betrayal of his dark union with the orcs.
            Treebeard begins to stage his uprising, before getting distracted telling the hobbits of the entwives
            Treebeard sings of the entwives
            They rest and wake to prepare for the "Entmoot", the gathering of the Ents.
            The entmoot begins, but the Hobbits become bored listening to the laborious entish language.
            The hobbits grow impatient, and treebeard assigns Bregalad (Quickbeam) to keep them company while the Ents finish the Moot. Quickbeams tells a bit of his story.
            The Ents finish their Moot, and begin their rally cries.
            A rally song
            Talk of the fight the Ents are preparing for.
            They begin their march to Isengard throught the forest.
        Quotes
            Often afterwards Pippen tried to describe his first impression of
            them. [Treebeards eyes]
            'One felt as if there was an enormous well behind them, filled up
            with ages of memory and long, slow, steady thinking; but their
            surface was sparkling with the the present; like sun shimmering on
            the outer leaves of a vast tree, or on the ripples of a very deep
            lake. I don't know, but it felt as if something that grew in the
            ground - asleep, you might say, or just feeling itself as
            something bettween root-tip and leaf-tip, between deep earth and
            sky had suddenly waked up, and was considering you with the same
            slow care that it had given to its own inside affairs for endless
            years.'

        Quotes
            'No, no!' said Gollum. 'No use. We can't go further. Smeagol said
            so. He said: we'll go to the Gate, and then we'll see. And we do
            see. O yes, my precious, we do see. Smeagol knew hobbits could not
            go this way. O yes. Smeagol knew'
            'Then what the plague did you bring us here for?' said Sam, not
            feeling in the mood to be just or reasonable.
            'Master said so. Master says: Bring us to the Gate. So good Smeagol
            does so. Master said so, wise master.'
            'I did,' said Frodo. His face was grim and set, but resolute. He
            was filthy, haggard, and punched with weariness, but he cowered no
            longer, and his eyes were clear. 'I said so, because I purpose to
            enter Mordor, and I know no other way. Therefore I shall go this
            way. I do not ask anyone to go with me.'

            'Smeagol,' he [Frodo] said, 'I will trust you once more. Indeed it
            seems that I must do so, and that it is my fate to receive help
            from you where I least looked for it, and your fate to help me whom
            you long pursued with evil purpose. So far you have deserved well
            of me and have kept your promise truly. Truly, I say and mean,' he
            added with a glance at Sam, 'for twice now we have been in your
            power, and you have done no harm to us. Nor have you tried to take
            from me what you once sought. May the third time prove the best!
            But I warn you, Smeagol, you are in danger.'
            'Yes, yes, master!' said Gollum. 'Dreadful danger! Smeagol's bones
            shake to think of it but he dosn't run away. He must help nice
            master.'
            'I did not mean the danger that we all share,' said Frodo. 'I mean
            a danger to yourself alone. You swore a promise by what you call
            the Precious. Remember that! It will hold you to it; but it will
            seek a way to twist it to your own undoing. Already you are being
            twisted. You revealed yourself to me just now, foolishly. Give it
            back to Smeagol you said. Do not say that again! Do nat let that
            thought grow in you! You will never get it back. But the desire of
            it may betray you to a bitter end. You will never get it back. In
            the last need, Smeagol, I should put on the Precious; and the
            Precious mastered you long ago. If I, wearing it, were to command
            you, you would obey, even if it were to leap from a precipice or to
            cast yourself into the fire. And such would be my command. So have
            a care, Smeagol!'
