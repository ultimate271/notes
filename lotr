        Quotes
            And that is another reason why the Ring should be destroyed;
                as long as it is in the world it will be a danger
                even to the Wise.
                For nothing is evil in the beginning.
                Even Sauron was not so.

        Quotes
            'You cannot pass,' [Gandalf] said. The orcs stood still, and a dead
                silence fell. 'I am a servent of the Secret Fire,
                wielder of the flame of Anor. You cannot pass.
                The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun.
                Go back to the Shadow! You cannot pass.'
