        Syntactical Summary
            Frodo takes a role similar to Bilbo's in the decades after the dissappearance.
            Frodo begins to notice uneasiness around him, but is unable to ascertain exactly what in the bubble of the Shire.
            Sam speaks in a pub about the comings and goings in the shire.
            Gandalf returns to the shire after 9 years absence.
            Gandalf begins to warn Frodo of the power of The Ring.
            Gandalf recounts what he knows of the Battle of Five Armies, to Gollum to Bilbo to his disscussions with Saruman
            Gandalf throws the ring in the fire.
            The characteristic poem, Gandalf reads the inscription and knows this is the one ring.
            Gandalf begins the lore, from Gil-galad to Gollums acquisition.
            Gandalf tells of tracking Gollum, questioning him for information, and of gollums travels to Mordor
            Gandalf tells of Gollum revealing his actions to the dark lord, and announces to Frodo that the ring must be cast to Mordor.
            Frodo resolves at the very least to protect the ring, and they catch Sam eavesdropping in the garden.
        Quotes
            A mortal, Frodo, who keeps one of the Great Rings, does not die,
            but he does not grow or obtain more life, he merely continues,
            until at last every minute is a weariness. And if he often uses the
            Ring to make himself invisible, he fades: he becomes in the end
            invisible permanently, and walks in the twilight under the eye of
            the dark power that rules the Rings. Yes, sooner or later - later,
            if he is strong or well-meaning to begin with, but neither strength
            nor good purpose will last - sooner or later the dark power will
            devour him.

            'I wish it need not have happened in my time,' said Frodo.
            'So do I,' said Gandalf, 'and so do all who live to see such times.
            But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what
            to do with the time that is given us. And already, Frodo, our time
            is beginning to look black. The Enemy is fast becoming very strong.
            His plans are far from ripe, I think, but they are ripening. We
            shall be hard put to it. We should be very hard put to it, even if
            it were not for this dreadful chance.

            '...What a pity that Bilbo did not stab that vile creature when he
            had the chance!'
            'Pity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and Mercy: not to
            strike without need. And he has been well rewarded, Frodo. Be sure
            that he took so little hurt from the evil, and escaped in the end,
            because he began his ownership of the Ring so. With Pity.'
            'I am sorry,' said Frodo. 'But I am frightened; and I do not feel
            any pity for Gollum.'
            'You have not seen him,' Gandalf broke in.
            'No, and I don't want to,' said Frodo. I can't understand you. Do
            you mean to say that you, and the Elves, have let him live on after
            all those horrible deeds? Now at any rate he is as bad as an Orc,
            and just an enemy. He deserves death.'
            'Deserves it! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And
            some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be
            too eager to deal out death in judgement. For even the very wise
            cannot see all ends. I have not much hope that Gollum can be cured
            before he dies, but there is a chance of it. And he is bound up
            with the fate of the Ring. My heart tells me that he has some part
            to play yet, for good or ill, before the end; and when that comes,
            the pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many - yours not least. In
            any case we did not kill him: he is very old and very wretched. The
            Wood-elves have him in prison, but they treat him with such
            kindness as they can find in their wise hearts.'

Gimli and Legolas appear to find Aragorn over Boromir, and the three place his body in a boat and leave his fate to the river Anduin. After singing songs in Boromir's memory, the trio pieces together the puzzle of the hobbits, and they resolve to find Merry and Pippin and leave Frodo and Sam to their quest.
        Quotes
            'I have not seen these tokens before,' said Aragorn. 'What do they
            mean?'
            'S is for Sauron,' said Gimli. 'That is easy to read.'
            'Nay!' said Legolas. 'Sauron does not use the Elf-runes.'
            'Neither does he use his right name, nor permit it to be spelt or
            spoken,' said Aragorn. 'And he does not use white. The Orcs in the
            service of Barad-dur use the sign of the Red Eye.' He stood for a
            moment in thought. 'S is for Saruman, I guess,' he said at length.
            'There is evil afoot in Isengard, and the West is no longer safe.
            It is as Gandalf feared: by some means the traitor Saruman has had
            news of our journey. It is likely too that he knows of Gandalf's
            fall. Pursuers from Moria may have escaped the vigilance of Lorien,
            or they may have avoided that land and come to Isengard by other
            paths. Orcs travel fast. But Saruman has many ways of learning
            news.'

            'But why should he leave us behind, and without a word?' said
            Gimli. 'That was a strange deed!'
            'And a brave deed,' said Aragorn.  'Sam was right, I think. Frodo
            did not wish to lead any friend to death with him in Mordor. But he
            knew that he must go himself.  Something happened after he left us
            that overcame his fear and doubt.'
            'Maybe hunting Orcs came on him and he fled,' said Legolas.
            'He fled, certainly,' said Aragorn, 'but not, I think, from Orcs.'
            What he thought was the cause of Frodo's sudden resolve and flight
            Aragorn did not say. The last words of Boromir he long kept secret.

            'Let me think!' said Aragorn. 'And now may I make a right choice
            and change the evil fate of this unhappy day!' He stood silent for
            a moment. 'I will follow the Orcs,' he said at last. 'I would have
            guided Frodo to Mordor and gone with him to the end; but if I seek
            him now in the wilderness, I must abandon the captives to torment
            and death. My heart speaks clearly at last: the fate of the Bearer
            is in my hands no longer. The Company has played its part. Yet we
            that remain cannot forsake our companions while we have strength
            left. Come! We will go now. Leave all that can be spared behind! We
            will press on by day and dark!'

            Pippen and Merry wander in Fangorn a bit, and find a clearing in the trees
            The hobbits find the way to the clearing harder than they first thought.
            Treebeard reveals himself to the hobbits, and they become acquainted, the hobbits sharing their story of Gandalf and the orcs of Isengard to Treebeard.

            Treebeard shows them around and shares some water, in preparation to begin his tales.
            The hobbits recall their tale in detail, and then Treebeard talks of the Great War, of Saruman, and corses the betrayal of his dark union with the orcs.
            Treebeard begins to stage his uprising, before getting distracted telling the hobbits of the entwives
            Treebeard sings of the entwives
            They rest and wake to prepare for the "Entmoot", the gathering of the Ents.
            The entmoot begins, but the Hobbits become bored listening to the laborious entish language.

            Talk of the fight the Ents are preparing for.
            They begin their march to Isengard throught the forest.
        Quotes
            Often afterwards Pippen tried to describe his first impression of
            them. [Treebeards eyes]
            'One felt as if there was an enormous well behind them, filled up
            with ages of memory and long, slow, steady thinking; but their
            surface was sparkling with the the present; like sun shimmering on
            the outer leaves of a vast tree, or on the ripples of a very deep
            lake. I don't know, but it felt as if something that grew in the
            ground - asleep, you might say, or just feeling itself as
            something bettween root-tip and leaf-tip, between deep earth and
            sky had suddenly waked up, and was considering you with the same
            slow care that it had given to its own inside affairs for endless
            years.'
