                of the Shire far away, no of the dark shadows and perils
                that encompassed them, but of the fair things they had seen
                in the world together, of the Elves, of the stars,

            Treebeard reveals himself to the hobbits, and they become acquainted, the hobbits sharing their story of Gandalf and the orcs of Isengard to Treebeard.
            Treebeard tells a bit about Ents to the hobbits as he carries them to an Entish home.
            The group arrives at an Enthouse
            Treebeard shows them around and shares some water, in preparation to begin his tales.

            Treebeard sings of the entwives
            They rest and wake to prepare for the "Entmoot", the gathering of the Ents.
            The entmoot begins, but the Hobbits become bored listening to the laborious entish language.

            The Ents finish their Moot, and begin their rally cries.

            Talk of the fight the Ents are preparing for.
            They begin their march to Isengard throught the forest.
        Quotes
            Often afterwards Pippen tried to describe his first impression of
            them. [Treebeards eyes]
            'One felt as if there was an enormous well behind them, filled up
            with ages of memory and long, slow, steady thinking; but their
            surface was sparkling with the the present; like sun shimmering on
            the outer leaves of a vast tree, or on the ripples of a very deep
            lake. I don't know, but it felt as if something that grew in the
            ground - asleep, you might say, or just feeling itself as
            something bettween root-tip and leaf-tip, between deep earth and
            sky had suddenly waked up, and was considering you with the same
            slow care that it had given to its own inside affairs for endless
            years.'
