        Quotes
            There they sat for some while, looking throught the window
                at the bright stars above the steep-climbing woods,
                and talking softly. They spoke no more of the mall news
                of the Shire far away, no of the dark shadows and perils
                that encompassed them, but of the fair things they had seen
                in the world together, of the Elves, of the stars,
                of trees, and the gentle fall of the bright year in the woods.

            And that is another reason why the Ring should be destroyed;
                as long as it is in the world it will be a danger
                even to the Wise.
                For nothing is evil in the beginning.
                Even Sauron was not so.

                silence fell. 'I am a servent of the Secret Fire,
                wielder of the flame of Anor. You cannot pass.
                The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun.
                Go back to the Shadow! You cannot pass.'
