Harry and Ron read the letter. Hermione says she will appeal, and Ron offers to
help. Hermione finally apoligizes about Scabbers.

Hagrid is defeated about Buckbeak. Malfoy is taunting them. Hermione slaps him.

Hermione misses the Charms class, which is uncharateristic. They find her later
all befuddled in the dorm. They go to divination. Trelawny teaches them about
Crystal Balls. As Trelawny begins to see the Grim in Harry's orb, Hermione gets
upset and actually leaves the class. Lavender and Parvati are impressed at the
prof ability to see, that earlier she predicted that "one of our number would
be leaving."

Harry is practicing like crazy for the match against Syltherin. They can only
win the cup if they win with fifty points up. The energy is high around this
match, and Harry feels the pressure.

The night before, Harry has dreams about the match. Harry thinks he sees
Crookshanks and the Grim outside the window. He wakes Ron, but by the time they
look out again, they are both gone.

The morning of, the energy is high. The match starts, and Lee Jordan
commentates again. Slytherin is cheating, and Gryffindor gets ahead on
penelties. It turns into a very dirty game, and Harry has to keep Malfoy off of
the trail of the Snitch.

Then Griffindor takes a fifty, then sixty point lead. Harry sees the snitch,
but Malfoy cheats and keeps Harry away from it. Malfoy then is about to get the
snitch, but Harry dives to him, knocks Malfoy's arm out of the way, and gets
the snitch. Gryffidnor goes wild, and they won the cup. Harry raises it in his
arms triumphantly. (This match was destribed in great detail, in excrutiatingly
longhand)
