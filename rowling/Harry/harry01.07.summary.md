# McGonagall meets the first years
## McGonagall informs the first years about a few things
The first years meet Professor McGonagall, who informs them about the four
houses, and the house cup.

## They encounter some ghosts
As they wait, Harry asks Ron how they are sorted, and he says some sort of
test. Ghosts go by and casually observe the first years.

# The first years get sorted
## The Sorting hat sorts the first years, and they each sit with their group
McGonagall takes them into the Great Hall where she introduces them to "the
sorting hat" who sings a song about sorting them. The students are called and
sorted. Harry is placed in Gryffindor with Ron and Neville and Hermione, along
with the other Weasley's.

# The feast
## Dumbledore says some words
Dumbledore stands and says a few random words, perhaps in jest.

## They meet the ghost of Gryffindor
The ghost of Gryffindor, Nearly Headless Nick, comes to introduce himself. He
says Slytherin, led by The Bloody Baron, has won the house cup the last six
years, and he wants to change that.

## Neville and Semus's background
We learn about the background of a Seamus (half muggle) and Neville, who was
presumed to be full muggle for a while.

## Harry's scar burns for a moment
Harry sees Snape across Quirrell at the high table and his scar burns. Snape
teaches potions and Quirrell teaches dark arts.

## Dumbledore concludes the festivities
Dumbledore gives some annoucements, telling the students not to go into the
forest, not to use magic in the hallways, and not to go to the third corridor
on the right hand side. They sing the "Hogwarts anthem" and get led off to
their respective halls.

# They go to their respective dorms
## Percy leads them through Hogwarts
Percy leads them, they run across Peeves, a Poltergiest that only respects the
Bloody Baron, and they get to a portrait (all the portraits are animate) of a
fat woman who asks the password. Percy give the password "Caput Draconis" and
leads the first years into their respective girl and boy dorms.

## Harry has a dream
Harry has a dream about Quirrell's turban, Slytherin, Malfoy, and Snape, and he
sees a green flash and his scar burns. He goes back to sleep and forgets it.
