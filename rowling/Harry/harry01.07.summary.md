The first years meet Professor McGonagall, who informs them about the four
houses, and the house cup.

As they wait, Harry asks Ron how they are sorted, and he says some sort of
test. Ghosts go by and casually observe the first years.

McGonagall takes them into the Great Hall where she introduces them to "the
sorting hat" who sings a song about sorting them. The students are called and
sorted. Harry is placed in Gryffindor with Ron and Neville and Hermione, along
with the other Weasley's.

Dumbledore stands and says a few random words, perhaps in jest.

The ghost of Gryffindor, Nearly Headless Nick, comes to introduce himself. He
says Slytherin, led by The Bloody Baron, has won the house cup the last six
years, and he wants to change that.

We learn about the background of Neville, who was presumed to be full muggle
for a while.

Harry sees Snape across Quirrell at the high table and his scar burns. Snape
teaches potions and Quirrell teaches dark arts.

Dumbledore gives some annoucements, telling the students not to go into the
forest, not to use magic in the hallways, and not to go to the third corridor
on the right hand side. They sing the "Hogwarts anthem" and get led off to
their respective halls.

Percy leads them, they run across Peeves, a Poltergiest that only respects the
Bloody Baron, and they get to a portrait (all the portraits are animate) of a
fat woman who asks the password. Percy give the password "Caput Draconis" and
leads the first years into their respective girl and boy dorms.

Harry has a dream about Quirrell's turban, Slytherin, Malfoy, and Snape, and he
sees a green flash and his scar burns. He goes back to sleep and forgets it.
