The day to leave comes, and they all pack into Mr. Weasley's modified car.

They get to Platform nine and three quarters. The rest go in, but Harry and Ron
thump into the wall. Ron gets the idea to use the car. His parents can
"Apperate", disappear and appear at home, so they take the car.

They go invisible and follow the train. They have a grand old time flying over
the train. They see Hogwarts, but the car starts to lose energy. They crash
land into a tree, and Ron breaks his wand. The tree starts to attack them, but
the car comes back to life in time for them to get away.

They make it to Hogwarts, but they are late to the great feast. The sorting is
happening. As they walk in, they see everyone but Snape. They start to
conjecture what happened to him, and Snape appears behind them.

Turns out, Muggles saw the flying car and it's all over the muggle news. Snape
can't expell them, but goes to get McGonagall who can. Dumbledore eventually
comes in and Harry shrinks before him as he explains himself. They don't get
expelled but get a stern warning.

The professors go back to the Great Feast, and Ron and Harry go to the
Gryffindor dorms, where they meet with Hermione.

In the dorms, Lee Jordan, the twins, and Percy, all have their own reactions to
what's happened. Most are just in awe that they came to Hogwarts in a flying
car.

In the second year room, Neville, Seamus, and Dean Thomas remark on how cool
the flying car is.
