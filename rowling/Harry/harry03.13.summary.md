a blast on his firebolt in the final practice before the Ravenclaw match, which

When Ron gets his turn to ride the Firebolt, they see Crookshanks in the
corner.

People from the schools admire the Firebolt, including Penelope, Percy's
girlfriend. Malfoy and Harry have some trash talk.

Harry notices how attractive Cho Chang is when the start the match. Lee Jordan
commentates the match. Harry and Cho chase eachother aronud missing the snitch
a couple times. The last time, Harry sees three dementors, and calmly summons
his Patronus to ward them off. He catches the snitch and wins the match for
Gryffindor.

In the celebration, Lupin reveals that the dementors were really Malfoy Crabbe
and Goyle in robes. They get detention for their bafoonery.

In the after party, everyone but Hermione is celebrating. Harry goes to talk to
her. Ron tells her off, and she goes upset into the girls dorm.

That night, Harry has a dream of chasing his Patronus, before he wakes up to a
bunch of commotion. The students think that Black has come in.

McGonagall thinks it's all nonsense, but they realize that Black must have
gotten the passwords from Neville Longbottom, who wrote them all down to
remember them and probably left them outside somewhere.
