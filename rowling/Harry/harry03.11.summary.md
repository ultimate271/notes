Back at Hogwarts, Harry goes through the album Hagrid gave him and spots Black
in his parents wedding photo. Ron comes in but Harry pretends to be asleep,
contemplating how Black might have betrayed his parents.

On the first day of the holidays, Ron and Hermione talk with Harry about the
whole thing. Harry is super pissed and is contemplating going after Black.

They go to Hagrid. Hagrid answers the door in tears. Lucious Malfoy has ordered
the Commitee for Disposal of Dangerous Creatures to investigate and elimnate
Buckbeak. The trio comforts Hagrid. Hagrid reflects on his time at Azkaban in
the last book.

The trio goes to the Library to research on Hippogryphs.

When the open presents, Harry gets a Firebolt. They speculate on who bought it.
Hermione suggests them not try it. Her cat, Crookshanks, attacks Scabbers, and
the Sneakoscope goes crazy.

At the Great Hall, the professors are eating, and invite the kids to eat with
them.

Prof Trelawny, the divination prof, comes in with a prophecy. She asks where
Lupin is, and he is sick again.

When Harry and Ron get up, Trelawny asks which of them got up first. They don't
know. Hermione asks for some time alone with McGonagall, and Harry and Ron go
back to the dorms.

Hermione comes with McGonagall, who takes the broom from Harry. They suspect it
was sent by Black.
