We are reintroduced to Harry. He is havinga miserable time at the Dursley's.

Mr. Dursley annoncues his big day. Harry thinks for a second it might be
because it is his birthday, but instead, Mr. Dursley is sealing a deal with his
drilling company. The family goes through the role in inviting the Mason's to
dinner. Harry's role is "I will stay in his room pretending he's not there."

They talk about getting a vacation home in Majorca.

Harry hasn't gotten a letter all summer from anyone. Harry thinks about his
encounter with Voldemort as he stares at the hedge. He sees eyes staring back
at him.

Dudley taunts Harry, saying he has no friends at that freak plays, and Harry
pretends to use magic, but pays for it with punishment.

He scarfs down his food just before the Mason's come over. As he goes to his
bed, he sees some one in it.
