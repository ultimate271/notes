Harry is happy when the weekend comes, due to a rather hectic first week back.
He is thinking about the plans to visit Hagrid, when Oliver Wood wakes him up
at the crack of dawn for Quidditch practice.

Colin inturrupts Harry on the way to pratice, showing him the photo. Harry
explains the rules of Quidditch to him before shooing him off.

Wood drones on about new plans, and people fall asleep listening. The team is
Alicia Spinnet, Katie Bell, and Angelina Johnson as chasers, Weasley twins as
beaters, Oliver as Keeper, and Harry as Seeker. They get to practice, and Ron
and Hermione are there watching, and Colin is taking picture of Harry.

The Slytherin team led by Marcus Flint comes in with a letter from Snape,
giving the access to the field to train their new seeker, Draco Malfoy, with
the new Nimbus 2001 broom sticks that they all have.

Malfoy taunts Hermione and Ron, and Ron points his wand at him, but it
malfunctions and throws him back.

Harry and Hermione take Ron to Hagrid's but they see Lockhart instead. They
hide while Lockhart leaves.

Hagrid gives his candid opinion about Lockhart. Then they say that Malfoy
called Hermione a Mudblood, which is what caused Ron to stir.

Hagrid teases Harry about the photo. They then see that Hagrid is growing a
bunch of Pumpkins, and enlarging them with spells, even though he is not
allowed to do magic.

McGonagall inform Harry and Ron about their detention. Ron is to polish the
trophies, and Harry is to help Lockhart with his fan mail.

As he is signing address on evelopes, Harry drones out Lockhart's voice, and as
he is signing a envelope to Veronica Smethley, he hears a voice tell him to
"Come to me, Let me rip you, Let me tear you, Let me kill you." He tells Ron
about it after their detention is done.
