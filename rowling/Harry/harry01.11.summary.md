Quidditch season is approaching.

Hermione has become friends with the group. Snape limps over to them, and
deducts points from Gryffindor for Harry having Quidditch Through the Ages. He
takes it from them.

When he goes to Snape to get the book back, he sees him talking to Filch about
his leg, and alludes to the Cerberus. The group contemplates its meaning.

The first Quidditch match of the year, Gryffindor v Slytherin begins. Harry is
nervous. Madame Hooch is referee, Lee Jordan, friend of the Weasley's is
commentating. Harry looks for the snitch and eventually finds it. He gets
fouled though, to the disgust of the Gryffindor observers. Harry's broom starts
to go on the fritz.

Hermione takes Hagrids binoculars and sees Snape muttering a curse on Harry's
broom. Hermione goes behind Snape, accidentally knocking Quirrell first, and
sets his robes on fire. Harry gets control of his broom. Harry almost swallows
the snitch, but grabs it and wins the game for Gryffindor.

Later, in Hagrid's hut, as they discuss things, Hagrid reveals the Cerberus
name is Fluffy, and implicate Snape in trying to steal the thing it guards.
Hagrid then reveals a Nicolas Flamel is involved, but catches himself before
revealing more.
