Mr. and Mrs. Weasley are glad to see their daughter alive.

Harry goes over what happened in the year. When he gets to the diary part,
though, he hesitates. Dumbledore talks about Riddle's transformation from
Riddle to Voldemort. Ginny then bursts out her part in the whole thing.

Ginny and her parents go out. Dumbledore takes back his words, and instead of
pnuishing Harry and Ron for breaking the rules, he awards them 200 points each.

Ron leaves, and Harry and Dumbledore have some one on one time. Dumbledore
thanks Harry for the loyalty. That's why Fawkes was able to get there.

Harry then goes on about how he thinks he isn't like Riddle despite what he
said. Dumbledore then says the sorting hat put him in Gryffindor because he
asked, and it was his choice that defines him. The sword from the hat has
Godric Gryffindor engraved on it.

Lucius comes in with Dobby. Dumbledore is back, because the eleven other
governors overwhelmingly voted him back. Turns out Lucius did threaten them.

Dumbledore then reveals to Lucious about the diary. Dobby keeps trying to
signal to Harry about the Diary. That it was Lucious's. Harry gets it, and
tells off Malfoy for giving it to Ginny in Flourish and Blotts.

Malfoy leaves. As he does, Harry asks for the diary to give to Malfoy. He puts
it in a sock, and gives it to malfoy. He discards the sock, and Dobby picks it
up. This frees him from his owner.

When Harry asks Dobby about the fact that it wasn't about Voldemort, Dobby says
that it wasn't, it was about him before he changed his name.

They all have a grand time at the feast.

Aftermath. Lucious is sacked as governor, no more Defense of Dark Arts teacher.

On the way out, its ron, the twins, harry, hermione, and Ginny. They ask Ginny
what Percy's secret was. She reveals that she caught him kissing Penelope
Clearwater, the Ravenclaw Prefect.

Harry gives Ron and Hermione his telephone number, and tells them how to use
it. Hermione says that the Dursley's should be proud, but Harry says they'll
just be upset that he didn't die in spite of all the chances he got. They go
back to the muggle world.
