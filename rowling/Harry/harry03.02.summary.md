The next morning, on the TV, we here about a Black that is armed and dangerous.

Vernon pulls away from the TV to announce he is going to pick up Marge. Harry
doesn't like Marge, and recalls past encounters with her. Vernon lays ground
rules to Harry. Harry is able to strike a deal with Vernon that if he behaves
himself with Aunt Marge, he'll sign his form.

Harry tidies up in pretending to be a muggle.

Aunt Marge arrives, and they share greetings.

Marge turns to Harry and talks very demeaningly to him. She promotes her stance
on whipping.

As they are drinking wine, Marge insults Harry's parents, and as she does, the
wine glass she is holding breaks.

The next morning, when Marge continues to go on about Harry's parents, Harry
snaps, defends his parents, and Marge begins to inflate. Harry grabs his wand,
and threatens Vernon, and gets out of the house.
