A bunch of people try to cheer Harry up in the hospital, but Harry doesn't tell
them about the Grim. He keeps the pieces of his broomstick even though he knows
it's not going to be able to be put back together.

Lupin is back in the Dark Arts class. Lupin lets them off of the Werewolf
paper.

Harry and Lupin talk about the Dementors. Lupin says that Azkaban is guarded by
Dementors, because they suck all the will to escape out of the prisonors. Lupin
then promises to teach Harry about how to defeat them.

Things take an upturn as Christmas approaches. Harry is left behind on another
Hogsmeade trip. Fred and George surprise Harry with an early birthday gift, The
Maurader's Map of Hogwarts, that they stole from Filch. It shows secret
passages into Hogsmeade.

Harry makes his way to the secret passage and gets through. Harry comes up
through a trapdoor into Honeydukes.

He meets Ron and Hermione and tells them about the map. Hermione is not happy
about it, but Harry justifies himself again.

They visit places around Hogsmeade. In "The Three Broomsticks" McGonagall,
Hagrid, Flitwick, and Fudge, enter. Harry hides under the table.

They talk about the Dementors, how they are such an inconvienence. Fudge talks
about how Black and James Potter were such good friends. Black is Harry's
Godfather. When the Potter's went into hiding, they used a spell called the
Fidelius Charm to hide their location, with Sirius as the Secret Keeper of the
spell. Black betrayed them to Voldemort only a week after the spell had been
cast.

Hagrid talks about his encounter with Black when he went to fetch Harry. Black
asked for Harry, but Hagrid had strict orders from Dumbledore.

Peter Pettigrew then was the one that found Black. Black then killed Pettigrew,
and Fudge found him in that crater laughing.

They speculate the reasons for Black's escape.

They leave the Three Broomsticks.
