October arrived, and it's raining and stuff. Harry practices Qudditch in the
rain. Harry meets Nearly Headless Nick who is frustrated that he was not
admitted into the headless club.

Mrs. Norris views Harry, and Nick advises him to leave quickly, since Filch
just cleaned and is not in the best of moods. Filch appears and takes Harry
away for punishment. As he is being served, Peeves makes a noise and Filch
hurries out.

In the boredom of sitting there, he sees a note about a Kwikspell course. Like
an infomercial. Filch comes back, and suspects Harry read the letter, but Harry
claims he didn't. Filch lets him off.

Turns out, Nick suggested Peeves make a distraction to get Harry out of
detention. Grateful for Nick, he agrees to visit his Deathday party. He tells
Ron and Hermione about it, but not about the Kwikspell course.

At the Deathday party, there are a bunch of ghosts, and Hermione takes care to
avoid Moaning Myrtle, one of the ghosts that haunts a women room toilet.

There is food there, and the ghosts "eat" by just being on it. Peeves,
overhearing Hermione talk about Myrtle, calls her over. Myrtle crys on hearing
Hermione try and salvage her words.

Nick then is about to get up and have a speech when a dozen headless horsmen
come in and taunt him. The trio leaves as Nick fails to capture the audience.

On the way to the great hall, Harry hears more voices. Harry runs to the second
floor, following the voice, and they see a sign that says the Chamber of
Secrets has been opened. They see Mrs Norris hanging by the tail under it. They
try and get out of there, but the feast had just finished. Malfoy comes to the
front, someone shouts "Enemies of the heir, beware (which was on the sign),
you'll be next mudbloods!" and Malfoy grins at the sight of the hanging cat.
