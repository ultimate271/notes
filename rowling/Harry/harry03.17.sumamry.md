The trio is shocked, but they keep going. Scabbers is still going nuts.

They run across Crookshanks, and Scabbers gets out. Ron gets out of the cloak
to go after him. Harry and Hermione go to try and save ron. Then they run
across the dog. The dog attacks Harry, and Ron trys to save Harry. In the
confusion, they come to the willow, who get's involved in the fray. Crookshanks
gets out, slithers like a snake to a knot in the tree and presses it, which
stops the tree.

They end up in a tunnel beneath the roots of the tree, chasing after the
animals. Harry and Hermione follow. The dog had taken Ron down this tunnel.
This tunnel leads to the Shriking Shack. In a bedroom, they see Crookshanks on
teh bed, and Ron on the ground. This has been a trap. Black appears behind them
and Expelliarums'es to disarm Harry and Hermione.

Black taunts Harry, he says there is only going to be one murder tonight. Harry
gets upset at Black. There is a whole scuffle, with people attacking people and
tackling and stuff. Harry gets his wand and points it at Black, who urges Harry
to listen to the whole story. Crookshanks gets in the way of the wand.

Harry hesititates at killing Black, and Hermione shouts at Lupin, who is coming
with them, that they are there.

Lupin comes up and disarms Harry. Lupin and Sirius embrace. Hermione reveals
that Lupin is a werewolf. The whole thing is quite befuddling to Harry.

Lupin says he found them on the map. He gives them back their wands so that
they will listen. Lupin asks for Scabbers. Lupin reveals that Scabbers is an
Animagus of Peter Pettigrew.
