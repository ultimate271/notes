# Journey with Hagrid
## Harry wakes
Harry wakes thinking the whole thing must have been a dream.

He realizes it was not. An owl comes in with a newspaper, and Hagrid informs
Harry to pay it with some Knuts.

## Dialogue with Hagrid as they go to London

that his parents left their inheritance in Gringot's bank run by Goblins.

Hagrid talks about the Ministry of Magic, led by Cornelius Fudge.

Harry examines the second page of the letter detailing his school supplies
needed.

## Leaky Cauldren
The duo make it to the Leaky Cauldren in London, where people begin to rever
Harry. They meet Professor Quirrell, the professor of the Defense against the
Dark Arts. He met vampires in the Black Forest and was never the same since.

Hagrid taps on a particular brick, and the wall opens to Diagon Alley.

They make it to Gringot's. They go through a series of a maze to get to Harry's
inheritance. They then go to vault 713 to get the package Dumbeldore sent for
them.

After this, they go to Madam Malkin's Robes, Hagrid goes back to the Cauldren
to get Ice Cream, and he has an unpleasent convesation with a boy in the robe
shop. Lot's of preliminary background info here.

cauldren and all sorts of things.

## The owl
Hagrid buy's Harry and owl for his birthday.

combinations, they eventually find that a wand with the feather of the same
wand that Voldemort got was the wand that chose Harry.
