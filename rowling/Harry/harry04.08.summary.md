They walk up to the huge stadium and get to their seats. In their box, Harry
sees a house elf. After mistaking it for Dobby, it turns out to be Winky. They
talk about how freedom isn't treating Dobby very well. Winky says she is saving
her seat for her master. Ron comments on the house elf.

Many important wizards come by, including Fudge. Percy embarrasesses himself
trying to be cordial to Fudge. The Malfoy's appear, and greet the Minister of
Magic Fudge. His wife's name is Narcissa. Fudge introduces Lucious to Oblansk,
the Bulgarian Minister of Magic. Lucious then comments on Arthur being in such
a respected seat.

Bagman comes in and introduces the World Cup. The Bulgarian mascots, Veela,
come in, which are radiant womanly figures. They are very seductive, and bring
Harry to almost jump from his seat to please them. The Irish then make their
mascot display, with a shamrock of Leprecauns and raining gold.

They introduce the players, starting with the bulgarians, ending with Viktor
Krum. Then the Irish, with Lynch last. Hassan Mostafa is the referee.

Harry begins watching through the omnoculars in awe. We get play by play's
score reports, commentary. Krum pulls a maneuver to trick Lynch, and Lynch
falls to the ground for a timeout.

Ireland is up 130 to 10. There is a whole debacle with the mascots, and the ref
actually gets lured in by the Veela. The game gets nasty. After another foul,
the Veela actually become fierce to the taunting Lepracauns. The game almost
becomes overshadowed because of it. Krum gets hurt.

Then Lynch goes into a dive, and they are sure that this one isn't a feint.
Krum follows all bloody and everything. Lynch crashes again, and Krum gets the
snitch, but Bulgaria still loses 170-160.

The attention then goes to the Top Box, where the losing team makes laps, then
the winning team makes laps. This is a quidditch match to remember.
