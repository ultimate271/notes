The buzz from Gryffindor winning the quiditch cup lasts a while. It's June, and
finals are coming up.

Hermione has overlapping exams, and Ron and Harry question her again about it.

Hedwig comes in with a note from Hagrid about the appeal. They are bringing the
executioner to the appeal, meaning they've essentially already decided.

They go through their exams. At the end of their Dark Arts exam, the trio runs
into Fudge, who talks about overseeing the exection of Buckbeak. Behind him
come two wizards, one with an axe.

In the last exam, Divination, they take turns meeting the prof with a crystal
ball. Ron goes, and doesn't see anything in the ball. Harry sees the Hippogryph
in the ball. Then, as he is about to leave, a voice very unlike Trelawny's
comes from her, saying in ominous tone that the servent of the dark lord will
return tonight. Trelawny snaps out of it and doesn't remember anything about
the episode.

They get a letter from Hagrid, the appeal was lost and teh execution is to
happen at sundown. Hermione fetches the inivsibility cloak from it's hiding
place.

They make it to Hagrids under the cloak. Hagrid is defeated. Hermione finds
Scabbers in the milk jug as she pours some milk.

The executioners come, and the trio escapes the back way out of Hagrids, under
the cloak. Scabbers is going nuts, and they hear the execution of Buckbeak
behind them.
