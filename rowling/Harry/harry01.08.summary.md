# Background about Hogwarts
People stare at Harry even the very next morning.

Hogwarts is a confusing maze of a place. Harry and Ron had not made good
acquaintence with the caretaker, Argus Filch, and his cat Mrs. Norris.

# Classes
Classes were difficult, and we get a bit of an overview of the classes Harry is
taking. Herbology with Prof Sprout, History of Magic with Ghost Binns, Charms
with Flitwick, Transfiguration with McGonagall, and Defense against the Dark
Arts with Quirrell.

On Friday, the end of the first week, Harry gets a note from Hagrid to have
tea.

Before that, he goes to potions class with Snape. Snape clearly dislikes Harry,
and singles him out, and deducts points from Gryffindor when Harry doesn't know
the answers. Neville clumsily misconcocts a potion and develops boils on his
nose, and Seamus takes him to the medical ward.

# Harry and Ron visit Hagrid
Harry and Ron go to Hagrid's where they tell him about their first day of
classes. Hagrid changes the subject when Harry says that Snape might not like
him. On the table, Harry sees an article about the breakin at Gringotts, and
sees that it happened on the same day that he and Hagrid were there, and that
the vault that they were trying to steal from was emptied just that day as
well. Hagrid very much dodged the issue this time.
