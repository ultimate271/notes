As they make their way to the tunnel, Black offers Harry to stay with him, once
he's free.

They make it out of the tunnel at the Weeping Willow.

The clouds move, and the full moon turns Lupin into a werewolf. In the
confusion, Pettigrew gets Lupin's dropped wand, Harry knocks it out, and in the
confusion, Pettigrew turns into the rat and scurries away.

Black turned into a dog to fight Lupin the Werewolf. They are gone, and the
trio is left with snape. Then they hear Sirius the dog in pain.

The dementors are all crowding Sirius. Harry tries to summon his Patronus with
Hermiones help, but they fail. One of the Dementors starts to perform the kiss
on Harry.

Then, in the distance, he sees the brightness of a patronus scare the dementors
away, before he loses consciousness.
