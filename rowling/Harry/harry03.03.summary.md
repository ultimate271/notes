Harry goes to Magnolia Crescent, and contemplates the severity of his
situation.

He gets the idea to go to London, get his Gringotts, and live as an outcast.

In the alley, he hears something. When he figures out what it is, he realizes
sees a triple decker bus called The Knight Bus.

The conductor, Stan Shunpike, introduces himself, and invites Harry on board.
Harry thought he saw a massive dog, but it's gone now.

Harry introduces himself as Neville Longbottom, the first name in his head. In
the back of the bus there is an Ernie Prang. They head off.

Stan gives the wheel to Ernie to go wake Madam Marsh. Marsh exits, and they
resume.

Stan reads an article about Sirius Black. He escaped Azkaban, and Fudge
Ministre of Magic had to alert the Muggle Prime Minister. Black killed 13
people in one curse thirteen years ago. He was second in command to Voldemort,
and when Voldemort was gone, he killed 13 people just to escape arrest.

Harry thinks about his fate, potential in Azkaban.

Harry is the last passenger, and asks to be taken to Diagon Alley. When he
arrives, Fudge is there to meet him. After some confusion by Stan abou the
identity of Neville/Harry, Harry is led by Fudge into a private stall.

Fudge informs Harry that Marge has been deflated and forgetful magic has been
used. Fudge then suggests he get a room in the Cauldren. When Harry asks about
his punishment, Fudge says that "circumstances have change" from last year, and
shrugs it off.

Fudge concludes the conversation. Harry asks if he could perhaps have Fudge
sign the document to let him into Hogsmeade, but Fudge declines. Tom, the
barkeep, takes him to his room number 11. Hedwig is there, and Harry falls to
sleep.
