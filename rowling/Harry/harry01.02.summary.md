## The start of Dudley's birthday
Harry is rudely woken up by his Aunt and Uncle, who have taken him in, on
Dudley's birthday. Harry was having a dream about flying motorcycles, but
forgot it.

Dudley begins counting his presents, and gets upset that there are not more
than last years. His parents enable his behavior.

## Trying to figure out what to do with Harry on the trip to the zoo
When trying to figure out what to do with Harry when they take Dudley out for
his birthday, the Dursley's run out of time and decide to just take him with on
the trip to the zoo.

## Aside about strange things that have happened around Harry in the past
Here, we learn about strange things that happened to Harry. One time Mrs.

a sweater on, but it kept shrinking.

## The glass vanishes of a boa exhibit vanishes
On the way to the zoo, Mr. Dursley talks about motorcycles, and Harry remembers
his dream.

When the get to the zoo, they come to an exhibit with a boa constrictor. Harry
begins talking with it, and the snake motions mysteriously to Harry. Suddenly,
the glass simply disappears, and the constrictor scares Dudley. This whole
incident is blamed on Harry.

## Harry gets thrown into the cupboard and contemplates his existance
When they get back, Mr. Dursley locks Harry in the cupboard for him to stay
there as punishment.

In the cupboard, Harry thinks about being taken away, but has no family besides
the Dursley's. He thinks back to weird cloaked people waving at him, but they
always disappear before he can see them clearly
