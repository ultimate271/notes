Harry and Ron are mad at Hermione, and she avoids them.

Wood comes back, and Ron blurts out about the firebolt. Wood promises to talk
to Mcgonagall about it.

Harry reminds Lupin about his anti-dementor lessons. The so called Patronus
Charm works only when the user is thinking of a fond memory. They practice on
the Boggart, and Harry thinks about the first time he got on a broom. Harry
fails the first time. The second he thinks about Gryffindor winning the house
cup. He fails again. This time he hears his father from the Dementor/Boggart.
This last time he remembers when Hagrid told him he's a wizard. Lupin knew
Black and James, but shrugs off Harry's mention of them.

Ron comments on Hermione's impossible schedule. Wood was unable to convince
McGonagall about the Firebolt.

A few weeks later, Harry is barely able to get a Partronus Cloud. Lupin tells
Harry about the Dementors Kiss which sucks the soul out of someone. It's
Black's sentence.

McGonagall gives Harry his Firebolt. In the common room, Harry and Ron attempt
to make ammends with Hermione. Ron offers to put the Firebolt up in the dorm
while Harry talks to Hermione. During their conversation, Ron finds Scabbers
missing with cat hairs on the floor.
