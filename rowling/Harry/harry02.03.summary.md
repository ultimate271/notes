Ron, with his twin brothers, are in a flying car outside the window. Harry says
there's been a mix up (Ron's dad works for the Ministry of Magic), but Ron
insists that he get in. Harry says that all of his stuff is locked in the
cupboard, so the twins use their shenanigans to pick locks and such and get all
of the stuff.

Vernon wakes up, and Harry grabs Hedwig. He is the rope of tug of war before
the Weasleys win and bring him away.

They let Hedwig out of the cage. Harry tells them about Dobby. When they start
thinking about it, they think it could be Malfoy. George talks about Lucius
Malfoy, Draco's father, and how he was a supporter of Voldemort.

Ron was getting worried that his owl Errol had failed. He wanted to use Percy's
owl Hermes, but Percy was uncannily busy this year.

They talk about their dad, he works with the Ministry on The Misuse of Muggle
Artifacts Office. Anecdote about a teapot.

They arrive at the Weasley house, called the Burrow. They come up with a plan
to make it seem like they didn't steal the car, but Mrs. Weasley is on top of
them. She gets upset until she sees Harry.

Harry marvels at the wizard house. THey eat breakfast. Ginny sneaks in, and
they remark that she has been admiring Harry.

For punishment, Ron has to de-gnome the garden. Mrs. Weasley marvels a bit at
the book by Gilderoy Lockheart on household pests. They degnome the garden,
gnomes being not to bright creatures.

Mr. Weasley goes on about his day. Mrs. Weasley scolds him for not telling her
about the flying car. After Mr. Weasley learns Harry was there, and lightly
scolds his boys for using the car, Ron takes Harry to his room. Ginny is being
all creeper around him. Harry compliments the house.
