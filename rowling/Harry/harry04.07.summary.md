They come to the place, and Arthur gets instructions from the wizards there
where to go.

They get to a campsite, and Arthur has an amusing conversation with the guy
there about all the strange folk that have been showing up lately. A wizard
comes in and memory charms the guy, and mentions that Ludo Bagman has been
talking about Quidditch in a loud voice, making his job difficult.

They pitch the tent, and come inside to behold that it's bigger on teh inside
than out. The trio tours the campground, and makes note of all the different
wizards there.

They run into Seamus and Dean, and talk about the cup. They also run across
Oliver Wood, Ernie Macmillan, and Cho Chang. They then run across some students
from another school.

They get back to the tent, and many people greet Mr. Weasley at their site.
Bagman comes by to say hello. Against Arthur's wishes, the Weasley twins begin
betting on the game.

Bagman sits down because he is waiting for Barty Crouch. They ask about Bertha
Jorkins, who is still missing. Barty Crouch shows up, a very orderly man, and
tells Bagman taht the Hungarians whan more seats.

Ludo then let's loose about something else to announce, but Crouch stiffles
him. They both Apperate away.

At dusk, a bunch of wizards perform magic, and start selling souviniers. Ron
buys a shamrock hat and a minature of Viktor Krum. Harry buys three pairs of
Omnioculars.

A gong sounds, signalling the beginning of the cup.
