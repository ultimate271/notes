Hermoine is intent on study for finals, even though they are still 10 weeks
away. Hagrid comes in to the library with something behind his back. The gang
questions him about the sorcerers stone but he quickly hushes them. When they
investigate they see he was looking up books about dragons.

They talk to Hagrid, and Hermione sweet talks him into revealing that many
professors put obstactles in the way of the sorcerers stone. They then look at
his dragon egg which he has in the fire.

Later, Harry gets a note from Hagrid saying "It's hatching." Malfoy overhears
them talk about it.

When the group goes to watch it hatch, they catch Malfoy eavesdropping on them.

A week later, they try and convince Hagrid to get rid of teh dragon, that he
has named Norbert. Harry gets the idea to send it to Ron's older brother,
Charlie, in Romania.

They get a reply from Charlie saying he will take it, but that they have to
bring it to the top of the highest tower.

Ron got his hand bit, and in get it investigated, they realize that Malfoy
borrowed a book that had the letter of Charlie's so he knows. They decide to go
through with the plan anyway.

They get the dragon. On the way up to the tower, they see Malfoy getting
scolded by McGonagall for trying to snitch on them. They get to the top and
Charlie takes the dragon away. On teh way back down, they get caught by Filch,
because they forgot the invisibility cloak on the way back.
