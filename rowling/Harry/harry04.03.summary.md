Harry goes into the kitchen, where Dudley, having received a bad report from
boarding school, is placed on a diet. They all go on the diet.

But Harry got food from his friends, when he owled them about the situation.

One day, Mr. Dursley gets a letter from Mrs. Weasley about the Quidditch World
Cup. They go on and on about the letter, with Mr. Dursley picking it apart.
When Mr. Dursley is being defiant, Harry brings up Sirius. At this, Vernon
relents.

Back in his room, he gets a note from Ron. Harry sends the affirmative reply.
Then he finally mails his letter to Sirius.
