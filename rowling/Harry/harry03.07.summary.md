In potions class, Malfoy is milking his arm injury. Snape asks Ron and Harry to
embarrasingly do things for Malfoy. Malfoy talks about his fathers influence.

Neville is doing horribly, and Hermione offers to help but Snape refuses to let
her.

Seamus mentions that Black was sighted by a muggle not far from Hogwarts.
Malfoy taunts Harry, saying he should go after him himself.

Snape tests Neville's potion on his toad, and when it works, assumes Hermione
has been helping, and deducts points from Gryffindor.

As they walk out, Hermione does some weird dissappearing and reappearing.

In Lupin's Defense against the Dark Arts, he takes the class out of the
classroom. There is some humorous banter between Peeves and Lupin. He takes
them into the staffroom, where Snape is sitting. Snape leaves, and warns Lupin
of Neville.

Inside a wardrobe, there is a Boggart. Boggarts take the form of the thing that
scares the person that sees it the most. You beat it by confronting it as a
group, the Boggart get's confused to what to turn in to, and you can beat it
with laughter.

Lupin asks Neville to think about his biggest fear, being Snape, and then
imagine that Snape is dressed in his Grandmothers clothes.

Harry thinks of a dementor, but before he is able think about how to make it
comical, the Boggart is released. Snape comes out, and Neville uses the
Riddikulus spell to dress him. Then Parvati goes, the boggart turns into a
mummy that trips over it's own bandages.

The whole class goes through this ritual, with the Boggart constantly
transforming. Ron sees a spider, and Lupin sees a silvery-white orb. Neville is
last, and finishes it off.

Lupin gives points to everyone that faced the Boggart, and to Harry and
Hermione for answering questions about it. Harry wonders why Lupin stopped
Harry from encountering the Boggart.
