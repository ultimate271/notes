Things seem wrong to Harry.

Malfoy goes around bragging about how his dad suspended Dumbledore. Malfoy
suggests Snape apply to be headmaster. Ron gets upset at Malfoy for wishing
Hermione would have died.

Ernie and his friend Hannah make up to Harry, and fill the missing spots of
Justin and Hermione in Herbology. They see some spiders, and reckon that they
are going into the forbidden forest. Ron and Harry plan to follow them later.

Lockhart makes comments about how they are safe now.

They get Fang, and go into the forest. Harry lights the way. They see a trail
of spiders going into the trees, and they follow it.

Eventually, they see on their right, the enchanted car. It had made it's way
into the forest.

They go further in, and they get taken away by massive spiders in a clearing of
the woods. The spiders bring forth Aragog, a massive spider. When he realizes
that they don't have Hagrid. Aragog says to kill them. Harry blurts taht they
are friends of Hagrid.

Aragog tells his story, how Hagrid took him and protected him, and the respect
that he has for Hagrid. He then talks about the monster in the chamber, and
refuses to speak about it.

When Harry tries to go, the Aragog says that he cannot deny his children so
fresh a meat.

As they are about to be devoured, the car comes to them and saves them. They
get Fang and the car leads them out of the forest.

They learn that Hagrid hadn't opened the Chamber, but had hatched Aragog in a
Hogwarts basement.

When they get back to the dorm, Harry has the revalation that the girl that had
died could be Moaning Myrtle. She could know about the Chamber of Secrets.
