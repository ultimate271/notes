The next day, the group recoils from their experience with the dog. Neville is
scared, and Hermione isn't speaking to them.

Harry receives a Nimbus 2000 from McGonagall, in secret. Malfoy blocks Harry on
the way to open it, but get's embarressed when Prof Flitwick mentions that
McGonagall gave it to Harry.

Harry meet's Oliver Wood in the Quiditch field to practice with the new broom.
Wood teaches Harry the rules of Quidditch.

Two months go by. One day in Charms, they learn how to make something levitate,
and Hermione shows up Ron, who then rebuffs her. It's rumored that Hermione was
crying in the girls room, perhaps because of Ron's comments.

During the Halloween feast, Quirrell comes in and reveals that a troll is
loose. Dumbledore tells the prefects to round up the students, but Harry and
Ron break off to find Hermione, who knows nothing about the troll.

As they sneak, the see Snape going towards the third floor.

As they follow Snape, they hear the troll. They lock it from following them,
but then later, they hear a scream from the girls bathroom. After going back
and saving Hermione in a rather humourous mismatch of distraction and antics,
the three of them get caught by McGonagall, Snape, Quirrell.  Hermione lies
about what happened to get Harry and Ron out of trouble. Hermione is deducted 5
points and Harry and Ron are given 5 points to Gryffindor.

Hermione becomes friends with the two thereafter.
