The next day at breakfast, during the ceremonies, Ron gets a "howler" from his
mother, scolding him for his actions. The whole school hears it.

Their first class is Herbology, and Professor Sprout is with Lockheart, helping
repair the Willow Tree. Lockheart takes Harry away and apologizes for giving
him the taste of fame. He presumes that Harry pulled the stunt out of thirst
for being in the paper. Harry goes back to Herbology.

The talk about Mandrake aka Mandragora, which are powerful restoritive plants.
But their crys will kill any who hear it. The trio joins up with a fourth,
Justin Finch-Fletchley from Hufflepuff. Justin admires Lockhart for a bit.

In transfiguration, Ron has trouble with his broken wand.

In the afternoon, they have class with Lockhart in Dark Arts, and see Hermione
has put his name in hearts on her schedule.

During their downtime, a Colin Creevey, a first year of Gryffindor, wants to
have his picture with Harry. Malfoy overhears, and taunts Harry and Ron.
Lockhart comes to swoop in and "save" the situation by taking the picture with
Harry, then gives him some life advice, saying that he's not quite famous
enough to be doing signed photos yet.

Their first quiz is all about Lockhart, and the things he likes and wants to
do. Hermione gets all of the questions right.

He then takes out some pixies. When neville remarks how harmless they are, he
lets them out. They wreck havoc, but he is unable to tame them, and assigns the
trio to take care of them. Hermione happily defends Lockhart, but Harry and Ron
aren't so convinced of his abilities.
