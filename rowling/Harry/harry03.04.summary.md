Harry enjoys his new life, although it is a bit strange to him.

Harry sees the Firebolt in his wanderings through Diagon Alley.

Harry sees The Monster Book of Monsters as required reading for his Care of
Magical Creatures class. This relieves him.

Harry goes into the shop to buy his books. He buys Unfogging the Future for his
Divination class. Harry sees a book labeled "Death Omens" but the owner advises
against reading it. Harry sees a dog similar to the one he thought he saw in
Magnolia Crescent.

Harry meets Ron and Hermione, who know that he is staying at teh Cauldren
thanks to Ron's dad. Ron says they are staying in the Cauldren as well, so
Harry can ask his dad himself why he wasn't expelled.

Hermione mentions that she is taking a large course load. She has enough to buy
an Owl. Ron comments on Egypt not agreeing with Scabbers.

They go into the Magical Menagerie, where Ron has Scabbers looked at. The
tenent there comments on Scabbers age, and his missing toe on his front paw.
Scabbers gets scared by a cat named Crookshanks, and hides.

Hermione buys Crookshanks.

The rest of the Weasley's meet the group, and have some banter. Ginny is rather
embarassed of Harry.

When they ask how they are getting to King's Landing, Mr. Weasley mentions the
Ministry is bringing cars.

The night before they leave, Percy's Head Boy badge is missing, as is Scabbers
rat tonic. As Harry goes into the hall, he hears the Weasley parents talking
about him, and his "right to know". He overhears them talk about how Black may
be after Harry. Dumbledore has even agreed to bring some Azkaban guards to
guard Hogwarts.

Harry finds the Rat tonic, gives it to Ron. Fred and George have been tinkering
with the Head Boy badge, and made it say Bighead Boy.

Harry contemplates Black as he goes to bed.
