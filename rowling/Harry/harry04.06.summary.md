Early that next morning, the Weasley's talk about the difficulty of Apperation.
George and Fred have more toffee's lined in their pockets.

Mrs. Weasley explains that, with a big event like the Quidditch World Cup, they
have to set up Portkey's to transport the wizards conspicuously without muggles
noticing.

They go to Stoatshead Hill, where the portkey nearest them is. There, they run
into Cedric and his father Amos Diggory. Cedric is the seeker for Hufflepuff.
Amos is a bit of a douche, bragging about his son.

They all grab and touch a boot, and they get transported.
