Harry meets Dobby, who describes himself as a house-elf. Dobby goes into tears
as Harry asks him to sit down, like an equal.

Dobby then begins to punish himself, saying that the Wizard Family he is a part
of lets him do that. House elves must be set free. Dobby goes on boasting about
Harry, who is modest. Eventually, Dobby gets to his point, that Harry must not
go back to Hogwarts.

Dobby says that there is some sort of plot, that it doesn't have to do with
Voldemort.

Vernon hears the noise, and scolds Harry.

Dobby reveals that he has been saving the letters, because if he thought
Harry's friends didn't care about him, he wouldn't return to Hogwarts.

When Harry doesn't promise to not go back to Hogwarts, Dobby goes down stairs
and knocks over the table.

An owl arrives, and drops a letter on Mr Mason. Mason, who is afraid of birds,
loses the deal. Vernon is obviously upset. He reads the letter to find it to be
a notice of warning of use of magic. Vernon locks Harry in his room, feeling
triumphant because he didn't realize that it was against the rules to use
magic.

Harry sits in his boarded and barred room, dreaming that he is in a zoo, and
that everyone is looking at him, and Dobby says "He is safe there." He hears
Ron on the bars outside.
