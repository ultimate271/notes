Black is eager to get at Petigrew, but Lupin stops him, urging him to let them
reveal the truth to Harry. Black consents.

Hermione says that Scabbers can't be an animagus, there is a record of who is,
and Pettigrew isn't on the list.

Lupin starts to explain. When Lupin became a werewolf, Dumbledore planted the
Willow so that Lupin could go through it, and become the werewolf in isolation
for the time.

Eventually, his friends Peter, Black, and James, become animagus to keep Lupin
company during his time as werewolf. Werewolves are only dangers to humans.
They make the Mauraders map, and sign it with their names, Sirius is Padfoot.
Peter is Wormtail. James was Prongs.

Dumbledore doesn't know that Black was an Animagus. Black had played a trick on
Snape which involved Lupin. Black told Snape about the willow, so that Snape
would come to the werewolf and die. James heard about it, and saved Snape from
encountering Lupin.

Harry then says that's why Snape doesn't like Lupin. Then Snape pulls out from
under the invisibility cloak, and points his wand at Lupin.
