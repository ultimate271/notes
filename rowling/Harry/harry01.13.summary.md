With Christmas gone, Hermione comes back, and they are sad that they don't have
more news about Nicolas Flamel.

They talk about the next quidditch match against hufflepuff, which Snape is
reffing. Ron and Hermione urge him to not play. Meanwhile, Neville is being
bullied by Malfoy, and Harry takes out a Chocolate frog to comfort him. The
card is Dumbledore's and Harry sees Nicolas Flamel on the back of it.

Hermione is excited, and pulls out a book saying that Flamel is the only one to
successfully construct a sorcerers stone.

Harry resolves to play in the quidditch match. He becomes even more apprensive
of Snape.

The quidditch match goes on, and Ron and Hermione are ready to counteract Snape
at any moment. Malfoy taunts Neville, and Ron has enough of it and wrestles
him. Harry grabs the snitch in the first five minutes of the game, and
Dumbledore is proud of him for it.

As Harry leaves the locker room, he sees Snape cloaked going into the forest.
He eavsdrops him talking with Quirrell about the sorcerers stone.

Back at the hall, Harry tells them about this, and they think that Quirrell is
the only thing stopping Snape from getting the stone.
