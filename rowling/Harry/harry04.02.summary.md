Harry wakes from a dream, which is uncannily similar to what happened in the
last chapter. Harry is warry of Voldemert being near, but shakes himself off as
being paranoid. We go over a bit about Quidditch, and a bit about the day when
Harry was only a year old.

Harry contemplates writing to Ron and Hermione about his scar hurting and what
they would say.

Harry then decides to write to Sirius. We get some background of what happened
in the last book with Sirius. He writes the letter and sends it with Hedwig.
