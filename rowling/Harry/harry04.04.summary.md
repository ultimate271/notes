The Dursley's are apprehensive about the Weasley's coming to pick Harry up.

Five o'clock roles around, and the Weasley's are late. Eventually, Vernon
screams as the Weasley's attempt to come through the blocked fireplace. After
breaking through the barrier, Arthur explains about how they added this
fireplace to the Floo Network temporarily.

After the Weasley twins get Harry's bags, and Arthur attempts to make more
conversation, they reignite the fireplace and go back through with Floo Powder.

As Harry is about to go, Dudley's tongue starts to turn purple. The Weasley
twins had given him some toffee enchanted with the Engorgment Charm.

Arthur insists Harry goes while he fixes up the situation there.
