# The letters from no one.
## Preparing for school
It' about time for school to start, and Dudley is all preped out in his new
uniform.

Mrs. Dursley is washing some of Dudley's old uniforms to hand down to Harry.

## The first letter
One day, when the mail comes in, Mr. Dursley asks Harry to get it, and he sees
a piece of mail addressed to him. It even has the location of "The cupboard
under the stairs." The Dursley's freak out about it, and burn the letter. Mrs.
Dursley has Harry go and stay in Dudley's second bedroom.

## More letters after that
The next day, a similar pices of mail appears. They freak out again.

Harry comes up with a plan to sneak to the room and intercept the mail before
the Dursley's can catch him. However, he is foiled when he finds Mr. Dursley
sleeping in a sleeping bag at the front desk. Six letters eventually slide
through the mail slot addressed to Harry. Mr Dursley nails up the mail slot in
response.

The next day, a dozen letters come through the cracks in the door. The
Dursley's nail up the cracks in the door.

Two dozen letters get hidden in the egges that the milk man gives them.

On Sunday, Mr Dursley is happy because mail doesn't arrive. However, letters
start pouring in to the chimney. Mr. Dursley's gathers everyone up and they go
to a hotel.

## They go to a hotel
At the hotel, Harry is still getting letters. Mr. Dursley then takes them all
to go to a boat where there is no chance of receiving any letters.

Harry realizes that his eleventh birthday is the next day on the trip.

## The knock on the boat
On the boat, when Harry is counting the seconds, they hear a large "BOOM" that
is the knock of someone trying to come in.
