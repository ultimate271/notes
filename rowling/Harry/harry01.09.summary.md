Harry's spirits are lowered when he gets a note that Gryffindors and
Slytherin's are to take flying lessons together. This means he will have to
learn flying with Malfoy. We get learn about Hermione, Ron, Neville, Malfoy,
and Seamus's positions on Quidditch.

Neville gets a Rememberall, and Malfoy comes to pick it up. McGonagall stops
any trouble before it can begin.

During flying lesson's, Madame Hooch begins to teach the basics of flying, but
Neville manages to hurt himself before they even take flight. Hooch takes him
to the Infirmary, and Malfoy finds his Rememberall and plays keep away with
Harry. McGonagall sees him flying and snatches him away. Harry has horrors of
being expelled, but instead, McGonagall fetches a boy named Wood, a fifth year
captian of the Gryffindor team, and makes Harry his seeker.

Later, a salty Malfoy comes to Harry in the great hall and challenges him to a
wizard duel. Ron accepts and agrees to be his second.

On the way out at midnight, Hermione inturrupts them, and gets locked out of
the Gryffindor tower with them, the fat lady is gone. Neville is in the hall,
because he forgot the password. The group of four makes it to the trophy room.

They realize that Malfoy never intended to come, it was a setup and that Filch
was in the trophy room. They run into Peeves the ghost, and Peeves yells that
there are students in the halls. The group of four gets away by going into a
locked door.  They realize that the door they went into was the forbidden
corridor, and that there was a three headed dog gaurding a trapdoor. They run
from the dog, and manage to get back to the Gryffindor tower before getting
caught or eaten.
