There is a house in a village called Little Hangleton that those there call The
Riddle House. One day a maid walks in to find all three Riddles dead.

The cook says it was Frank Bryce, the Riddles gardener. Frank is arrested, but
insists on his innocence, and says that it was a boy. But when the bodies are
examined, and no cause of murder is found, Frank is absolved, and the bodies
are buried at the church there. Frank continues to live in the house.

The current owner doesn't live there, but just pays Frank to keep it orderly.

One day, Frank sees a room upstairs with the lights on. When Frank goes to
investigate, he hears mens voices. The first voice, Wormtail, is feeding
something in a bottle to the second, which is icy cold. Wormtail asks how long
they plan to stay, and Voldemort says they should wait to enact their plan
until the Quidditch World Cup is over.

Voldemorts mentions Wormtail milking Nagini.

Wormtail suggests using another wizard besides Potter. Voldemort is not pleased
with this suggestion, and cruely reminds Wormtail of his plan. Wormtail
mentions "Bertha Jorkins's" disappearance.

Voldermort says that he has great plans for Wormtail, greater than his plans
for Bertha Jorkins.

Frank realizes that Voldemort had murdered Bertha, and planned to murder Harry
as well. As he is about to gtfo, a 12 foot long snake slithers by. Frank
freezes, and Voldemort says to Wormtail that Nagini has informed him that there
is a muggle in the hallway.

Voldemort tells Wormtail to invite him in, and Frank walks in to the room.
Voldemort is facing the fireplace in an armchair, with Nagini coiled up on the
side. Frank can't see him at all.

At Voldemort's request, Wormtail turns the chair. Frank sees "Something
horrible" and with a flash of green light, is killed. 200 miles away, Harry
wakes with a start.
