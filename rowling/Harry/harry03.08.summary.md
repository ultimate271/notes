Time goes on. Dark arts is fun, potions sucks, and Divination and Magical
creatures becomes dull.

Oliver Wood gives a motivational speech to the Gryffindor quidditch team.

Hermione and Ron are excited about going to Hogsmeade, but Harry is sad that he
can't go.

Crookshanks, Hermione's cat, goes after Scabbers, Ron's mouse. Ron is upset
about it.

In transfiguration, Harry is going to ask McGonagall to go to Hogsmeade, but
Lavender Brown is crying. Parvati was comforting her, and Seamus and Dean
Thomas were observing. Lavender's rabbit died on the day that the divination
prof predicted it. Hermione refutes the claim with logic.

McGonagall asks for Hogsmeade slips. Harry asks if he can go without one, and
McGonagall denies. Harry is sad that he can't go.

In the common room, Colin bugs Harry and asks why he's not at Hogsmeade. Harry
is undecided about where to go and wanders the halls. He runs into Filch, and
on the way to the owlery, hears Lupin calling him.

They have some casual conversation, and Harry asks Lupin why he didn't let him
face the Boggart. Lupin says because he thought Voldemort would appear (and
Harry is struck by his use of the word Voldemort), but Harry reveals that he
thought it would be a dementor instead.

Snape comes in and hands Lupin a goblet. Lupin downs it, and that concludes
their conversation.

Ron and Hermione come back from Hogsmeade, and they talk about how awesome it
was. Harry tells them about the goblet, and they think Snape may be trying to
poison Lupin for the Dark Arts position.

They feast. On the way back to the dorms, they see that the Fat Lady guarding
the Gryffindor dorms has been slashed up. Dumbledore comes down to get to the
bottom of it, and Peeves the Poltergeist reveals that it was Sirus Black who
slashed her up.
