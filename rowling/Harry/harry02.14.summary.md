The trio speculate about Hagrid, and decide to lay off asking him about the
whole thing. He was in Knockturn alley though.

Life goes by, and there isn't another attack. April comes by, and the group has
to choose their classes for the next year. Harry isn't sure what to pick.

Harry is really busy with Quidditch and homework. One day, Neville alerts him
taht his stuff has been raided. The diary is missing. They decide not to report
the missing book.

Then, before a quidditch match, Harry hears the voice again. Hermione has a
revalation, and rushes to the library. Harry continues to the game.

Just before the game starts, McGonagall announces taht the game has been
canceled, and taht everyone should go back to the dorms. McGonagall instructs
Harry to come with her. Ron as well.

There was another attack, the Ravenclaw girl that Harry and Ron asked for
directions when they were Crabbe and Goyle, and Hermione. Hermione has a small
circular mirror.

In the dorms, the students notice that Slythins are the only ones not victims.
Harry and Ron decide to get out the invisiblity cloak again and visit Hagrid.

The halls are crowded, but they make their way through. Hagrid is visibly
nervous, and waiting for someone. There is a knock, and the duo hide back under
the cloak, and go into the corner.

It's Dumbledore with Conelious Fudge, Minister of Magic. Fudge says his hands
are tied, and that he has to take Hagrid to Azkaban, as a precaution. As they
are talking, Lucious Malfoy steps in, and announces that all twelve of the
Wizard Governer council have signed for Dumbledore's removal. Dumbledore
graciously steps down, but makes note that he will give help to Hogwarts to
those that ask for it.

Hagrid makes note that all you have to do is follow the spiders.

When they all leave, Hagrid gives a grim prediction for the school.
