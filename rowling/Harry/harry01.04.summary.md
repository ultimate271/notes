# Hagrid comes in and informs Harry that he is a wizard
## First encounter
Hagrid bursts into the room. He's big, with a bushy beard.

The Dursley's threaten Hagrid and tell him to leave. Mr. Dursley even aims a
revolver at him, but Hagrid just bends it into a knot.

## Hagrid begins to explain to Harry whats going on
Hagrid gives Harry a cake, and introduces himself as the Keeper of Keys and
Grounds at Hogwarts. He gives out some sausages for Harry to eat.

Harry asks who he is, and Hagrid begins to realize that he doesn't know
anything about his wizard upbringing.

Throughout, Mr. Dursley attepmts to inturrupt and stop Hagrid, but Hagrid has
none of it.

Hagrid gives Harry his letter of acceptance that he should have gotten from his
birth.

Hagrid writes a letter to Dumbledore and gives it to an owl that flies off.

## Upon realizing that Harry doesn't know about his upbringing, Hagrid explains
Hagrid then explains more about Voldemort. Voldemort was a wizard that went bad
and began to gather wizards to his side. Dumbledore is the only wizard that
Voldemort feared. When Voldemort tried to kill Harry's parents, he killed them,
but couldn't kill Harry, and he's disappeared since then.

Harry recalls some of the strange things that have happened to him when he gets
really upset.

## Conclusion of the first encounter
Mr. Dursley stands up to Hagrid another time, and Hagrid finally loses it and
turns him into a pig. He just grows a tail because, "He was already a pig
anyway."

At this, Hagrid explains that he is not allowed to use magic, because he was
expelled from Hogwarts, but shrugs it off.

He gives Harry a cloak, and they go to bed for the night.
