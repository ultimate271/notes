Harry does homework in the summer under his covers. He writes about witch
burnings. Wendilin the Weird actually enjoyed being burned for amusement.

About the Dursley's.

Ron calls, Vernon picks up, and is furious at Harry. Hermione doesn't call
either.

Vernon allows Hedwig to go out at night as long as Harry doesn't send letters.

Harry gazes out the window late at night on his birthday. Hedwig is out.
Outside, two owls holding another come in. The held one is Errol, the Weasley
owl, and one of the holding owls is Hedwig. He dosen't recognize the third, but
all three have a package, and the third has one from Hogwarts. The third owl
leaves.

He opens Errol's package. Inside is a bday card and a clip from the Daily
Prophet. Arthur Weasley won a Galleon Draw, and the whole family is to spend
time in Egypt with Bill. Ron is in the picture with Scabbers and the rest of
the Weasley's.

Ron's letter. He's excited, he's getting a new wand. He wants to meet Harry in
London. Percy is also Head Boy. The package has a "Pocket Sneakoscope" which
lights up and spins when someone is untrustworthy.

Hedwig has a note from Hermione. Hermione's package has a Broomstick Servicing
Kit.

The last package is from Hagrid. It's a rather animated Monster Book of
Monsters. He reads Hagrid's note, which promises the book will come useful.

The last note is from Hogwarts. As a third year, he is allowed, with permission
from his guardians, to visit Hogsmeade, an all wizard village. Harry is not
sure how he will get permission, but goes to sleep.
