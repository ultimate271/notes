# About the Blog
I feel it is neccesary to lay out my plans for what geraldorbweaver.com represents, and everything else that I plan to tie it to. I probably will not publish this article verbatim, but it has to be written regardless. And maybe I will publish this article verbatim, in which case, hello from "train of consciousness Brett".

So the only reason I feel an article like this is appropiate is because I launched the website with a handful of articles all at once, and then did nothing with it. I want to justify myself here.

The website in its current state is in something of an "open-beta" version, and I won't consider it live until some of these points below start to happen. So this is the lay out of my vision for Nirvana when it comes to geraldorbweaver.com.

## Articles
The core aspect of this blog that I want to be brought forth is a regular (every week, or more likely every other week) entry that will be the "Mainstay" entry for the blog. This entry will be on the front page, and it will be prominently linked throughout the blog. I want the mainstay to be a regular story. I want it to be extractable from the blog, so that it can stand alone as a novella, or even a novel. When one mainstay finishes, another one will begin. I am inclined to say that the website is officially "live" when I set up this mainstay, and set up a subscription service for it.

Beyond that, I want to have other stories, or chains, that I can add to as I please. Some of them I will plan to add to as I feel inspired, and others I will assign a more rigourous schedule to. The idea on these is to have shorter, but more frequent entries, to have something that people can browse when they are feeling bored. These entries will be less commitment then the mainstay.  Most of these entries will look similar to what is currently on the blog.

I have also decided to begin getting my feet wet in image creation and vector graphics, so at some point, when I am less embarrased about the symbols I am creating, I will start publishing some of my art from that work. In the mean time, I'm stuck just posting my scanned, hand-drawn images, so that's all there is to talk about with that at this point.

## Web design
Right now, everything is done through wordpress, but I hope for that to change as I get this entire thing figured out. I am not a web designer, but I know a thing or two about setting up websites, so we will see how this evolves as life goes on. The biggest thing will just be making sure to remember that the blog needs to evolve occasionally, on top of the regular updates that go in to it.

At some point, I want to make this "My Web Project" so that I can develop my web design skills. This idea is very far off (over a year, if not more), but I want to have a full, functioning, web-application that people can log in to that they can use to just play around with the cool applications that I write.  Since software development is my job, I am less inclined to work on this side of things "for the fun of it," but at some point I will decide that I need to develop web development skills, and when that happens, expect tons of changes to the site.

## Beyond
I plan for everything that I provide through geraldorbweaver.com and all related services to be entirely free. I could go in to the whole song and dance about "Freedom" and "Openness" and "Collaboration" and so on, but I will spare you all of that nonsense and just say that the fact that the blog is "free" is more symbolic of what it represents then anything else.

Of course, we could look at this from the other angle, and we could say that I am taking a google approach to this where I make all of the services free so that when people get attached to them I can sell their information to advertisers. I could just be a shrewd businessman, and the "freedom" of the blog could just be a business decision.

So I want to clarify. This is not a business decision. This is a decision about the blog. The blog is free, and it will always be free. It will be free not only in the monetary sense, but also in every other sense of the word "free" which is appropiate here. It is "The place where ideas grow" and giving ideas the freedom to grow is the first step in that.

## The present
What does any of this mean for now?

I plan to continue to write articles as I feel like it, but I will make sure that I write at least one every week from this point. As I start to develop more material, it will be clear which aspects of the blog should become the mainstay. From there, it's just a matter of bringing the vision to life.

For now, if all of that sounds awesome and you want to get involved, unfortunately the only way to do that at this point is to connect with Brett Webster the man on a personal level. Shoot an email to author@geraldorbweaver.com and I'll respond appropiately. In the future, things like subscriptions, patreon, user accounts, and so forth, will be added, but there are too many things to do in life, and not enough time to do them. We have to pick our battles.
