# Meditation

I am not qualified to talk about meditation, but I am going to do it anyway.

## What is Meditation

> Meditation: The act or practice of meditating.
> Oxford english dictionary

At first it seemed wrong to put such a non-sensical and circular definiton as
the beginning of this section but on second glance it seemed appropiate that
this one go first.

> Meditate: (Verb) Focus one's mind for a period of time, in silence or with
> the aid of chanting, for religous or spiritual purposes or as a method of
> relaxation.
> Oxford English Dictionary

This second defintion is very broad but does the job.

> Meditation is the art of dedicating a standard time window on a regular
> frequency towards a noble aim.
> Gerald Orbweaver English Dictionary (Blog Edition)
