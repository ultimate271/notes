In there land there was a king. As far as kings go, this king was what his
critics would call "okay",never extraordinary, but still keeping to his kingly
duties and generally doing with kind heart what was expected of him as king. He
was a figurehead for a farming town during a time of peace and prosperity. The
king owned a crown, but he never wore it except to very special occasions where
it was worn as a decorative piece briefly before it is placed to the side.
Things were what any pragmatic observer of the situation would call good.

As all mortal men of this world do, this king began to age, and as he aged he
did not acquire ever a queen to be with. He considered the whole hereditary
monarchy thing that he was born in to to be a foolish way of living, but he
didn't feel so strongly to do anything about it. He was a king after all, and
he was treated very well. But not only did this king feel this way about the
system he was born in, he also considered himself a much more free and
independent individual if he spent his time pursuing other interests besides
those of wedding bells. And he did. This king spent his time being a member of
the people as much as he did being king. It was no secret when the king would
leave the castle, but he would change his dress and appearance dramatically by
removing his pompous make up (which he dreaded having put on him for fourty
minutes each morning) and fixing his attire to be much more pedestrian, but
never peasently. In this way, he would leave his place of living and work and
fraternize with his people. The king was much to busy with his pedestrian
interests, not to mention his obligation to his work, that work being kingly
work but still the same burden of work that all humans are born with, to bother
himself with what he would call his complementary sex. No, women only
interested him sensually and not intellectually, and this man was only
intellectual enough to know that he wasn't intellectual enough to go against
his intellectuality. And going with his intelect, this man became would become
the last of his bloodline of kings, this seeming somehow appropiate to the part
of the king that kept him up at night.

Of course, further thought by the king led him to think that most likely the
next in line of royal blood will be put in his place after his death, and that
some new bloodline will begin. But so be it, the king would say to himself
after coming to this realization. It's the gesture more than the actual result
that concerned him, and the gesture was no cost to his well being, so he might
as well make it even if it didn't make a difference one way or another to his
legacy.

And so the king lived on like this, living with his people in the time that he
wasn't governing the people, and preparing things in order to allow continued
prosperous growth. Under his leadership the people saw continued overall
increase in crop growth, ability of craftsmen went up and their costs of labor
went down, and what was once a road carved by the wheels of the travelers
became smooth clear lines of roadway woven throughout the peoples that lived
on that land.

The people were happy with their king, and the king was happy with his people.
Perhaps too happy. He had reached his end. He saw the people he governed grow
from the innocent beginnings of settlization to a well organized social group,
and he knew the part he had to play in it was no more. He was becoming old, and
weary of this world. The king wanted to gain enjoyment out of the growth he
once knew, but he couldn't knowing that his involvment was being filtered out
and replaced by the very system which he put in place. It was a beautiful
thing.

In his later years, the king grew nihilistic. "Why should I go the extra mile
to govern my people if a mile short will do and I can run two fewer miles than
I would otherwise," would be something the king might say to his trusted
friends in a time of late night inebriation that was becoming only too common.

Of course, the king didn't want to lose interest in the things that once gave
him joy, but old age without a mate was wearing on him, and the began to
realize the error in rejecting a mate earlier in life. He was only too aware of
the pains in his soul that he was missing for not having shared in another
human being his sexual and emotional energy, and more for not having received
that same sexual and emotional energy. Indeed, he knew that the glass that
never receives water sits on the shelf and collects dust, but he didn't realize
the ramifications of that dust until it was only to physically manifest in
himself.

So he would sit there, an old, accomplished, unmarried king, and he would
contemplate his life. He would lose himself in his own thought, revisit past
glories in imagination and reflect on past mistakes in trance. Indeed, he
became more concerned with the world of his imagination than with the world
that he was responsible to, the world we are all responsible to.

This is all well and good when a farmer who shares a similar life passes on the
workings of his labor to an heir and dies peacefully in the care of medical
men, but due to the nature of the Hereditary Monarchy which this king was born
into, his kingly duties were bound to him until his death.

As you may imagine, this caused a good unrest in the people. At first they
could excuse the kings lack of action to a possible slump. Everyone has times
when they lose hope and lose energy in the world, and most that are able to
stick around are able to last through that slump and come out on the other end
rejuvinated and full of life. However, when the king continued to lock himself
in his quarters and only did the minimum of what was required of him by his
people for many a year on end, to the point where this behavior was only
getting worse and not better, the people began to cause unrest.

"Why is our king sitting idly in his quarters while we farmers are waiting for
news which impacts the growth of our crop? What ill have we done to him that he
would rather live isolated apart from that which has been so beneficial to him?
To anything do we owe this king of ours so that he may come out? Can we perhaps
bribe him or otherwise encourage him to return to his duties? For how much
longer should we tolerate this immature and innappropiate behavior?"

These were only a selection of questions that the townspeople had for the king.
And the king, being not totally removed from his people, gave this reply to his
people, "Are you not grateful? Have I not been good to you? The years since I
have sucked my mothers tit I was responsible for your well-being, and your
well-being I kept for many long years since then. Count them! Alas, a farmhand
may have harder work than I, but when he grows old the youth take his role. Not
so for me! I only wish to be free from my burdens so I may pass in peace from
this world, but since my family and my government won't allow that, I ask that
you only give me this one indulgance. Please do not disturb me when I am in
thought, and let me do as I wish as a human being on this planet Earth."

The people, having heard this reply, were taken aback. Indeed, there was
nothing they had done to cause this action by the king, and nothing they could
do to right it. At least so it seemed until, after many fruitless years with
the king in this state, one of the people spoke up.

"There are mountains far to the west of here where a great beast is said to
sleep. It is told that he does not sleep in this world, but in another, and to
wake him we must go to this hallowed place, and perform the ritual taught to us
and practiced to by our forefathers, and by performing such a right at such a
place, we can penetrate the barrier of this world and summon this beast, this
dragon, from the next. Come with me, now, all of you, so we may summon this
dragon and tell him of our plight, for the dragon is said to be wise, and
perhaps he will have the solution to our problems."

At first the people were of course reluctanct to summon a beast from another
world to ours just so they could ask him about our socio-political issues of
the day, but as time grew more and crops grew less, eventually the will of the
mass turned to action.
