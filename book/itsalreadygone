Today

Wake up

It's 4 am.

Hmm.

Am I awake or will I go back to sleep?

Hmm.

Well.

It seems.

At least so far.

That I am still awake.

Indeed, if I were awake,

and I placed by hands together,

they might collide;

but if i dream

They will transport through eachother

But indeed, I wake.

4:15

Okay, smoke something.

Grab the bong.

Wake and bake.

4:35

Read music on the laptop

lounging comfortably

Content with what you are doing

All is well with the world.

5:05

Grab some water.

Contemplate your situation

Work at eight.

Awake by 7:20

Stirring by 7:40

Work by 8:10

Cycle back to 6:50 6:20 5:50 5:20

Boom

Hit current time

Analysis complete, check at these intervals for sleepiness.

Indeed, by 7:10 I was tired.

But something is wrong, I said awake by 7:20

I was.

7:20

Paralyzed, cannot move limbs, surrender to another cycle of sleep

7:40

I have to get up, on good cycle in.

Prepare to get up

7:55

Shit, I hit another cycle, get up for real time now.

...
...
...
...

By the way, these explicitly were not the events of any particular morning of mine, merely a dramitization of my morning routine

Indeed, the morning of today went like this.

6:20

Wake up,

Contemplate wake and bake.

Concede to small wake and bake.

6:35

After a short microsleep session, ready myself for intake.

Sit down, stupid night me hadn't prepared before hand, but that was no obstacle.

Grab a tuft of marijuana, grind it, pop a tiny ammount into a vessel, with which to inhale fire through the bong.

Light fire through the bong.

Hmm, okay.

Lawyer day.

Evaluate.

I will meet with him at 3:00, that is 8 hours from now.

That is my lunch break. Work from now until then.

Take a cold shower, last for 3 minutes or so.

Dry off, brush teeth.

Deoderent, underwear, shirt, pants.

Gi needs washing, exchange laundry.

Drink some orange juice. Straight out of the container like a man.

Not much though, just a sip.

7:40 Dressed, packed, and ready to leave.

Boom, Alliant work, writing bad VB since 2007

Survive to 12:30

Set up in conference for time with Valerie

1:00

Training session with Valerie

1:30

Training session basically over, go into Q&A

Talk about various things for many minutes

Learn she is actually working two jobs right now.

Interesting

2:00

Okay, evaluate, have to get to lawyer by 3:00.

I know Denton is a decent drive away, especially on highway 35.

Check google, 35 minute drive, add 5 for walking, leaving 17 to prepare and 3 for leeway.

Easy game easy life, drive my way to Denton, arrive at the Lawyer precisely at 2:59, greet ammicabbly with him

A transcript of this conversation would be boring. [The only thing that needs to be said] is it lasted fifty five full minutes.

2:55

I'm not sure about this guy, seems legit, but I don't know. I'll consider it over a joint.

3:03

Stopping to get gas, fuck am I late for work.

4:46

Expected time to get to work.

Oh fuck.

I forgot I keep the car clock on real time (Because fuck daylight savings time, although that's another story)

Hmmm

Evaluate

Left work at 2:17, expected arrival 4:46 difference of two and a half hours.

Long lunch.

All good

6:18

Leave Alliant as Valerie waits out the storm

6:20

Walk outside, feels immaculate outside.

The storm is anticipating what? Nobody knows

See lightning.

Hear thunder

7 beats, 1.4 miles.

4 beats 1200 meters

Fascinating.

Strike in the distance,

Never hear it, probably at least five miles away.

Turn on the usual streets.

Rain

5:36

Car clock, light rain

5 :38

Heavy rain.

5:39

Wipers on full, windows all the way up

Windows peeked.

5:40

Car clock.

Look to the right as I drive down Royal lane.

Contemplate my role in the place of Zues and the wrath of his thunderbolts.

BOOM!

I know I saw it first. Red on the building, followed by a stream of lightning meeting it,

I heard it before I knew I would hear it, but as soon as I heard it I knew that this is exactly as short amount of time as I would have heard it.

Meaning, I saw it, and I heard it, and it made me feel power, like life and death weren't in my hands, because they are not, and fortunately we trust the power of lightning rods.

Probably 7:00 ish

Smoke a bunch of weed, write this.

QED bitches, lawyer this shit! 

8:19

Present moment

Writing as I watch the clock

Waiting to wrrite the next time I see

Will it happen?

Stay tuned

For the next chapter

of this saga

from now

until forever
and ever

and 

at 8:20

it goes on and on and on and on my friends

are the lyrics to a song that has no end

because when people started singing it they remembered their childhood

and then they remember that their childhood had a distinct end.

So yeah.

Um, still the same time apparently.

This is nuts.

There 8:21

Okay, so this isn't any sort of dick measuring contest or anything, but honestly

how many words do you think I could fit in here? Probably quite a few huh? Maybe a decent
ammount, enough to read and say, yeah, that's a lot of words, I remember reading a lot of 
them in books, like the dictionary, and others like the thesaurus. And then there was this
other book about 

8:22

something else that I don't remember, and when it all comes down to it, I really just want this
 to be a stream of cnosioeutnsss, but really its just a conglamoration of all my thoughts and ideas
 brought down into word fromat and placed itno bubbles that defy the l

 8:23

laws of laws and stuff. Like, while we are here fucking ranting, fuck this entire system man.

Like what, you don't want me to smoke weed I get it, but shit is literally curing cancer,

mild forms sure, but it is noticably and measurably helping peaple

8:24

and yet I am put in prison, with convicts, mind you, that 

Hmm

It seems my mind has blocked the words here

8:25

Interesting

I've moved on to a new train of thought.

This one is entirely seperate from the one before it, and makes a narrative flow

that entagles you and makes you want more out of what you are reading.

After doing that, I will enchant you with ideas of magic, maybe some girl who can 
use magic but doesn't know about her powers will work to overcome the struggle of the dominion
of those around her, and as she does so she begins to learn that only she is the barrier to
learning to navigate the world around her, and that she can do with it what she will taht is
in her power, making her not a god but instead of tyrant, and as any good tyrant, she would
become evenutally corrupt. But alas, this tyrant was still innocent, so innocent infact that
to call her a tyrant would be only a matter of sementics rather than of chareacter, because
this girl was as pure as they come.

So after having convinced you of how independent and stuff this girl is, I will thien lead 
you on a magical ride to disrupt the evil police force and create rioting in the streets and 
rise up a magestical rule and create a movement and become a leader and take down an evil bad guy, and stuff.

Do all of it.

And thats the writing of sanderson in a nutshell.

At least the first book.

I mostly understand how it goes, I start browesing the other ones soon.

I will skip the second one, the third will be better this way.

Please don't spoil what happens in the second one for me.

8:30

Do I really want to learn Russian? Kind of, yeah.

And since I'm going to be on Probation for the forseeable future, at least till 2020, I should occupy myself with something that is totally outside of the realm of things I curretly know.

At this moment, I feel as though I want to make an oath to learn russian, but that would be out of the spirit of Tolkien, who knew a thing or two about some stuff, so instead of making it an oath I make it my goal to pursue the love a language so that I may some day visit Europe and speak to natives in their tongue.

What a beautiful goal that would be.

And to perhaps live there for a time.

In the cold, beautiful weather.

My life, in Northern Europe.

Speaking the slavic and the germanic langauges.

Beautiful.

Foreseeable?

Perhaps.

Depends on the first.

Russian will be my first.

I love the freedom that russian Grammer seems to give, focusing more on keeping standard alterations of words (with exceptions as any good language might have) rather than relying on sentence structure. The lack of articles excites me, as well as the foreign alphebet. Learning that will take at least some months, but typing out something like the brothers Karamov I feel is most definitely a magnificent way to learn the most exquisite russian. Indeed, why not the best russian? Of course it makes sense.

Now, to find it and copy it, ohh, that will be the occupation of myself for a good time every day. Yes, magnificent. I like it. Learning Russian.

And perhaps too, meeting a Russian friend, and not revealing to him that I know any russian, but instead just listening if he ever speaks it.

And then, perhaps meeting a pen pal, but over the internet, and I teach them Russian and they teach me English. Or something like that.

And who knows, maybe well down the line I visit there somewhere, to live and experience the world as it is out there.

In a world where the don't speak english. How amazing must that be?

Learn in this probation.

This is your time in jail.

Two years clean Judge.

How much longer you want me to grow my hair?

Boom.

Get fucked.

Long hair

No weed.


The retribution of 2020

Learning Russian

Like a boss

2 years, like a babe.

Learning letters.

Writing letters.

Reading letters

saying letters

learning words

writing words

etc etc etc etc

forever and ever

russian bitch

A new entire language.

In two years it can be done.

I will prove it.

Boom.

Lets fuckin

go.

By the way, learning to swear in a language is important for two reasons.

One, because when you hear other people swear, you know what they are say.

Two, so that you can say the swear words.

So never neglect the use of swear words in a literary work. Fuck. See, included it.

8:41

Resolute on my quest to learn Russian, I remember that I intend to go on probation beginning (personally)

June 11, 2018 6:00 AM

Meaning I wish to be tested for urinalisis 30 days later on

July 10
