So I want to write this as a sort of free form response to a podcast between
Peterson and Harris, a podcast that has become somewhat infamous as of late,
where Harris and Peterson famously got into a quabble over the definition of
truth.

In a nutshell, their conversation came to talking about two different ways of
defining truth. These two have since continued on talking about their
differeneces, and have had many discussions about this topic to the point where
they have at least been able to understand their disagreement, even if they
haven't come to any sort of consensus about the heart of what has the deepest
meaning to them.

But the seed of this discussion is me taking the place of Harris in their
discussion. There is a point that Harris seemed to begin to make, that I want
to elaborate on, and where I want to draw what I consider a rather large
realization for me about my understanding of the relationship of myth and
material fact, and in this discussion, it leads to this realization. There is
almost certainly a better way of coming to this realization, but this is the
way that I have come to it, and it's the way that I want to get to it again,
and when it comes out this way, I may come, in the future, to talk about it
again.

So the core of their disagreement came down to the talking about truth. Jordan
took the position of what was later termed by Bret Weinstien as Metaphorical
Truth. Metaphorical truths are those truths which, when the recipiant believes
this truth, give them a greater level of fitness than those that do not believe
these truths.

The best example I have of a metaphorical truth, or at least, the most clear
cut and uncontroversial example that gets at the distinction between these two
truths, is an example that has been used to talk about gun safety.

Imagine there is some individual from Mars. He grew up on Mars, and developed
in Mars, and now, for whatever reason, he has come to the Earth and wants to
learn about the doings of the Earthmen. Now, suppose he wants to learn about
guns. He knows nothing about guns, and nothing about how guns are used in our
society, so it's our job to educate him on everything he needs to know about
guns.

So the pure materialist would hand the Martian a gun, and then proceed to give
a lecture about the different workings of the gun. He would say that the gun is
made of a handle, with a trigger, and he would talk about the spring mechanisms
that go into the trigger, about the firing mechanism of the hammer onto the
firing powder, he would talk about the use of magazines, he would describe the
function of the safety switch, and if everything is grasped by the Martian to
this point, he might go on about the physics of air pressure, thermodynamics,
and related phenomenon that actually allow the bullet to be fired from the gun.
All of these things would be considered all of the facts about the gun as an
objective entity.

So now, at this point, we have to ask ourselves, has the Martian learned
everything we know about the gun? The answer to this seems like an almost
certain no. We haven't taught the Martian about proper gun firing techniques,
we haven't warned him about gun safety, we haven't told him about the way that
a gun should be held, or the best way to aim the gun. We have only told him the
facts about the objects of the gun.

Now, it could be argued that the Martian, equipped with some level of deductive
reasoning, could derive these sorts of things that we haven't told him based
upon solely the objective facts of the gun. It is unclear whether or not this
is possible. But even suppossing that this sort of analytical train of ideas is
entirely possible, the Martian needs something else besides the facts about the
gun to be able to derive these facts about how to use the gun. There are still
some other facts that we need to give the Martian, whether those facts are
about deductive reasoning, or whether those facts are the conclusions of that
reasoning, in order for him to convey to him our entirety of knowledge about
the gun. By only giving him just the objective elements of the shape and makeup
of the gun, we have only given him part of our knowledge about guns, and
something more must be added to this in order to give our complete knowledge,
something that cannot be added just by describing the totality of objective
facts about the gun.

It also could be argued, and this is the argument that Peterson I believe was
attempting to arrive at, that these metaphorical truths about the gun are more
important than the objective facts about the gun. That is, for our Martian,
it's more important that he learn gun safety and gun usage than he learn the
mechanism by which the hammer strikes the bullet. The notion of thermodynamics
is certainly not the most essential piece of knowledge that we would like to
protray to the Martian about the gun. So it is in this way that we talk about a
sort of revaluation of the word truth. We say, since the objective facts about
the makeup of the gun are not at all the most important things that could be
said about it, it is then appropiate to define truth in such a way to give
those facts which have the most importance to the Martian as the "most true"
facts about the gun.

This argument seems appealing, and I am not arguing that these metaphorical or
"Darwinian" truths are not the most important truths. I'm not arguing the
converse either, because it could very easily be argued that there are some
contexts in which the objective facts about the gun are the most important
things. For instance, an engineer would want to know about the force with which
the hammer needs to strike the bullet in order for there to be an actuating
force, and to calculate the distance and force that the hammer needs to travel
to reach that terminal point would require that he understand and grasp all of
the objective facts about the gun, and of all of the ways in which the
mechanisms of the gun behave in the context of Newtonian physics. In this
context, the objective facts about the gun are the most important things to
talk about. My point here is, I am not trying to make an argument that certain
kinds of truths are more important than others in whatever context, that notion
is seperate to the notion of our definition of what truth should mean.

So to re-evaluate truth this way seems in a way appropiate. The maxim here
which I think best illustrates the metaphorical truth of the gun is that "every
gun is loaded."

Now, there are a few ways that you could present this truth. This way is one of
the strongest ways that it can be presented. A stronger version might be "every
gun is always loaded all the time no matter how much you think it's not," and a
weaker way would be to say "treat every gun as if it is loaded." What this does
is it talks about the level on which you should believe this fact.

Now, we can talk about the utility of this statement. It's rather clear that
those that would believe this to be true would be more fit in a darwinian
sense than those that would not take this belief. It would be quite dangerous
for two people to play cops and robbers with real firearms, even if they had
examined them beforehand, because it's always possible that someone made a
mistake. So the belief that "every gun is loaded" would prohibit someone from
playing this game. Because every gun is loaded, someone might argue, when you
fire, it will fire at the person. Therefore, you should not play this game.

It's also not entirely clear at what level of belief is correct here. For
instance, it seems to me that the actual belief that there is a bullet in the
chamber would be a stronger belief than the belief that "you should treat it as
if"
