Preamble

Backstory, Adam and Eve tell the story of Cain and Abel to Seth

Premeeting, Cain finds his way to Seth's cabin. He enters, and begins
conversation.

Quickly, Cain mentions Abel, and Seth asks the story. Cain gives his side of
the story.

Seth accuses Cain of devilish words, but they end up laughing together about
it.

Cain addresses the stories of their parents, and tells Seth about the
mushrooms.

Seth, after telling Cain that he knows nothing about these mushrooms, asks Cain
about God.

Seth begins to cry, and saying that he doesn't know who to trust.

Cain assures Seth of his strength against their parents.

Seth asks how Cain knows his fate.

Seth tries to convince Cain to stay. Cain disagrees, explaining his reasoning.
Cain brings up killing their mom and dad.

Seth continues to try and get to Cain, but Cain reminds Cain that his strength
comes from within. It doesn't come from Mom and Dad, and it doesn't come from
him. It comes from the God within you.

Seth watches as Cain leaves in the distance. Seth weeps.
