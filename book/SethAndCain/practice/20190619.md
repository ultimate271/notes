Seth found himself floating over an entire ocean of red.

"Where am I?"

Seth tried to speak aloud, but words didn't come.

Seth looked around. Towards the distance, he could see where the ocean of red
met the blackness to form a horizon.

Seth looked in to the ocean. In the center, directly under him, he saw his
mother. She was bleeding.

"The ocean of blood is my Mother!"

Seth attempted to float down towards her, but he couldn't move. He attempted to
reach towards her, but the distance between them was so vast. There was no way
he was going to navigate himself all the way into the depths blood.

"I have to save her."

Seth was reasoning about the ways he might save his mother when a firm harsh
grip grabbed him by the torso and ripped his soul from this universe that he
had found himself in.

Seth awoke to the vision of his Father looking over him. Seth felt a punch to
the ribs again.

"Do NOT speak back to your mother like that EVER again." With each emphasis,
Adam jabbed Seth in the ribs aggressively. The rhythm of the punches matched
the cadence of Adam's speech.

Finally, Eve stood up and said, "ADAM! This is exactly what happened before!
Stop!"

Adam dropped Seth to the ground, and looked down on him.

Seth wasn't sure what had happened before. This was the first time his father
had acted in this way. Still, he was glad that his mother was able to save him
from his fathers wrath.
