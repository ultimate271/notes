So I want to talk about the Adam and Eve story again, because that story has
two parts. I have mostly told the version from Adam's point of view, but I have
not yet told the story from Eve's point of view. This is the story from Eve's
point of view.

In her world, she was born. She, like other primates of her time, grew up with
other children, and other primates. However, when she was a young child, before
she could form memories or create meaningful social bonds, her group of
primates was raided by hyenas. In the chaos, a man, another one of the
primates, saw this girl lying on the ground, and picked her up. He fled of with
her.

He took her to a place that he thought was a garden. It seemed like an
abandoned garden from some sort of ancient civilization. She was still young,
at the time, and began crying, because she needed food. When they made it to
the center of the farm, she ran away from adam, and began eating the mushrooms.
Before Adam could stop her, she had eaten them.

She handed some to him.

This is a ridiculous story.
