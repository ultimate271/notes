# 001 Adam and Eve (Adam)
After reading this, I am actually quite surprised with how similar I made this
version to Eve's. I think all this means is that Eve's version is corraborated
strongly with Adam's.

This material should not go in the finished product.

#002 Seth and Cain (Early)
So after reading this, the redeeming quality in this work is that Cain has a
much more sinister voice in this version. I like it quite a lot actually,
although I don't think it fits where Seth and Cain end up.

#003 Seth and Cain (Early)
So this story is where I start to begin to tell the dialogue from Seth's pov. I
also detail out the story of Cain and Abel as told by Adam. I like this version
a bit because it emphasizes the fear Adam and Eve have of Cain.

This is also the version where I have Cain visit Seth, and threaten him. Again,
I like this more sinister Cain voice, but I don't think it fits in the finished
product.

It also has the strange bear version of the Cain and Abel story, which I don't
like and will certainly cut.

I also have a trippy version of what Cain might have gone through after he
killed Abel. It's... not well written, but it's there.

Also, in this version, the mushrooms are not so well understood. Did they keep
some, does Cain have some, did Abel eat them, did Cain tempt Seth with them?
Nobody knows.

Also, the transistion from Seth being warry of Cain to crying is abrupt and
strange in this version. Again, I like the sinister Cain, but again, I think it
won't work for the end result.

Also, the ending here is an option (with Cain kissing a crying Seth on the
forehead) but I don't think it will work best for what I want to accomplish.
