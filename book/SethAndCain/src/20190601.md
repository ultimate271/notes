![Brett Gerald Webster] (jpg\brettgeraldwebster.jpg)

Brett "Gerald B Orbweaver" Webster is a Dallas born Richardsonite who decided to use his middle name, and the name of a species of spider, as a penname. His motivations for using a penname like this are unclear, even to himself, but he has found that it allows for him to talk about himself in the third person without seeming weird. Gerald would say that Brett is very long winded, and Brett would say that Gerald is a little too contientious. Of course, Brett loves Gerald for that very reason, and likewise Gerald loves Brett for what he is. Both sides of the brain can meet in the middle.

Of course, my full, real name is Brett Gerald Webster, and my pen name is "Gerald B Orbweaver". I chose Gerald as the familiar name of my penname mostly because Gerald is my middle name, but also because my Father's Father, who was resting soundly in the grave for ten years before I was born, was also named Gerald, which is of course where my parents got the idea.

Likewise, I chose the last name of Orbweaver mostly because I like that particular species of spider. Of course, there were additional reasons for choosing that name. First and foremost, the syllables of the word "Orbweaver" simply sound aesthetically pleasing, and it flows off the tongue with elegance.  Second, I have reccuring dreams where I spin thread into orb, and then capture that orb inside of glass. The name "Orbweaver" seems like the best description of that process.

I will close with the final remark that, as much as my psyche is split in two, Gerald is the author, and Brett is the artist. Fortunately, my psyche is not split in two anymore, so Brett and Gerald can integrate with eachother to form "Brett Gerald", which is incidentally what my Mother used to yell towards me when I was in serious trouble.  I don't know if I have a third man inside of me named Webster; I suspect no, but only time will reveal if another sort of man reveals himself to me.

Peace and Love,
