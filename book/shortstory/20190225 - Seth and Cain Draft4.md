Below is the dialogue of Seth and Cain.

Many people know the story of Cain and Abel. That story has been told through
the centuries as the story about a man that killed his brother. However, there
is a lesser known dialogue that took place between the brothers Seth and Cain.
The brothers never contacted eachother but for this one encounter. The result
of this encounter, though, was not a murder, but instead, a mutual
understanding.  Because of this, this story does not get as much attention as
the Cain and Abel story, but without the Seth and Cain story, the keystone of
understanding this period in mythological folklore is lost. The discussion that
these two brothers had on that day is filled with subtlty and nuance that is
essential to understanding the beginnings of our psychological lives.

It is difficult to know exactly what words were said in the cabin between these
two men. In fact, since the only other humans alive at the time of the
conversation were Adam and Eve, and because neither party kept a transcript of
the words that were spoken, it is nearly impossible to know exactly what was
said. However, we will not let this obstacle deter us, and we will use our
mind's eye as best we are able to analyze the spirit of what was said that day.
Even if we are not able to recreate in exact Hebrew the exact utterances of
each human in the room, we will still be able to approximate a conversation
which says effectively the same thing as the actual words that were spoken.
Since this is not history, that should be enough.

Our story begins with the birth of a child, a child named Seth. As Seth is
learning about the world, he learns that his parents were the first ever humans
to exist on the world, and that he is their only child. His mom told him that
the farm, and all of the crops that it grows, will be his when he grows of age.
It is his responsibility to take up the lineage of the humans.

So of course, Seth learned about farming, and protecting the farm. His mother
would teach him about planting seeds and nurturing crops, and his father would
teach him how to till the soil, and handle the machinary. Seth learned about
the different seasons, about ideal rainfall, and about crop rotation as some of
the most fundamental things in his developmental upbringing. Tending to and
protecting the farm is the number one priority of the entire way of life to
Seth and his parents.
