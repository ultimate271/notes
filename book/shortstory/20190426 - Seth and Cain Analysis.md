So I want to take a quick moment right here to talk a bit about Seth and Cain.

Firstly, I want to briefly remind myself of the overall structure of the work.

It is divided in to six sections. Each section represents a sort of
meso-transformation for Seth. The beginning of the novel has Seth as an infant,
and we learn to understand Seth's life.

The first part and second part are primarily to set the building blocks for the
rest of the story. Essentially, the whole point is that Seth comes to the
realization that the stories told by his parents might not be true in the way
he thinks they are, and he has to discover for himself what concepts like
Yahweh, God, and Divine Spirit mean to him for himself, and that there is no
simple answer like he would like there to be.

So the third part has Seth as a teenager going on a pilgramage and meeting a
stranger there. It's in this interaction that we actually see glimpses of the
transformed relationship.

The fourth part begins with Seth psychologically projecting some kind of demon
on to Cain, and has Cain goes through the Cain and Abel story, we see Seth
start to strip away that demon.

The fifth part should detail Cain's exile. I like having a dialog between Cain
and the Devil take place here, but it's not neccesary.

The sixth part should go through Cain's version of the Garden of Eden. It's at
this point that Seth begins to realize he doesn't know what is true and what
isn't true. I want Seth to begin to have some sort of psychosis here, and
though I'm not sure quite yet how that psychosis will manifest, I want Cain to
work him through the psychosis, and lead him out the other side.

The epilogue will then return to the author's perspective, detailing things
about continuity.

So let's look at the building blocks that Harmon used when talking about the
hero's journey, and see how well that applies to our story here.

. You (a character is in a zone of comfort)
. Need (but they want something)
. Go (they enter an unfamiliar situation)
. Search (adapt to it)
. Find (find what they wanted)
. Take (pay its price)
. Return (and go back to where they started)
. Change (now capable of change)

So, I think something I want to say, and the reason that I think this novella
should be composed of six seperate sections, is because I think each section
should represent something of this hero's journey.

Let's take part one, Eve's retelling of the Garden of Eden.

. Eve, originating in a zone of unfiltered love and warmth, finds herself next to
her lover, Adam, and is told by Yahweh that she and he are the first humans
ever to exist. They are also told not to eat of the mushrooms of knowledge.
. Eve and Adam both want to explore this world that Yahweh has created
. Eve and Adam enter into the garden.
. They adapt to it, and continue to name the bests.
. One day, Eve finds a talking snake in the garden. The Snake convinces her to
eat of the mushrooms.
. Eve takes the mushrooms to Adam for him to eat, but he gives her the terrible
news that she has been duped. Adam decides to help bear the burden that Eve
cannot bear alone.
. Yahweh sends an angel to escort Adam and Eve out of the garden.
. The angel gives them the prophecy of the Son of God, and Adam and Eve go forth
into the world.

So with all of that, part one very easily fits into Harmon's mold.

Part 2, Adam's retelling Cain and Abel.

. Cain, a character in a zone of comfort, is raised by his mother.
. However, he is not satisfied, and needs to find something.
. Cain goes on a pilgramage
. (This pilgramage is it's own hero's journey, and is expanded upon in part 6)
It ends with Cain finding the mushrooms and return to his parents home.
. Cain, having believed he found the object of his desire, returns home to find
that his parents are no longer particularly interested in his findings, and are
instead more concerned with Abel.
. Cain attempts to integrate what he found in the mushrooms in to his returned
life, but he can't. Abel does not allow it. Also, Cain grows envious and
jealous of Abel. This culimanates in the climax of Cain killing his brother
Abel.
. Cain returns to his parents to tell them the sour news. His parents disown
him as a son, and exile Cain from their farms.
. Cain goes in to exile, now an entirely changed man. According to Adam, Cain
has been wholly possessed by the devil, and short of exocism is entirely a
different sort of being to work with.

So I think already, I am starting to see where my analysis is looping in on
itself. Let's continue with Part 3, because that one could be interesting.

. Seth, a character having been molded by the upbringing of the past two
sections, is in a zone of comfort.
. However, he is not satisfied, and wants to see more of the world for himself.
. With the blessing of his parents, Seth goes on a pilgramage.
. On the pilgramage, Seth wanders, and discovers that there is actually very
little of interest in the immediate vicinity. Eventually, he passes a threshold
in to a new kind of habitat, a swamp.
. After exploring the swamp for some time, a stranger finds Seth.
. They agree to be friends, and the stranger takes Seth to his cottage.
. After annoiting Seth, Seth discovers that this stranger is his brother Cain.
. Seth, now in the cottage with his brother, is able to get to a place of
relative comfort with his brother after some dialogue, but requests to hear the
story of Cain and Abel from the mouth of Cain.

Part four is the Cain and Abel story, but this time told by Cain.

. Cain is in a place of comfort
. Cain learns of his love of his mother, and needs to leave.
. Cain goes on a pilgramage. He returns to find Abel in the hands of his
parents. This hero's journey has placed him in a return state that is like a
new threshold for Cain.
. Cain attempts to adapt to his new environment, but his parents are constantly
pushing back against it.
. Cain, after describing what happened at the alter between their family,
finally finds his inner peace.
. For that inner peace, Cain pays the price by holding Abel's dying corpse.
. Cain returns to his father, who accuses him of murder, and sends Cain on
Exile.
. Cain goes in to exile, contemplating the ways that this was a good thing for
him.

Part five will the Cain's exile story. I have written a few versions of this
story, so I will forgoe analyzing it at this moment.

Part six will be Cain's retelling of the Garden of Eden. Again, I have told a
few versions of this story, so I forgoe retelling it.
