#Commentary
So after I have read a bit of my own work, I have decided to do a bit of a line
by line, paragraph by paragraph analysis of it. I have concluded that the
beginning and middle are much too verbose, and a lot of the things I say could
be cut. I think I talk a little bit too much about the king, and what he is
like, and not enough about the people of the king, and I want this to be a more
nebulous sort of piece. I don't want the king, or the people, to be fully
fleshed out characters with descriptions, these things are more abstractions,
so I want that to be reflected in the writing.

    In there land there was a king. As far as kings go, this king was what his
    critics would call "okay", never extraordinary, but still keeping to his
    kingly duties and generally doing with kind heart what was expected of him
    as king. He was a figurehead for a farming town during a time of peace and
    prosperity. The king owned a crown, but he never wore it except to very
    special occasions where it was worn as a decorative piece briefly before it
    is placed to the side.  Things were what any pragmatic observer of the
    situation would call good.

This first paragraph is a good example I think of what plagues the first
section of the novel. I go into to many minute details, and I say things in
much too clever of a way.

    In the land there was a king.

I like opening with this line. I dislike the bit that comes after it though.
The sentence ends with the word king, so I think the first thing the reader
sees should be something about this king, rather then the phrase "as far as
kings go" which is a sort of anchroism.

I want the next line to be a line similar to "The king was neither great nor
bad" but that seems a bit stilted. I am considering the following.

    The king was neither a great king, nor was he an awful king.

I like ending that there. Another idea, which I think I have already dismissed,
is.

    The king was not exceptional in either the positive nor the negative.

But I don't like this because it tries to hard to use "mathy" sorts of words.

    The king was neither an exceptionally great king, nor was he an
    exceptionally bad king.

I could play with that word exceptional, although I don't like that because it
puts in the readers head the concept of "exceptional" in some way, even if the
reader is expecting a contrast to some excetpional quality that will come
later, it will never come, so I think I will avoid that word.

    The king was neither great nor awful; he was merely adequete.

I like this. When I read that in my head, I put a pause after "merely". In
fact, I don't know if that word merely needs to be there. What purpose does it
serve? I think it does need to be there, to show that he was "very much"
adequety. I think that merely fits there. So let's go with that.

    In the land there was a king. This king was neither great, nor was he
    awful; he was merely adequete.

Let's put the full orignal sentence there to see the thought that comes after
this.

    As far as kings go, this king was what his critics would call "okay", never
    extraordinary, but still keeping to his kingly duties and generally doing
    with kind heart what was expected of him as king.

So the next sentence has to say something about how he did what was expected of
him, but he did not do something of note. Something like.

    The king kept to his kingly responisibilities, but he did not do anything
    to set him apart in the line of his fathers.

    He did not do anything to set him apart form his line of fathers

So as I analyze this, I feel as though I need to take a break here. I think,
what would serve me much better, would be to create, as I do with other works
of fiction, a sort of outline from the story. So lets do that.

Okay, so I have done that now, and I have determined a few things. I wish to
write commentary on all of the sections of the work, but I will say that some
of the more inspired writing is in the ritual. I like the fact that it takes up
a good chunk of the work, as it seperates the nihilism of the king, and allows
the reader to focus on the efforts of the people to find some solution to their
problem.

I think the primary problem with it is not in the length, although for sure
there are some sentences that should be cut, but rather in the musicality of
it. I have some rather long paragraphs, and if those paragraphs were
restructured just a little, it would engage the reader quite a bit more in the
ritual, and take them to it, and engulf them in it, rather than merely
"describe" it to them. So I will aim to do that.

Also, the exposition needs a lot of work, which is understandable, because I am
pretty sure I was high when I commited that at first. That is the only section
I was high when I wrote, and indeed, it is the section that needs the most
work. Say what you will about marijuana, but I think it is best used for when I
don't have ideas to write about and I want to be inspired to write a bunch of
crap that I can sift through later. Of course, I won't be smoking any weed for
a while, but that's a whole different topic.

# Introducing the king
Looking at this entire section as a whole, I think the outline needs some
rearranging. I like starting with the king, but I then want to talk about the
prosperity of the people. Then I could talk about the queen, or lack thereof,
and from there talk about the increasing nihilsm and the effect that it had on
teh people
## The king was an average king.
I like the starting line here. I think this paragraph could use a lot less. I
don't need to talk about the crown, or anything like that. Also, I'm not sure
how I feel about the use of the my language, it's cheeky, and I like the
cheekyness, since this is a sort of cheeky work, but I think it's overly so
here.

## In the kings age, he never marries
I feel like I spend way too much time here talking about how this king is
pursuing other interests, when really, I want that to be the point of the king,
that he doesn't have the time to pursue other interests, and in his old age he
becomes more and more bitter at the world. This entire paragraph should be
re-worked I think.

## Ramifications of this decision
I am not so sure how I feel about this decision. I just had the idea that maybe
the king had a queen, but she died rather young and cruely, and the king never
wanted to marry again. This contributes to his bitterness and nihilism.

I could throw in a line like, "I have much to much to do, and a queen would
only add to that." I like that the kings stubbonness is what stops him from
marrying. I also like this, because the people could be trying to force a queen
on the kings, so that there will be an heir. This is what they go to the dragon
for.

## The prosperity of the people under the king
I do like the notion that the king did good things for his people, but I think
I am too specific here. A line like, "All of the things that indicate progress
in times of peace happened". That line needs some work, but that's what needs
to change.

## The peoples opinions of the king
I think there needs to be more transition here. I want something like, "In the
beginning, the people were happy with their king" to give the sort of lead that
they won't be happy later. I also talk about the king too much, I want his
bitterness to be apparent in my descriptions, I am telling too much here.

# The king grows nihilistic
This entire section could be cut quite a bit. I like the two quotes, with
something between them, but there is a lot here that is simple rehashing.
## The state of the king in later years (plus a quote that I sort of like)
THe only thing I would change here is maybe some revisions on the quote, just
to polish it if neccesary, and the words after the quote which don't serve much
purpose. Inebriation is the only time this is mentioned, it's not needed.

## Consequences of the kings choice to not marry
This entire paragraph could be cut to be honest. It feels SJW'ish almost. It's
an "I'm 14 and this is deep" paragraph.

## The king grows contemplative
I like this paragraph, but it could use some work. Past glories goes against
the concept of "this is an average king", so that needs to be changed. That
last sentance is good, but it could be polish and that last phrase could be
cut.

## Contrast to the kings life with a farmers
This could be another quote by the king. It would work better that way.

# The peoples reaction to the kings nihilism
## The people, hopeful that this is a slump, begin to realize that it is more, and cause unrest
I don't like the unrest part, I prefer something like, "the people started to
become uneasy".

## The people inquire of the king
I like these quotes, although again a lot of what is said could be cut. Also,
it's not clear if these are things they say among themselves, or things that
are brought to the king. That distinction should be made, although I am
undecided on which way it should go. It should be some of both. It just needs
to be more clear

## The king replies to the people
This is a re-hashing of the farm-hand line. I like it here better. Also, the
mother's tit I think is an out of place analogy. From my youth would work
better.

## The people's helplessness
Archaic language here needs to be polish, and it's unclear what "so it seemed"
refers to. I also don't like that the people were "taken aback". I would prefer
emphasize the continued efforts of the people met with this nihilism.

## The people talk about mountians in the West where they could summon a beast that might help
I don't think the ritual was taught to them. This should be a thing of legends.
Also, the leaders speech could be polish a bit.

## The inital reluctance to take this route
I like this sentence a lot, it just needs some polish.

# The quest of the people
## A group of them gathers, and they make their way to the mountains
The number of them could be more elegantly stated. Also, I want them to take
many things, showing that they are unsure what they want to bring.

## The march along the way
I like this paragraph, although there is a good amount in it that is
unneccsary. The people turning back for practical reasons I think sohuld be
cut, even though I like that line.

## After making it to their destination, which is peculiar in it's symetry
The way the arrive is to vague. Is this a hallowed and strange place or not? I
would rather start with their coming to other clearings, and not being sure,
but when they come to this one, they know it to be the one. It should be
sudden, rather than an investigation. Similar to the line "when you meet the
one, you will know, and if you don't know it is not the one"

## They consider this clearing in comparison to their others, and determine that this is the correct spot
This paragraph should be combined with the previous. This paragraph should be a
description of the clearing.

## The people begin to clear the brush and set up their ritual
I like the setting up of the ritual. These three last paragraphs should have
more of a symettry about them. First they find clearings, then they find the
one, then they set up their ritual. It needs to be more pointed like that.

## A crecendo of drums and dancing
More active voice should be used. I want to use shorter more impactful
sentences to describe the scene. I like the sentences in the order they are,
but it could use some revision. There are some things I really like, and some
statements that feel like they should be cut.

## The calf is brought to the center and slain
The one among them I have decided is "the leader of the people", and he has
already been introduced. He is a fourth character in this work. Also, I'm not
sure how I feel about the "hallowed knife", I think it should just be his
knife. I want this to be a little more greusome as well. A little more graphic.
I overdo it a bit with the symbolism of the blood and sun as well, that needs
to be polished.

## The people stop their singing, and the calf is set ablaze
I love the sudden stop. That should be it's own sentence for sure. I also like
the description of the eternal moment. The speaking of a chant is very cliche,
I think that part should be cut entirely. The rest just needs polishing.

## The winds rise around this flame
I like the ending of this paragraph, with the townspeople bowing to their
knees. I think I want the chanting to turn into a yell of unison, and for that
yell to become overwhelmed by the winds and the flames. Something like that,
until the winds and flames come to full height, and then the people kneel at
the alter.

## The dragon flies out of the winds and flames
I like none of them seeing where the dragon came from, and I want to use the
description of the dragon appearing to reflect that a little better. Even
though this is an omniscient narrator, he also should only attempt to narrate
what the people saw and heard.

## The people evalute the dragon as the scene dies down
I use the words hallowed too much. Also, I think it's too soon to talk about
the mortality of the dragon. I would much rather this be just a description of
the dragon

# The people discuss their situation with the dragon
## The dragon makes the first inquiry
I like this section, and the next one.
## After the people do not answer, the dragon asks again with more authority
I like this section and the previous one
## The leader of the people there answers the dragon
The leader is the leader, not "the one who leaded them". Also, I feel the
stammering is a little overdone. Or not done enough. I like the stammering, and
the fact that he has a period of not stammering is what is strange. The
stammering should have more effect, rather than me just putting elipses between
a sentence.
