# Jesus born today
I just got the idea that Jesus is born again in todays world, but he has to
discover the teachings of Chirstianity (his own teachings) again. He does not
know or remember that he is Jesus.

This is a very lofty goal, for I am certainly not the scholar required to write
a story like this. But I like this idea. I don't like it at the same time.

I don't like it because it elevates Jesus to a level that I don't want him to
go to. That is, I don't like it because it makes it seems as though the
orthodox view of Christianity is correct, and no matter what reading of this
story you take, this view is what is given. So it needs work.

But still, I like the idea of exploring the ideas of Christianity from the one
who created Chirstianity. Or rather, from the central figure in Chirstianity.
