There is much difference in having the ability to do something and actually
doing it, for there is great benefit in doing that which you know you have the
ability to do, lest you sit on the knowledge of your ability without action and
let it grow stale.

Both Yin and Yang in the absence of the other lead to emptiness.
Rather, the Yin in absence of Yang is empty;
the Yang in absence of Yin is overfull.

Mind as the Yin, Body as the Yang, two halves of one universe,
The existance of a singular human being. Yin always looking
outward while Yang looked inward. Or Yang of workout and yin of recovery.
Two halves to everything in this way. One can be identified Yin,
the other Yang, but always with eachother, these two are, and without
the other, they fall apart to nothing. Or Exhaust themself into everything.
One or the other. Or something entirely different. It doesn't matter.

The relationship between me as a child and you as an adult started 26 years
ago, and has matured into what it is now. The relationship of me as an adult
and you as an old person started 8 months ago. That relationship is still in
its infancy, but it will mature just as well.

For everything is born out of stillness, and to chaos it will go. Do not fight
the chaos, for that is the destiny of all things living and non, but instead
accept it and allow yourself to become one with the stillness so that the chaos
may not find you in your time.

You ask me, sir, the reason for my way of life. But I ask you the same, but I
only in rhetoric, as I know the answer. For I understand that you and I are of
different kin, and as such have a different nature, and while I can appreciate
your doings in this land, my path is not the one presented for me, because
though I see the fruit of it, I desire more a path of suffering and sorrow, as
those things are indeed two of the many paints that I wish to emblazen my
portrait with. And in this way, I implore to you, allow me to go in my ways,
ill though they may seem to you, so that I can find my transcendence in my own
path.

The man that lies and deceives others, that man is an asshole;
The man that lies and deceives himself, that man is a sinner.

She looked up and saw him, that man, the man she knew in her heart to be evil,
sitting there atop the cliff, in perfect stillness, as the sun glowed red
across his figure. She had known it to be true, she had known that he would
meditate on his deeds with great deliberation and foresight before commiting
his atrocities, but she had not seen it, and for a moment she discarded her
memory of him and saw only a man in stillness, a stillness and calm that very
few would ever seek to find, even herself. Her notion of good and evil
vanished, and she saw that man in introspection, in a stillness and calm that
very few would ever seek to find.  Would it not be wrong to destroy such a man,
this man who had found a depth that is only too rare in others and even indeed
in herself? Is not the unmeditated path of salvation simply the easy way, the
way that is accepted and natural for one such as herself. Can the unmeditated
act of kindness ever be called saintly? She couldn't help but wonder, could it
be wrong to destroy that which has depth, even if that depth was evil? In that
moment, as she examined her thoughts, she could not help but feel that she, in
her hurried and constant need to do what she felt was right, had never stopped
to meditate on her own actions.  Could her intentions perhaps be wrong?  And if
she chose to act on her instinct rather than in meditation as he did, did that
not make her in some strange way more evil than he would ever be?
