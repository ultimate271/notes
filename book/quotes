There is much difference in having the ability to do something and actually
doing it, for there is great benefit in doing that which you know you have the

Both Yin and Yang in the absence of the other lead to emptiness.

The relationship between me as a child and you as an adult started 26 years
ago, and has matured into what it is now. The relationship of me as an adult
and you as an old person started 8 months ago. That relationship is still in

For everything is born out of stillness, and to chaos it will go. Do not fight
the chaos, for that is the destiny of all things living and non, but instead

You ask me, sir, the reason for my way of life. But I ask you the same, but I
only in rhetoric, as I know the answer. For I understand that you and I are of
different kin, and as such have a different nature, and while I can appreciate
your doings in this land, my path is not the one presented for me, because
though I see the fruit of it, I desire more a path of suffering and sorrow, as
those things are indeed two of the many paints that I wish to emblazen my
portrait with. And in this way, I implore to you, allow me to go in my ways,
ill though they may seem to you, so that I can find my transcendence in my own
path.
