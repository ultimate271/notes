There is a big difference between having the ability to do something and actually doing it.

Both Yin and Yang in the absence of the other lead to emptiness.

The relationship between me as a child and you as an adult started 26 years ago, and has matured into what it is now. The relationship of me as an adult and you as an old person started 8 months ago. That relationship is still in its infancy, but it will mature just as well.

For everything is born out of stillness, and to chaos it will go. Do not fight the chaos, for that is the destiny of all things living and non, but instead accept it and allow yourself to become one with the stillness so that the chaos may not find you in your time.
