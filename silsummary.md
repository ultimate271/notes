# Summary of the Silmarillion

## Preface to the summary
So this is my version of the Silmarillion that is not 400 pages long, for
although Tolkien did indeed write the silmarillion in dense form, 400 pages is
still quite a lot of work, especially considering most novella's can tell great
stories in sometimes 80 pages or less.

So what is it about the Sil that makes it so long? We can't jam pack the
density of writing any more, Tolkien did that for us, but what we can do is
leave out the unneccasary bits about how Ered-dalum-gorthoriath, was renamed
to Arktalabum, or whatever, and just go over the gist of the story.

Also, if you're the kind of asshole that thinks spoilers exist, then stop
reading here.

So let's begin by saying, our attempt at an abbreviated version is going to
be a bit in the format of an outline, something of the sort that would be a
standard paper to turn in to a middle school teacher for grading, but
instead of making it purely informational, I intend to put some meat and
flavor of mild personality put into it, part humor, part serious, but mostly
just in good natured fun (because what needs to be mocked more than a work
so serious as the Sil?)

Without further ado

## Summary of the structure of the Sil
The Sil begins with a work called the Ainulindale, which, in elf speak means
something which I'm not going to look up right now, and will not be doing
for any elvish like words. As far as I'm concerned, names like Finwë, Elwë,
Fëanor, Sauron, Olorín, Melian, Manwë, Ulmo, Mandos, Melkor, Baramir, Hurin,
Turin, and etc. all these names only mean something if you give a shit about
Tolkien's invented elvish language. In fact, Tolkien was such a nerd about
these things, he developed the Silmarilion to describe the history of the
elves which led to the philological development of his fantasy language.
What I'm getting at, not only was Tolkien's language entirely fictical, it
was also given a backstory, and an evolution, so that someone speaking this
fictical language could choose from archaic modes, mixed modes, runic modes,
and other iterations along the spectum, and as such have a wide range of
capability to say shit that no one will understand anyway and will label you as
a dork of substansially high level.

Also, at that same token, if you have elvish tatooed on your body, please don't
reproduce, for the safety of everyone involved.  Thank you.

Regardless, back to the Sil, there are 5 "discovered works", each being a
document from Gondorian Librarian Banks found in the Fourth Age, that
describe the events as documented by elvish scholars of old. And from these
works, 5 that have survived through the fourth, fifth, and sixth ages to the
present day are labeled as thus: Ainulindale, Valaquenta, Quenta
Silmarillion, Akallabêth, Of the Rings of Power.

The bulkiest one is the Quenta Silmarillion, which translates to english as
"The History of the Silmarils", which still begs the question, what is a
Silmaril? Well, it turns out, we don't know that yet, and we'll have to dive
into the mythology to discover it for ourselves, because we start with a
description of a being known as Eru, or Ilúvatar, in the Ainulindale.

## Ainulindale
So Eru is like the thing that is before things that are actually are. He's
different than God, because this shit ain't Christianity and shouldn't be
confused as such, but Eru is to Tolkien's fantasy as God is the the
Christian fantasy. And no, I don't want to get into an argument about
Christianity being real or not, I honestly don't care if it is or isn't and
that argument isn't worth anyone's time.

Continuing, when Eru was the only thing that existed, and the rest of the
world was a void, he began to sing. And out of his song, different voices
were created, and the world being only a void, these voices became almost
sentient things, like Eru in some fashion, but only part of him, so that
when they would harmonize with eachother, together they would find
themselves in unison with Eru. Basically, in lay terms, a bunch of spirits
from the beginning of time start singing and making music.

And these spirits continue to make their song, and Melkor springs as the
most prominant voice. And in his lust and greed, and want to make things
original, outside of the will of Eru, Melkor would create discord for the sake
of blaspheming Eru. Basically, the evil that Melkor is is rooted in his
sense of death and destruction and discord and chaos in the earliest of days
of his music. And the Ainulindale is where that is described.

We also talk about some of the other Ainúr (that is what these sings spirits
are called) notably Manwë, Ulmo, and Aulë.

In short, Manwë is the god of the wind, and the Zeus of this mythology.
Which make make Eru like Chronos or Saturn or whatever other creation being.
Manwë is the god of wind, Ulmo is the god of Waters, and Aulë is the god of
the Earth.

After all this, the Ainulindale goes through a couple phases. First we talk
about just the Music of Ilúvatar, which goes through a few crecendos and
back and forths with Melkor, before Eru creates a vision. This vision goes
through a few ages of the world (I think three), before Eä is created. After
the vision, the Ainúr see that only now do they see the world that is, and
those Ainúr that chose to dwell in the realm of Eä are known as the Valar.

In the conclusion of the Ainulindale, we talk about the coming of the
Children of Ilúvatar, being the Elves and the Men.

## The Valaquenta
In the Valaquenta, we mostly get a catalog of the most prominant Valar, and
Maiar (beings like Gandalf or Saruman or Radagast or Melian that were
accompanying tunes to the Valar in the time of the Music), that take part in
the music. The easiest way to tackle this chapter is just to list them.

    Manwë, of the Winds
    Varda, of the Stars
    Ulmo, of the Seas
    Aulë, of the Earth's core
    Yavanna, of the Earth's surface
    Lórien, forest of healing
    Mandos, halls of the dead
    Nienna, who mourns at Lórien and Mandos
    Oromë, of War
    Tulkas, the Strong

Next we talk about "The enemies" being

    Melkor
    Gorthaur, the Cruel, Maia of Aulë but turned at first toward the will of Melkor

[Spoilers, Gorthaur is Sauron. You know, the eye spirit thing from the Lord
of the Rings. Yeah, that Sauron.]

Lastly we talk about the Maiar, being mostly irrelevent, except two
mentioned here, Olorín and Melian. Olorín is Gandalf, but doesn't do much in
the first and second age but silently guide elves as he may, but Melian
becomes super important in the First Age, as her union with an Elf later is
the only joining of an elf with a Maia ever in the history of existance.

But that's for later, and speaking of later, we move on to...

## The Quenta Silmarillion

So the Quenta Silmarillion is a 24 chapter work that tells of the major
events of the First age, from the First War on Arda before the elves or men
were come to the world to the War of Wrath and the end of the First age.

I'm going to just spoil it now and say this. The basic outline of this
section is thus...

The elves are born and taken to the holy land of Aman, where those called the
Noldor do terrible things, are exiled, and make realm in Middle Earth.  The
build up some kingdoms, but in 5 battles of middle earth, as well as the
workings of what will be called the Oath of Fëanor and the Doom of Mandos,
Melkor basically takes over everything, forcing the Valar to take action
against him in the War of Wrath, marking the end of the First Age.

Obviously, there is going to be more than that going on, but that summary is
like summing up the Lord of the Rings by saying Frodo takes an evil magic ring
to Mount Doom where he destroys it. It gets the idea across, but beauty is lost
in the simplicity.

### First Half
    First, The Valar fight of Melkor and prepare middle earth for the coming of
    elves.

    Next, The elves are born, and the Valar lead them west, to Aman, where the
    Valar dwell, also called Valinor.

    Before that, though, Aulë made the dwarves and Yavanna made the ents, and
    Manwë creates the eagles. Yeah fan service.

    Ulmo creates a pretty sick Island Ferry, and a lot of elves transfer
    across. Those that don't are known as the Sindar.

    The elves come across, and the all those that lay sight on Valinor are
    known as the Eldar

    There are three variety of Eldar. The Eldar we talk about primarily in this
    work are the Noldor, the exiled. The other ones are the Vanyar, that stayed
    in Aman, and the Teleri, who were sailers.

    So of the Noldor, the father of fathers is Finwë. Finwë has a son Fëanor,
    but Fëanors mom dies, so Finwë remarries and has Fingolfin and Finarfin.
    These three half-brothers and their children are the primary focus of the
    rest of the work.

    So all of the light in Arda in that time came from the two trees of
    Valinor, and Fëanor was so skilled that he captured some of that light and
    stored it in the three Silmarils

    Next, Melkor comes and fucks up the lights with this spider bitch named
    Ungoliant. Where does Ungoliant come from? We don't really know, and prefer
    it that way. Melkor also killed Finwë and stole the Silmarils

    Also, it turns out Fëanor is super stubborn, and when he learns that Melkor
    stole his silmarils, he gets pissed. Melkor craftily corrupted Fëanor as
    well, and Fëanor did some questionable shit in that time, like killing a
    bunch of Teleri, stealing their boats, and burning them after sailing out
    of Valinor, all to fight Melkor, who they have renamed to Morgoth.

    Also, Fingolfin and his sons and nephews, and niece Galadriel, go up the
    North Pole and back, cause that shit was still connected in those days, and
    the weather ice and sleet and all that awful shit, but they make it.

    Needless to say, the Valar were none to pleased with the actions of the
    elves, so they declare the Doom of Mandos on the Oath of Fëanor, saying
    that Fëanor's oath to retrieve the Silmarils will lead to nothing but
    destruction.

    In a nutshell, the God of Death and the Keeper of the Gates of the
    Afterlife just put a voodoo curse on the Exiled Noldor, and since voodoo
    curses are real in this work, it turns out that those exiled Noldor didn't
    have things so well off when they got back to Middle Earth.

    So yeah, at this point Fëanor defeats all of Melkor's armies, but being
    ever wrathful comes to Melkor himself, where he blindly kills himself in
    his rage as Melkor destroys him easily.

    Since Fëanor was leader of the Noldor, the right of leader should go to the
    Son, named something like Maedhros? (I don't remember and it doesn't
    matter) but the son is hung at Melkors Tower Thangorodrim (think Melkor's
    version of Barad-dûr) and Fingolfin saves him, and Maedhros decides to give
    up the title of king to Fingolfin because he deserves it I guess.

### Halfway point
    Now we're at about the halfway point, and we have to step back and look at
    how things go. The second half is concerned with the rise of the elves in
    that time, as well as the intermixing of men into the whole equation, and
    then the battles and events that take place, which undo all the rising we
    do at first one by one, leading eventually to the War of Wrath and the
    flooding of Beleriand.

    So there are a few major things I would like to list in table form here.

        Kingdom                 | Capital      | Elf Leader                        | Human Leader
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Angband                 | Thangorodrim | Morgoth (Actually a Valar)        | Sauron (Actually a Maia)
        Hithlum                 | Mithlum      | Fingolfin (Later Fingon)          | House of Galdor (Huor and Hurin)
        Doriath                 | Menegroth    | Elu Thingol with Melian           | House of Halath (whose peoples are insignificant for the most part)
        Dor-lomin -> Dorthonian | Gondolin     | Turgon (son of Fingolfin)         | Bëor and the house of Barahir, incunding Beren, as well as the wives Morwen and Rian of Hurin and Huor
        Sirion                  | Minas Tirith | Orodreth (Son of Finarfin)        | -
        Nargothrond             | Nargothrond  | Finrod Felegund (son of Finarfin) | -
        Thar Gelian             | -            | Sons of Fëanor                    | -

    These are the major abstract characters here, and most of the chaprters
    after the fourth battle involve the doings of these major players

    Also, pretty much every major event from here on involves the elimination
    of one of the things in this list.

### Rise of the elves into kingdoms
    So with that out of the way, lets go over a bit the forming of Beleriand.

    First we talk about the foundation of Hithlum, where Fingolfin takes the
    position of head of all the Noldor. It was closest to the end of their ice
    march, so they settled there.

    Next, we talk about Doriath, where Thingol and Melian had already built
    Menegroth as fortress and sanctioned that with her magic powers none can
    penetrate the Girdle of Melian as it is called. Lüthien is also born of
    them.

    Shortly after, the son of Finarfin (Finarfin, by the way, stayed in
    Valinor, is not one of the exiled, and doesn't appear again until the war
    of wrath), Finrod Felegund, goes to the California of that place and
    creates Nargothrond.

    Fingolfin's two sons, Fingon and Turgon, take two different paths. Fingon
    stays with Fingolfin to become his heir, and Turgon goes to the Montana of
    Beleriand in Dor-lomin through mountain pass to Dorthonian and makes
    Gondolin in the mountains, secret from everyone.

    Orodreth, another son of Finarfin, put a watch on the river Sirion, as the
    landscape funnels from Angband to Nargothrond about the Sirion, so Minas
    Tirith was built there as Tower of the Watch. (This is a different Minas
    Tirith than the one in the Lord of the Rings).

    The other two sons of Finarfin, I forget their names, dwell in Dorthonion,
    but are unaware of Gondolin.

    Lastly, there's the blue mountains, (which mark the eastern region of
    Beleriand but the western coastline of the Lord of the Rings, not to be
    confused with the Misty Mountains, which are even further east), in the New
    York of Beleriand where the sons of Fëanor mostly dwell, as well as the
    Green-elves of Ossirand, in the Florida.

    So yeah, the key points are, Fingolfin is the leader of the Noldor in
    Hithlum, his Nephew Finrod is Leader of Nargothrond, His other nephew
    Orodreth is in charge of Minas Tirith, and two other nephews are
    accountable for Dorthonion (the area around Gondolin). Fingolfin's son
    Fingon is his heir and Turgon is leader of Gondolin. Then there is the sons
    of Fëanor in the Northeast about the river Gelion. Lastly of the sindar we
    have Elu Thingol and Melian inside Menegroth of the Forest of Doriath.

    That was just a name dump, but those are the biggest abstract entities that
    act almost as characters in this work.

    Oh, and of course, there is Angband in the North, with Thangorodrim as the
    towers there, with Morgoth as the leader, and Sauron as his most trusted
    companion.

    And of men, there is Bëor the old, who has Thingols blessing and goes north
    to Dorthonian, and Bëor's people just dwell in the other parts of
    Dorthonian besides Gondolin because they don't know Gondolin exists.

    Malach's people go to Hithlum and lead the men with Fingolfin (Fingon
    later), Galdor father of Hurin and Huor (who see Gondolin, but return to
    Hithlum) is of this house.

    Lastly, there is some chick named something like Haleth, who dwells in
    Western Doriath, but she doesn't matter much

    I am trying my best to only give the names that really matter, because a
    lot of them don't but most of these that I give I feel are very important
    to at least keep in your head if you were to attempt to read the Sil as the
    most important ones, or at least the ones to recognize.

### Fall of each of those kingdoms one by one
    These unions of men and elves turn out to be pretty strong, and twice
    Morgoth attacks and twice we do well, fending off most of the stuff pretty
    handily. These are the second and third battles in middle earth (the first
    being the one where Fëanor died).

    Next, we have a story about how, in Gondolin, Turgon's sister leaves
    Gondolin, marries some sketch ass dark elf, they have a kid, come back to
    Gondilin, and tragically both the mom and the father are killed, and Turgon
    takes the kid as his own, his nephew. The kids name is Maeglin, but who
    gives a shit, he barely comes up later.

    And yeah, the fourth battle, where shit starts falling. Morgoth gets the
    upper hand at the start, burns a bunch of shit to ash, kills Fingolfin
    making Fingon ruler of Noldor, and Sauron captures Minas Tirith and
    probably renames it something sinister. Barahir in the ashy forest place in
    the north is given the Ring of Turgon, which isn't like the ring of power,
    but is relevent as a ring that comes to Aragorn in the Lord of the Rings.
    Minas Tirith is ovetaken.

    Next, we talk about the first epic tale of the Silmarillion, the Tale of
    Beren and Luthien. In short, Beren escapes the fourth battle with the Ring
    of Barahir, and by chance comes to Doriath where he sees the half elf half
    Maia Lüthien, daughter of Thingol and Melian, and they fall in love.
    Thingol is of course upset that his daughter should fall in love with a
    man, and requests a Silmaril. With the help of a beast from Valinor, the
    three assail Angband (think Morgoths version of Mordor), and Beren gets a
    Silmaril from Morgoths crown, but a wolf eats his hand. After they kill the
    wolf, Thingol takes the Silmaril, and Luthien chooses mortality so that she
    can be with Beren on middle earth. They go to Ossirand in the southeast and
    have a child (their line eventually leads to Elrond and Elros on the
    Mother's side Elrond's mother being Elwing). This is the last chapter where
    a new kingdom doesn't fall.

    The elves at that time decide they are strong enough to attack Angband, and
    begin the fifth battle. Fingon and Fëanor's sons look to sandwich Angband,
    and Turgon of Gondolin joins in to happy surprise, and their plans almost
    work except humans known as Easterlings betray Fëanors kind and sway the
    battle in favor of Morgoth. Fingon is slain, leaving Hithlum leaderless,
    and it becomes overtaken by the Easterlings. Huor is also slain, and Húrin
    is captured, (Huor and Hurin being also of Hithlum). Hithlum is taken.

    Next is the tale of Túrin, son of Hurin. In short, his mom secretly packs
    him out of Hithlum to Doriath where he is raised, until he eventually lives
    as a leader of savages, accidently kills an elf he loved, and marries his
    sister because he didn't know they were sisters. Then a dragon takes over
    Nargothrond, and Turin eventually kills and is killed by this dragon.
    Nargothrond is overthrown

    Menegroth is the next to fall, this one because of Hurin. Hurin is released
    by Morgoth, having been in captivity for many decades, and goes to
    Nargothrond where he takes a dwarf necklace. He brings the dwarf necklace
    to Thingol in Menegroth, who decides he wants the Silmaril embedded in it.
    As the dwarves are doing that, they kill the king Elu Thingol of Doriath,
    and eventually are overtaken by Beren and Lüthien who come unlooked for
    from Ossiriand, and they recover the Silmaril and Lüthien gives it to her
    son Dior when she dies, who gives it to his daughter Elwing when he dies,
    who takes it to the Bay of Balar in the Southwest. Menegroth of Doriath is
    overthrown

    On the other end of things, Tuor, at the visions of Ulmo, comes to Gondolin
    and gets jiggy with Idril the daughter of Turgon, and they have Eärendil.
    But Morgoth, now knowing the location of Gondolin, takes it over, but Idril
    and Tuor escape with Eärendil and also end up at the Bay of Balar. Gondolin
    is overtaken.

    Eärendil and Elwing meet there and have Elrond and Elros, and at the
    instruction of Círdan, Eärendil makes a boat. The only exiled kingdoms left
    are Fëanor's sons, and they raid Elwing with the Silmaril because the Oath
    of Fëanor and Doom of Mandos is still in them, but she casts herself to the
    sea, and Ulmo brings her to Eärendil, who use the silmaril to guide
    themselves to Valinor, where Eärendil pleas to the Valar, and they grant
    their aid in the War of Wrath, where Morgoth is overthrown, the two
    Silmarils are recovered, and Eärendil and Elwing and their children Elrond
    and Elros and their halfelven decendants are given the choice of Elvish or
    Human Doom. But even with the Silmarils in the hands of the Valar, two
    brothers of Fëanor steal the two from the Valar, and the silmarils burn the
    elves, driving them mad. One casts himself into the depths of the earth in
    one of the chasms of the mountains, and the other casts himself into the
    sea.  And those two, in earth and sea, with Eärendil's in his boat in the
    sky, make up the fate of the Silmarils, marking the end of the first age
    and the end of the Doom of Mandos and the last fate of the Silmarils until
    the Last Battle, of which no tales can tell. Oh, and Beleriand was flooded
    as well.

### Conclusion
So that's the key points of the Sil, I'm sure you could go through and make it
even shorter, or longer, depending on how deep you want to go, but that hits
all the high points while preserving the names of everyone involved.

## Akallabêth
Next is the Akallabêth, where it is told in the second age how the men of
Nûmenor become corrupted by Sauron, forcing the Valar to turn the world into a
sphere, seperating Middle Earth and Valinor forever. A key point here is that
Elendil, with sons Isuldur and another who doesn't matter, save the tree of
Nimloth before Sauron destroys it.

## Rings of Power
Lastly, in Of the Rings of Power, we go over some Numenor stuff again, but now
talking about the middle earth side, where Sauron created rings of power. The
elves take off their rings, and during the Akallabêth, Sauron returns to
Mordor, and Elendil and Gil-galad create Arnor and Gondor, whose reigns lasted
well enough, and fight Sauron, defeating him and marking the end of the second
age. But Isuldur takes the ring, the disaster at Gladden fields where the ring
is lost, Imladris is made as sanctuary, and Elrond Galadriel, Saruman, Gandalf,
and Radagast make up the council of the wise, where they drive out the dark
spirits of Mirkwood, who they realize now is Sauron. Saruman becomes corrupted by
want for the Ring, but it is Gandalf who realizes he has found it by chance.
And at last, it is told how the heir of Isuldur Elessar (who is Aragorn) came
again, and reforged the sword Narsil of Isuldur, and with Mithrindar defeat
Saurman at Orthanc, before going to Minas Tirith to fight at Pelannor and
finally the Black Gate, to fight battle against all hopes. But Frodo the
Halfling, at the bidding of Mithrandir, with his Servant, took the ring to
Orodruin where it was made and threw it into the fire, and Sauron's spirit was
undone, and against all odds, the Children were victorious over Sauron, and
Elessar planted a seedling of Nimloth in the Captial of Gondor leading to the
beginning of the Fourth Age.

## Conclusion
So yeah, we got that out of the way. In all, the Sil is a great read, and
really it should be read just to appreciate the writing style of Tolkien, the
way he uses clauses to describe things in ways that would otherwise yeild
clunkiness but instead flow off of the train of thought like magic and create
lines and paths through events and characters that have a life of their own.

At least, that's my take, hopefully you get your own taste of this work, not to
be tainted by my own presupposition.

In conclusion, I quite enjoyed my experience decoding the Sil so I could put it
in a format like this, and if you are so up to the task, then I implore you to
take a journey of your own through the work so that you can come to appreciate
it for the literature that it is. It's difficult work, but rewarding in a
spiritual kind of way.
