ARGUMENT.—_When Œdipus king of Thebes discovered that he had unknowingly
been the murderer of his father, and had lived in incest with his
mother, he blinded himself. And his two sons, Eteocles and Polyneikes,
wishing to banish the remembrance of these horrors from the eyes of men,
at first kept him in confinement. And he, being wroth with them, prayed
that they might divide their inheritance with the sword. And they, in
fear lest the prayer should be accomplished, agreed to reign in turn,
each for a year, and Eteocles, as the elder of the two, took the first
turn. But when at the end of the year Polyneikes came to ask for the
kingdom, Eteocles refused to give way, and sent him away empty. So
Polyneikes went to Argos and married the daughter of Adrastos the king
of that country, and gathered together a great army under six great
captains, himself going as the seventh, and led it against Thebes. And
so they compassed it about, and at each of the seven gates of the city
was stationed one of the divisions of the army._

_Note._—_The Seven against Thebes_ appears to have been produced B.C.
472, the year after _The Persians_.




                        THE SEVEN AGAINST THEBES


               SCENE.—THEBES _in front of the Acropolis_

           _Enter_ ETEOCLES, _and crowd of_ Theban Citizens.

 _Eteoc._ Ye citizens of Cadmos, it behoves
 That one who standeth at the stern of State
 Guiding the helm, with eyes unclosed in sleep,
 Should speak the things that meet occasion's need.
 For should we prosper, God gets all the praise:
 But if (which God forbid!) disaster falls,
 Eteocles, much blame on one head falling,
 Would find his name the by-word of the State,[73]
 Sung in the slanderous ballads of the town;
 Yes, and with groanings, which may Zeus the Averter,
 True to his name, from us Cadmeians turn!
 But now 'tis meet for all, both him who fails                        10
 Of full-grown age, and him advanced in years,
 Yet boasting still a stalwart strength of frame,
 And each in life's full prime, as it is fit,
 The State to succour and the altars here
 Of these our country's Gods, that never more
 Their votive honours cease,—to help our sons,
 And Earth, our dearest mother and kind nurse;
 For she, when young ye crept her kindly plain,
 Bearing the whole charge of your nourishment,
 Reared you as denizens that bear the shield,
 That ye should trusty prove in this her need.                        20
 And now thus far God turns the scale for us;
 For unto us, beleaguered these long days,
 War doth in most things with God's help speed well,
 But now, as saith the seer, the augur skilled,[74]
 Watching with ear and mind, apart from fire,
 The birds oracular with mind unerring,
 He, lord and master of these prophet-arts,
 Says that the great attack of the Achæans
 This very night is talked of, and their plots
 Devised against the town. But ye, haste all
 Unto the walls and gateways of the forts;                            30
 Rush ye full-armed, and fill the outer space,
 And stand upon the platforms of the towers,
 And at the entrance of the gates abiding
 Be of good cheer, nor fear ye overmuch
 The host of aliens. Well will God work all.
 And I have sent my scouts and watchers forth,
 And trust their errand is no fruitless one.
 I shall not, hearing them, be caught with guile.

                                                     [_Exeunt_ Citizens.

                       _Enter one of the_ Scouts.

 _Mess._ King of Cadmeians, great Eteocles,
 I from the army come with tidings clear,                             40
 And am myself eye-witness of its acts;
 For seven brave warriors, leading armèd bands,
 Cutting a bull's throat o'er a black-rimmed shield,
 And dipping in the bull's blood with their hands,
 Swore before Ares, Enyo,[75] murderous Fear,
 That they would bring destruction on our town,
 And trample under foot the tower of Cadmos,
 Or dying, with their own blood stain our soil;
 And they memorials for their sires at home
 Placed with their hands upon Adrastos' car,[76]                      50
 Weeping, but no wail uttering with their lips,
 For courage iron-hearted breathed out fire
 In manliness unconquered, as when lions
 Flash battle from their eyeballs. And report
 Of these things does not linger on the way.
 I left them casting lots, that each might take,
 As the lot fell, his station at the gate.
 Wherefore do thou our city's chosen ones
 Array with speed at entrance of the gates;
 For near already is the Argive host,
 Marching through clouds of dust, and whitening foam                  60
 Spots all the plain with drops from horses' mouths.
 And thou, as prudent helmsman of the ship,
 Guard thou our fortress ere the blasts of Ares
 Swoop on it wildly; for there comes the roar
 Of the land-wave of armies. And do thou
 Seize for these things the swiftest tide and time;
 And I, in all that comes, will keep my eye
 As faithful sentry; so through speech full clear,
 Thou, knowing all things yonder, shalt be safe.

                                                                [_Exit._

 _Eteoc._ O Zeus and Earth, and all ye guardian Gods!
 Thou Curse and strong Erinnys of my sire!                            70
 Destroy ye not my city root and branch,
 With sore destruction smitten, one whose voice
 Is that of Hellas, nor our hearths and homes;[77]
 Grant that they never hold in yoke of bondage
 Our country free, and town of Cadmos named;
 But be ye our defence. I deem I speak
 Of what concerns us both; for still 'tis true,
 A prosperous city honours well the Gods.      [_Exit._

         _Enter Chorus of_ Theban Maidens _in solemn procession
                             as suppliants_

 _Chor._ I in wild terror utter cries of woe;
 An army leaves its camp and is let loose:
 Hither the vanguard of the horsemen flows,                           80
       And the thick cloud of dust,
       That suddenly is seen,
       Dumb herald, yet full clear,
       Constrains me to believe;
 And smitten with the horses' hoofs, the plain
 Of this my country rings with noise of war;
       It floats and echoes round,
 Like voice of mountain torrent dashing down
       Resistless in its might.
       Ah Gods! Ah Goddesses!
       Ward off the coming woe.
 With battle-shout that rises o'er the walls,
       The host whose shields are white[78]                           90
 Marches in full array against our city.
       Who then, of all the Gods
 Or Goddesses, will come to help and save?
 Say, shall I fall before the shrines of Gods?
       O blessed Ones firm fixed!
 'Tis time to clasp your sacred images.
 Why linger we in wailing overmuch?
 Hear ye, or hear ye not, the din of shields?
       When, if not now, shall we
 Engage in prayer with peplos and with boughs?[79]
 I hear a mighty sound; it is the din                                100
       Not of a single spear.
 O Ares! ancient guardian of our land!
 What wilt thou do? Wilt thou betray thy land?
       O God of golden casque,
 Look on our city, yea, with favour look,
       The city thou did'st love.
 And ye, ye Gods who o'er the city rule,
       Come all of you, come all.
 Behold the band of maidens suppliant,
       In fear of bondage foul;
       For now around the town
 The wave of warriors bearing slopèd crests,
 With blasts of Ares rushing, hoarsely sounds:                       110
 But thou, O Zeus! true father of us all,
 Ward off, ward off our capture by the foe.


                               STROPHE I

 For Argives now surround the town of Cadmos,
 And dread of Ares' weapons falls on us;
       And, bound to horses' mouths,
 The bits and curbs ring music as of death;
 And seven chief rulers of the mighty host,
 With warriors' arms, at each of seven tall gates,
       Spear-armed and harnessed all,
       Stand, having cast their lots.
        ·       ·       ·       ·       ·


                                 MESODE

 And thou, O Zeus-born power in war delighting,                      120
 O Pallas! be our city's saviour now;
       And Thou who curb'st the steed,
       Great King of Ocean's waves,
 Poseidon, with thy trident fish-spear armed,[80]
 Give respite from our troubles, respite give!
 And Thou, O Ares, guard the town that takes
       Its name from Cadmos old,[81]
       Watch o'er it visibly.


                             ANTISTROPHE I

 And thou, O Kypris, of our race the mother,
 Ward off these ills, for we are thine by blood:
       To thee in many a prayer,                                     130
 With voice that calls upon the Gods we cry,
 And unto thee draw near as suppliants:
 And Thou, Lykeian king, Lykeian be,[82]
       Foe of our hated foes,
       For this our wailing cry;
 And Thou, O child of Leto, Artemis,
       Make ready now thy bow.


                               STROPHE II

 Ah! ah! I hear a din of chariot wheels
       Around the city walls;
       O Hera great and dread!
 The heavy axles of the chariots groan,                              140
       O Artemis beloved!
 And the air maddens with the clash of spears;
       What must our city bear?
       What now shall come on us?
       When will God give the end?


                             ANTISTROPHE II

 Ah! ah! a voice of stones is falling fast
       On battlements attacked;[83]
       O Lord, Apollo loved,
 A din of bronze-bound shields is in the gates;
       And oh! that Zeus may give                                    150
 A faultless issue of this war we wage!
       And Thou, O blessed queen,
       As Guardian Onca known,[84]
       Save thy seven-gated seat.


                              STROPHE III

 And ye, all-working Gods,
 Of either sex divine,
 Protectors of our towers,
 Give not our city, captured by the spear,
 To host of alien speech.[85]
 Hear ye our maidens; hear,                                          160
 As is most meet, our prayers with outstretched hands.


                            ANTISTROPHE III

 O all ye loving Powers,
 Compass our State to save;
 Show how that State ye love;
 Think on our public votive offerings,
 And as ye think, oh, help:
 Be mindful ye, I pray,
 Of all our city's rites of sacrifice.

                          _Re-enter_ ETEOCLES

 _Eteoc._ (_to the Chorus_) I ask you, O ye brood intolerable,
 Is this course best and safest for our city?                        170
 Will it give heart to our beleaguered host,
 That ye before the forms of guardian Gods
 Should wail and howl, ye loathèd of the wise;[86]
 Ne'er be it mine, in ill estate or good,
 To dwell together with the race of women;
 For when they rule, their daring bars approach,
 And when they fear, alike to house and State
 Comes greater ill; and now with these your rushings
 Hither and thither, ye have troubled sore
 Our subjects with a coward want of heart;
 And do your best for those our foes without;                        180
 And we are harassed by ourselves within.
 This comes to one who dwells with womankind.
 And if there be that will not own my sway,
 Or man or woman in their prime, or those
 Who can be classed with neither, they shall take
 Their trial for their life, nor shall they 'scape
 The fate of stoning. Things outdoors are still
 The man's to look to: let not woman counsel.
 Stay thou within, and do no mischief more.
 Hear'st thou, or no? or speak I to the deaf?


                               STROPHE I

 _Chor._ Dear son of Œdipus,                                  190
 I shuddered as I heard the din, the din
         Of many a chariot's noise,
 When on the axles creaked the whirling wheels,
         *And when I heard the sound
 *Of fire-wrought curbs within the horses' mouths.

 _Eteoc._ What then? Did ever yet the sailor flee
 From stern to stem, and find deliverance so,
 While his ship laboured in the ocean's wave?[87]


                             ANTISTROPHE I

 _Chor._ Nay, to the ancient forms
 Of mighty Powers I rushed, as trusting Gods;
         And when behind the gates
 Was heard the crash of fierce and pelting storm,                    200
         Then was it, in my fear,
 I prayed the Blessed Ones to guard our city.

 _Eteoc._ Pray that our towns hold out 'gainst spear of foes.[88]

 _Chor._ Do not the Gods grant these things?

 _Eteoc._                         Nay the Gods,
 So say they, leave the captured city's walls.[89]


                               STROPHE II

 _Chor._ Ah! never in my life
 May all this goodly company of Gods
         Depart; nor may I see
 This city scene of rushings to and fro,                             210
 *And hostile army burning it with fire!

 _Eteoc._ Nay, call not on the Gods with counsel base;
 Obedience is the mother of success,
 Child strong to save. 'Tis thus the saying runs.


                             ANTISTROPHE II

 _Chor._ True is it; but the Gods
 Have yet a mightier power, and oftentimes,
 In pressure of sore ill,
 It raises one perplexed from direst woe,
 When dark clouds gather thickly o'er his eyes.

 _Eteoc._ 'Tis work of men to offer sacrifice
 And victims to the Gods, when foes press hard;                      220
 Thine to be dumb and keep within the house.


                              STROPHE III

 _Chor._ 'Tis through the Gods we live
 In city unsubdued, and that our towers
 Ward off the multitude of jealous foes.
 What Power will grudge us this?

 _Eteoc._ I grudge not your devotion to the Gods;
 But lest you make my citizens faint-hearted
 Be tranquil, nor to fear's excess give way.


                            ANTISTROPHE III

 _Chor._ Hearing but now a din
 Strange, wildly mingled, I with shrinking fear
 Here to our city's high Acropolis,
 Time-hallowed spot, have come.                                      230

 _Eteoc._ Nay, if ye hear of wounded men or dying,
 Bear them not swiftly off with wailing loud;
 *For blood of men is Ares' chosen food.[90]

 _Chor._ Hark! now I hear the panting of the steeds.

 _Eteoc._ Clear though thou hear, yet hear not overmuch.

 _Chor._ Lo! from its depths the fortress groans, beleaguered.

 _Eteoc._ It is enough that I provide for this.

 _Chor._ I fear: the din increases at the gates.

 _Eteoc._ Be still, say nought of these things in the city.

 _Chor._ O holy Band![91] desert ye not our towers.           240

 _Eteoc._ A curse fall on thee! wilt thou not be still?

 _Chor._ Gods of my city, from the slave's lot save me!

 _Eteoc._ 'Tis thou enslav'st thyself and all thy city.

 _Chor._ Oh, turn thy darts, great Zeus, against our foes!

 _Eteoc._ Oh, Zeus, what race of women thou hast given us!

 _Chor._ A sorry race, like men whose city falls.

 _Eteoc._ What? Cling to these statues, yet speak words of ill?

 _Chor._ Fear hurries on my tongue in want of courage.

 _Eteoc._ Could'st thou but grant one small boon at my prayer!250

 _Chor._ Speak it out quickly, and I soon shall know.

 _Eteoc._ Be still, poor fool, and frighten not thy friends.

 _Chor._ Still am I, and with others bear our fate.

 _Eteoc._ These words of thine I much prefer to those:
 And further, though no longer at the shrines,
 Pray thou for victory, that the Gods fight with us.
 And when my prayers thou hearest, then do thou
 Raise a loud, welcome, holy pæan-shout,
 The Hellenes' wonted cry at sacrifice;
 So cheer thy friends, and check their fear of foes;
 And I unto our country's guardian Gods,                             260
 Who hold the plain or watch the agora,
 The springs of Dirkè, and Ismenos' stream;—
 If things go well, and this our city's saved,—
 I vow that staining with the blood of sheep
 The altar-hearths of Gods, or slaying bulls,
 We'll fix our trophies, and our foemen's robes
 On the spear's point on consecrated walls,
 Before the shrines I'll hang.[92] Pray thou this prayer,
 Not weakly wailing, nor with vain wild sobs,
 For no whit more thou'lt 'scape thy destined lot:                   270
 And I six warriors, with myself as seventh,
 Against our foes in full state like their own,
 Will station at the seven gates' entrances,
 Ere hurrying heralds and swift-rushing words
 Come and inflame them in the stress of need.      [_Exit_


                               STROPHE I

 _Chor._ My heart is full of care and knows not sleep,
       By panic fear o'ercome;
       And troubles throng my soul,
       And set a-glow my dread
 Of the great host encamped around our walls,
       As when a trembling dove
       Fears, for her callow brood,                                  280
 The snakes that come, ill mates for her soft nest;
       For some upon our towers
 March in full strength of mingled multitude;
       And what will me befall?
 And others on our men on either hand
       Hurl rugged blocks of stone.
 In every way, ye Zeus-born Gods, defend                             290
       The city and the host
       That Cadmos claim as sire.


                             ANTISTROPHE I

 What better land will ye receive for this,
         If ye to foes resign
         This rich and fertile clime,
         And that Dirkæan stream,
 Goodliest of founts by great Poseidon sent,
         Who circleth earth, or those
         Who Tethys parent call?[93]                                 300
 And therefore, O ye Gods that guard our city,
         Sending on those without
 Our towers a woe that robs men of their life,
         And makes them lose their shield,
 Gain glory for these countrymen of mine;
         And take your standing-ground,
 As saviours of the city, firm and true,
         In answer to our cry
         Of wailing and of prayer.


                               STROPHE II

 For sad it were to hurl to Hades dark
         A city of old fame,                                         310
         The spoil and prey of war,
 With foulest shame in dust and ashes laid,
 By an Achæan foe at God's decree;
 And that our women, old and young alike,
         Be dragged away, ah me!
         Like horses, by their hair
         Their robes torn off from them.
 And lo, the city wails, made desolate,
         While with confusèd cry                                     320
 The wretched prisoners meet doom worse than death.
         Ah, at this grievous fate
         I shudder ere it comes.


                             ANTISTROPHE II

 And piteous 'tis for those whose youth is fresh
         Before the rites that cull
         Their fair and first-ripe fruit,
 To take a hateful journey from their homes.
 Nay, but I say the dead far better fare
 Than these, for when a city is subdued
         It bears full many an ill.
         This man takes prisoner that,                               330
         Or slays, or burns with fire;
 And all the city is defiled with smoke,
         And Ares fans the flame
 In wildest rage, and laying many low,
         Tramples with foot unclean
         On all men sacred hold.


                              STROPHE III

 And hollow din is heard throughout the town,
         Hemmed in by net of towers;
 And man by man is slaughtered with the spear,
         And cries of bleeding babes,
         Of children at the breast,                                  340
         Are heard in piteous wail,
 And rapine, sister of the plunderer's rush,
         Spoiler with spoiler meets,
 And empty-handed empty-handed calls,
         Wishing for share of gain,
 Both eager for a portion no whit less,
         For more than equal lot
 With what they deem the others' hands have found.


                            ANTISTROPHE III

 And all earth's fruits cast wildly on the ground,                   350
         Meeting the cheerless eye
 Of frugal housewives, give them pain of heart;
         And many a gift of earth
         In formless heaps is whirled
         In waves of nothingness;
 And the young maidens know a sorrow new;
         For now the foe prevails,
 And gains rich prize of wretched captive's bed;                     360
         And now their only hope
 Is that the night of death will come at last,
         Their truest, best ally,
 To rescue them from sorrow fraught with tears.

          _Enter_ ETEOCLES, _followed by his_ Chief Captains,
                           _and by the_ Scout

 _Semi-Chor. A._ The army scout, so deem I, brings to us,
 Dear friends, some tidings new, with quickest speed
 Plying the nimble axles of his feet.

 _Semi-Chor. B._ Yea, the king's self, the son of Œdipus,
 Is nigh to hear the scout's exact report;
 And haste denies him too an even step.

 _Mess._ I knowing well, will our foes' state report,         370
 How each his lot hath stationed at the gates.
 At those of Prœtos, Tydeus thunders loud,
 And him the prophet suffers not to cross
 Ismenos' fords, the victims boding ill.[94]
 And Tydeus, raging eager for the fight,
 Shouts like a serpent in its noontide scream,
 And on the prophet, Œcleus' son, heaps shame,
 That he, in coward fear, doth crouch and fawn
 Before the doom and peril of the fight.
 And with such speech he shakes his triple crest,
 O'ershadowing all his helm, and 'neath his shield                   380
 Bells wrought in bronze ring out their chimes of fear;
 And on his shield he bears this proud device,—
 A firmament enchased, all bright with stars;[95]
 And in the midst the full moon's glittering orb,
 Sovran of stars and eye of Night, shines forth.
 And thus exulting in o'er boastful arms,
 By the stream's bank he shouts in lust of war,
 [E'en as a war-horse panting in his strength
 Against the curb that galls him, who at sound
 Of trumpet's clang chafes hotly.] Whom wilt thou
 Set against him? Who is there strong enough
 When the bolts yield, to guard the Prœtan gates?                    390

 _Eteoc._ No fear have I of any man's array;
 Devices have no power to pierce or wound,
 And crest and bells bite not without a spear;
 And for this picture of the heavens at night,
 Of which thou tellest, glittering on his shield,
 *Perchance his madness may a prophet prove;
 For if night fall upon his dying eyes,
 Then for the man who bears that boastful sign
 It may right well be all too truly named,                           400
 And his own pride shall prophet be of ill.
 And against Tydeus, to defend the gates,
 I'll set this valiant son of Astacos;
 Noble is he, and honouring well the throne
 Of Reverence, and hating vaunting speech,
 Slow to all baseness, unattuned to ill:
 And of the dragon-race that Ares spared[96]
 He as a scion grows, a native true,
 E'en Melanippos; Ares soon will test
 His valour in the hazard of the die:
 And kindred Justice sends him forth to war,
 For her that bore him foeman's spear to check.                      410


                               STROPHE I

 _Chor._ May the Gods grant my champion good success!
         For justly he goes forth
         For this our State to fight;
         But yet I quake with fear
 To see the deaths of those who die for friends.

 _Mess._ Yea, may the Gods give good success to him!
 The Electran gates have fallen to Capaneus,
 A second giant, taller far than he
 Just named, with boast above a mortal's bounds;
 And dread his threats against our towers (O Fortune,                420
 Turn them aside!)—for whether God doth will,
 Or willeth not, he says that he will sack[97]
 The city, nor shall e'en the wrath of Zeus,
 On the plain swooping, turn him from his will;
 And the dread lightnings and hot thunderbolts
 He likens to the heat of noon-day sun.
 And his device, the naked form of one
 Who bears a torch; and bright the blaze shines forth
 And in gold characters he speaks the words,
 “THE CITY I WILL BURN.” Against this man
 Send forth ... but who will meet him in the fight?                  430
 Who, without fear, await this warrior proud?

 _Eteoc._ Herein, too, profit upon profit comes;
 And 'gainst the vain and boastful thoughts of men,
 Their tongue itself is found accuser true.
 Threatening, equipped for work is Capaneus,
 Scorning the Gods: and giving speech full play,
 And in wild joy, though mortal, vents at Zeus,
 High in the heavens, loud-spoken foaming words.
 And well I trust on him shall rightly come
 Fire-bearing thunder, nothing likened then
 To heat of noon-day sun. And so 'gainst him,                        440
 Though very bold of speech, a man is set
 Of fiery temper, Polyphontes strong,
 A trusty bulwark, by the loving grace
 Of guardian Artemis[98] and other Gods.
 Describe another, placed at other gates.


                             ANTISTROPHE I

 _Chor._ A curse on him who 'gainst our city boasts!
         May thunder smite him down                                  450
         Before he force his way
         Into my home, and drive
 Me from my maiden bower with haughty spear?

 _Mess._ And now I'll tell of him who by the gates
 Stands next; for to Eteocles, as third,
 To march his cohort to Neïstian gates,
 Leaped the third lot from upturned brazen helm:
 And he his mares, in head-gear snorting, whirls,
 Full eager at the gates to fall and die;
 Their whistling nozzles of barbaric mode,
 Are filled with loud blast of the panting nostrils.[99]
 In no poor fashion is his shield devised;                           460
 A full-armed warrior climbs a ladder's rungs,
 And mounts his foeman's towers as bent to sack;
 And he too cries, in words of written speech,
 That “NOT E'EN ARES FROM THE TOWERS SHALL DRIVE HIM.”
 Send thou against him some defender true,
 To ward the yoke of bondage from our State.

 _Eteoc._ Such would I send now; by good luck indeed
 He has been sent, his vaunting in his deeds,
 Megareus, Creon's son, who claims descent
 From those as Sparti known, and not by noise
 Of neighings loud of warlike steeds dismayed,                       470
 Will he the gates abandon, but in death
 Will pay our land his nurture's debt in full,[100]
 Or taking two men, and a town to boot,
 (That on the shield,) will deck his father's house
 With those his trophies. Of another tell
 The bragging tale, nor grudge thy words to me.


                               STROPHE II

 _Chor._ Him I wish good success,
 O guardian of my home, and for his foes
         All ill success I pray;
 And since against our land their haughty words
 With maddened soul they speak,
 May Zeus, the sovran judge,
 With fiery, hot displeasure look on them!                           480

 _Mess._ Another stands as fourth at gates hard by,
 Onca-Athenà's, with a shout of war,
 Hippomedon's great form and massive limbs;
 And as he whirled his orb, his vast shield's disk,
 I shuddered; yea, no idle words I speak.
 No cheap and common draughtsman sure was he
 Who wrought this cunning ensign on his shield:
 Typhon emitting from his lips hot blast
 Of darkling smoke, the flickering twin of fire:
 And round the belly of the hollow shield
 A rim was made with wreaths of twisted snakes.                      490
 And he too shouts his war-cry, and in frenzy,
 As man possessed by Ares, hastes to battle,
 Like Thyiad, darting terror from his eyes.[101]
 'Gainst such a hero's might we well may guard;
 Already at the gates men brag of rout.

 _Eteoc._ First, the great Onca-Pallas, dwelling nigh
 Our city's gates, and hating man's bold pride,
 Shall ward him from her nestlings like a snake
 Of venom dread; and next Hyperbios,
 The stalwart son of Œnops, has been chosen,                         500
 A hero 'gainst this hero, willing found
 To try his destiny at Fortune's hest.
 No fault has he in form, or heart, or arms;
 And Hermes with good reason pairs them off;
 For man with man will fight as enemy,
 And on their shields they'll bring opposing Gods;
 For this man beareth Typhon, breathing fire,
 And on Hyperbios' shield sits father Zeus,
 Full firm, with burning thunderbolt in hand;
 And never yet has man seen Zeus, I trow,
 O'ercome. Such then the favour of the Gods,                         510
 We with the winners, they with losers are:[102]
 Good reason then the rivals so should fare,
 If Zeus than Typhon stronger be in fight,
 And to Hyperbios Zeus will saviour prove,
 As that device upon his shield presents him.


                             ANTISTROPHE II

 _Chor._ Now do I trust that he
 Who bears upon his shield the hated form
         Of Power whom Earth doth shroud,
 Antagonist to Zeus, unloved by men
         And by the ageless Gods,
         Before those gates of ours
 To his own hurt may dash his haughty head.                          520

 _Mess._ So may it be! And now the fifth I tell,
 Who the fifth gates, the Northern, occupies,
 Hard by Amphion's tomb, the son of Zeus;
 And by his spear he swears, (which he is bold
 To honour more than God or his own eyes,)
 That he will sack the fort of the Cadmeians
 With that spear's might. So speaks the offspring fair
 Of mother mountain-bred, a stripling hero;
 And the soft down is creeping o'er his cheeks,                      530
 Youth's growth, and hair that floweth full and thick;
 And he with soul, not maiden's like his name,[103]
 But stern, with flashing eye, is standing there.
 Nor stands he at the gate without a vaunt;
 For on his brass-wrought buckler, strong defence,
 Full-orbed, his body guarding, he the shame
 Of this our city bears, the ravenous Sphinx,
 With rivets fixed, all burnished and embossed;[104]
 And under her she holdeth a Cadmeian,
 That so on him most arrows might be shot.
 No chance that he will fight a peddling fight,                      540
 Nor shame the long, long journey he hath come,
 Parthenopæos, in Arcadia born:
 This man did Argos welcome as a guest,
 And now he pays her for her goodly rearing,
 And threatens these our towers with ... God avert it!

 _Eteoc._ Should the Gods give them what they plan 'gainst us,
 Then they, with those their godless boastings high,
 Would perish shamefully and utterly.
 And for this man of Arcady thou tell'st of,
 We have a man who boasts not, but his hand
 Sees the right thing to do;—Actôr, of him                           550
 I named but now the brother,—who no tongue
 Divorced from deeds will ever let within
 Our gates, to spread and multiply our ills,
 Nor him who bears upon his foeman's shield
 The image of the hateful venomed beast;
 But she without shall blame him as he tries
 To take her in, when she beneath our walls
 Gets sorely bruised and battered.[105] And herein,
 If the Gods will, I prophet true shall prove.


                              STROPHE III

 _Chor._ Thy words thrill through my breast;
         My hair stands all on end,
         To hear the boastings great
         Of those who speak great things                             560
         Unholy. May the Gods
         Destroy them in our land!

 _Mess._ A sixth I tell of, one of noblest mood,
 Amphiaraos, seer and warrior famed;
 He, stationed at the Homolôian gates,
 Reproves the mighty Tydeus with sharp words
 As 'murderer,' and 'troubler of the State,'[106]
 'To Argos teacher of all direst ills,
 Erinnys' sumpnour,'[107] 'murder's minister,'                       570
 Whose counsels led Adrastos to these ills.
 *And at thy brother Polyneikes glancing
 With eyes uplifted for his father's fate,
 And ending, twice he syllabled his name,[108]
 And called him, and thus speaketh with his lips:—
 “A goodly deed, and pleasant to the Gods,
 Noble for after age to hear and tell,
 Thy father's city and thy country's Gods
 To waste through might of mercenary host!
 And how shall Justice stay thy mother's tears?[109]                 580
 And how, when conquered, shall thy fatherland,
 Laid waste, become a true ally to thee?
 As for myself, I shall that land make rich,[110]
 A prophet buried in a foeman's soil:
 To arms! I look for no inglorious death.”
 So spake the prophet, bearing full-orbed shield
 Wrought all of bronze, no ensign on that orb.
 He wishes to be just, and not to seem,[111]
 Reaping full harvest from his soul's deep furrows,
 Whence ever new and noble counsels spring.                          590
 I bid thee send defenders wise and brave
 Against him. Dread is he who fears the Gods.

 _Eteoc._ Fie on the chance that brings the righteous man
 Close-mated with the ungodly! In all deeds
 Nought is there worse than evil fellowship,
 A crop men should not reap. Death still is found
 The harvest of the field of frenzied pride;
 For either hath the godly man embarked
 With sailors hot in insolence and guile,[112]
 And perished with the race the Gods did loathe;                     600
 Or just himself, with citizens who wrong
 The stranger and are heedless of the Gods,
 Falling most justly in the self-same snare,
 By God's scourge smitten, shares the common doom.
 And thus this seer I speak of, Œcleus' son,
 Righteous, and wise, and good, and reverent,
 A mighty prophet, mingling with the godless
 *And men full bold of speech in reason's spite,
 Who take long march to reach a far-off city,[113]
 If Zeus so will, shall be hurled down with them.                    610
 And he, I trow, shall not draw nigh the gates,
 Not through faint-heart or any vice of mood,
 But well he knows this war shall bring his death,
 If any fruit is found in Loxias' words;
 And He or holds his speech or speaks in season.
 Yet against him the hero Lasthenes,
 A foe of strangers, at the gates we'll set;
 Old in his mind, his body in its prime,
 His eye swift-footed, and his hand not slow
 To grasp the spear from 'neath the shield laid bare:[114]           620
 Yet 'tis by God's gift men must win success.


                            ANTISTROPHE III

 _Chor._ Hear, O ye Gods! our prayers,
         Our just entreaties grant,
         That so our State be blest.
         Turn ye the toils of war
         Upon the invading host.
         Outside the walls may Zeus
         With thunder smite them low!

 _Mess._ The seventh chief then who at the seventh gate stands,
 Thine own, own brother, I will speak of now,
 What curses on our State he pours, and prays                        630
 That he the towers ascending, and proclaimed
 By herald's voice to all the territory,
 And shouting out the captor's pæan-cry,
 May so fight with thee, slay, and with thee die;
 Or driving thee alive, who did'st him wrong,
 May on thee a vengeance wreak like in kind.
 So clamours he, and bids his father's Gods,
 His country's guardians, look upon his prayers,
 [And grant them all. So Polyneikes prays.]
 And he a new and well-wrought shield doth bear,
 And twofold sign upon it riveted;                                   640
 For there a woman with a stately tread
 Leads one who seems a warrior wrought in gold:
 Justice she calls herself, and thus she speaks:
 “I WILL BRING BACK THIS MAN, AND HE SHALL HAVE
 THE CITY AND HIS FATHER'S DWELLING-PLACE.”
 Such are the signs and mottoes of those men;
 And thou, know well whom thou dost mean to send:
 So thou shalt never blame my heraldings;
 And thou thyself know how to steer the State.

 _Eteoc._ O frenzy-stricken, hated sore of Gods!              650
 O woe-fraught race (my race!) of Œdipus!
 Ah me! my father's curse is now fulfilled;
 But neither is it meet to weep or wail,
 Lest cry more grievous on the issue come.
 Of Polyneikes, name and omen true,
 We soon shall know what way his badge shall end,
 Whether his gold-wrought letters shall restore him,
 His shield's great swelling words with frenzied soul.
 An if great Justice, Zeus's virgin child,
 Ruled o'er his words and acts, this might have been;                660
 But neither when he left his mother's womb,
 Nor in his youth, nor yet in ripening age,
 Nor when his beard was gathered on his chin,
 Did Justice count him meet for fellowship;
 Nor do I think that she befriends him now
 In this great outrage on his father's land.
 Yea, justly Justice would as falsely named
 Be known, if she with one all-daring joined.
 In this I trust, and I myself will face him:
 Who else could claim a greater right than I?                        670
 Brother with brother fighting, king with king,
 And foe with foe, I'll stand. Come, quickly fetch
 My greaves that guard against the spear and stones.

 _Chor._ Nay, dearest friend, thou son of Œdipus,
 Be ye not like to him with that ill name.
 It is enough Cadmeian men should fight
 Against the Argives. That blood may be cleansed;
 But death so murderous of two brothers born,
 This is pollution that will ne'er wax old.

 _Eteoc._ If a man must bear evil, let him still              680
 Be without shame—sole profit that in death.
 [No glory comes of base and evil deeds].

 _Chor._ What dost thou crave, my son? Let no ill fate,
         Frenzied and hot for war,
         Carry thee headlong on;
 Check the first onset of an evil lust.

 _Eteoc._ Since God so hotly urges on the matter,
 Let all of Laios' race whom Phœbos hates,
 Drift with the breeze upon Cokytos' wave.

 _Chor._ An over-fierce and passionate desire
         Stirs thee and pricks thee on
         To work an evil deed
 Of guilt of blood thy hand should never shed.                       690

 _Eteoc._ Nay, my dear father's curse, in full-grown hate,
 Dwells on dry eyes that cannot shed a tear,
 And speaks of gain before the after-doom.

 _Chor._ But be not thou urged on. The coward's name
         Shall not be thine, for thou
         Hast ordered well thy life.
 Dark-robed Erinnys enters not the house,
         When at men's hands the Gods
         Accept their sacrifice.

 _Eteoc._ As for the Gods, they scorned us long ago,
 And smile but on the offering of our deaths;                        700
 What boots it then on death's doom still to fawn?

 _Chor._ Nay do it now, while yet 'tis in thy power;[115]
         Perchance may fortune shift
         With tardy change of mood,
 And come with spirit less implacable:
         At present fierce and hot
         She waxeth in her rage.

 _Eteoc._ Yea, fierce and hot the Curse of Œdipus;
 And all too true the visions of the night,
 My father's treasured store distributing.

 _Chor._ Yield to us women, though thou lov'st us not.

 _Eteoc._ Speak then what may be done, and be not long.       710

 _Chor._ Tread not the path that to the seventh gate leads.

 _Eteoc._ Thou shall not blunt my sharpened edge with words.

 _Chor._ And yet God loves the victory that submits.[116]

 _Eteoc._ That word a warrior must not tolerate.

 _Chor._ Dost thou then haste thy brother's blood to shed?

 _Eteoc._ If the Gods grant it, he shall not 'scape harm.

                               [_Exeunt_ ETEOCLES, Scout, _and_ Captains


                               STROPHE I

 _Chor._ I fear her might who doth this whole house wreck,
         The Goddess unlike Gods,
 The prophetess of evil all too true,
 The Erinnys of thy father's imprecations,                           720
         Lest she fulfil the curse,
         O'er-wrathful, frenzy-fraught,
         The curse of Œdipus,
         Laying his children low.
         This Strife doth urge them on.


                             ANTISTROPHE I

 And now a stranger doth divide the lots,
 The Chalyb,[117] from the Skythians emigrant,
 The stern distributor of heaped-up wealth,
 The iron that hath assigned them just so much
         Of land as theirs, no more,
         As may suffice for them
         As grave when they shall fall,
         Without or part or lot
         In the broad-spreading plains.                              730


                               STROPHE II

         And when the hands of each
         The other's blood have shed,
         And the earth's dust shall drink
         The black and clotted gore,
         Who then can purify?
         Who cleanse thee from the guilt?
         Ah me! O sorrows new,
 That mingle with the old woes of our house!


                             ANTISTROPHE II

         I tell the ancient tale
         Of sin that brought swift doom;                             740
         Till the third age it waits,
         Since Laios, heeding not
         Apollo's oracle,
         (Though spoken thrice to him
     In Pythia's central shrine,)
 That dying childless, he should save the State.


                              STROPHE III

 But he by those he loved full rashly swayed,
         Doom for himself begat,
         His murderer Œdipus,                                        750
         Who dared to sow in field
         Unholy, whence he sprang,
         A root of blood-flecked woe.
         Madness together brought
         Bridegroom and bride accursed.


                            ANTISTROPHE III

 And now the sea of evil pours its flood:
         This falling, others rise,
         As with a triple crest,
         Which round the State's stern roars:
         And but a bulwark slight,
         A tower's poor breadth, defends:                            760
         And lest the city fall
         With its two kings I fear.


                               STROPHE IV

 *And that atonement of the ancient curse
         Receives fulfilment now;[118]
 *And when they come, the evils pass not by.
 E'en so the wealth of sea-adventurers,
         When heaped up in excess,
         Leads but to cargo from the stern thrown out.[119]


                             ANTISTROPHE IV

 For whom of mortals did the Gods so praise,
         And fellow-worshippers,                                     770
 *And race of those who feed their flocks and herds[120]
 As much as then they honoured Œdipus,
         Who from our country's bounds
 Had driven the monster, murderess of men?


                               STROPHE V

         And when too late he knew,
 Ah, miserable man! his wedlock dire,
         Vexed sore with that dread shame,
         With heart to madness driven,
         He wrought a twofold ill,
 And with the hand that smote his father's life                      780
 *Blinded the eyes that might his sons have seen.


                             ANTISTROPHE V

         And with a mind provoked
 By nurture scant, he at his sons did hurl[121]
         His curses dire and dark,
         (Ah, bitter curses those!)
         That they with spear in hand
 Should one day share their father's wealth; and I
 Fear now lest swift Erinnys should fulfil them.

                           _Enter_ Messenger

 _Mess._ Be of good cheer, ye maidens, mother-reared;
 Our city has escaped the yoke of bondage,                           790
 The boasts of mighty men are fallen low,
 And this our city in calm waters floats,
 And, though by waves lashed, springs not any leak.
 Our fortress still holds out, and we did guard
 The gates with champions who redeemed their pledge.
 In the six gateways almost all goes well;
 But the seventh gate did King Apollo choose,[122]
 Seventh mighty chief, avenging Laios' want
 Of counsel on the sons of Œdipus.

 _Chor._ What new disaster happens to our city?[123]          800

 _Mess._ The city's saved, but both the royal brothers,...

 _Chor._ Who? and what of them? I'm distraught with fear.

 _Mess._ Be calm, and hear: the sons of Œdipus,...

 _Chor._ Oh wretched me! a prophet I of ill!

 _Mess._ Slain by each other, earth has drunk their blood.

 _Chor._ Came they to that? 'Tis dire; yet tell it me.

 _Mess._ Too true, by brother's hand our chiefs are slain.

 _Chor._ What, did the brother's hands the brother lay?

 _Mess._ No doubt is there that they are laid in dust.

 _Chor._ Thus was there then a common fate for both?

 _Mess._ *Yea, it lays low the whole ill-fated race.

 _Chor._ These things give cause for gladness and for tears,  810
 Seeing that our city prospers, and our lords,
 The generals twain, with well-wrought Skythian steel,
 Have shared between them all their store of goods,
 And now shall have their portion in a grave,
 Borne on, as spake their father's grievous curse.[124]

 _Mess._ [The city's saved, but of the brother-kings
 The earth has drunk the blood, each slain by each.]

 _Chor._ Great Zeus! and ye, O Gods!
 Guardians of this our town,
 Who save in very deed
 The towers of Cadmos old,                                           820
         Shall I rejoice and shout
         Over the happy chance
         That frees our State from harm;
         Or weep that ill-starred pair,
 The war-chiefs, childless and most miserable,
         Who, true to that ill name
 Of Polyneikes, died in impious mood,
         Contending overmuch?


                                STROPHE

         Oh dark, and all too true
 That curse of Œdipus and all his race,[125]
 An evil chill is falling on my heart,                               830
         And, like a Thyiad wild,
 Over his grave I sing a dirge of grief,
 Hearing the dead have died by evil fate,
         Each in foul bloodshed steeped;
 Ah me! Ill-omened is the spear's accord.[126]


                              ANTISTROPHE

         It hath wrought out its end,
 And hath not failed, that prayer the father poured;
 And Laios' reckless counsels work till now:
         I fear me for the State;
 The oracles have not yet lost their edge;                           840
 O men of many sorrows, ye have wrought
 This deed incredible;
 Not now in word come woes most lamentable.

                  [_As the Chorus are speaking, the bodies of_ ETEOCLES
                      _and_ POLYNEIKES _are brought in solemn procession
                      by_ Theban Citizens


                                 EPODE

         Yea, it is all too clear,
 The herald's tale of woe comes full in sight;
 Twofold our cares, twin evils born of pride,
         Murderous, with double doom,
 Wrought unto full completeness all these ills.
         What shall I say? What else
 Are they than woes that make this house their home?
 But oh! my friends, ply, ply with swift, strong gale,
 That even stroke of hands upon your head,[127]                      850
 In funeral order, such as evermore
         O'er Acheron sends on
 *That bark of State, dark-rigged, accursed its voyage,
 Which nor Apollo visits nor the sun,[128]
         On to the shore unseen,
         The resting-place of all.

                      [ISMENE _and_ ANTIGONE _are seen approaching in
                          mourning garments, followed by a procession of
                          women wailing and lamenting_

 For see, they come to bitter deed called forth,
 Ismene and the maid Antigone,
         To wail their brothers' fall;
         With little doubt I deem,
 That they will pour from fond, deep-bosomed breasts
         A worthy strain of grief:
         But it is meet that we,
         Before we hear their cry,                                   860
 Should utter the harsh hymn Erinnys loves,
         And sing to Hades dark
         The Pæan of distress.
 O ye, most evil-fated in your kin,
 Of all who guard their robes with maiden's band,
 I weep and wail, and feigning know I none,
         That I should fail to speak
         My sorrow from my heart.


                               STROPHE I

 _Semi-Chor. A._ Alas! alas!
 Men of stern mood, who would not list to friends,
         Unwearied in all ills,                                      870
 Seizing your father's house, O wretched ones
         With the spear's murderous point.

 _Semi-Chor. B._ Yea, wretched they who found a wretched doom,
         With havoc of the house.


                             ANTISTROPHE I

 _Semi-Chor. A._ Alas! alas!
 Ye who laid low the ancient walls of home,
         On sovereignty, ill won,
 Your eyes have looked, and ye at last are brought
         To concord by the sword.

 _Semi-Chor. B._ Yea, of a truth, the curse of Œdipus         880
         Erinnys dread fulfils.


                               STROPHE II

 _Semi-Chor. A._ Yea, smitten through the heart,
 Smitten through sides where flowed the blood of brothers.
         Ah me! ye doomed of God!
         Ah me! the curses dire
 Of deaths ye met with each at other's hands!

 _Semi-Chor. B._ Thou tell'st of men death-smitten through and through,
         Both in their homes and lives,
         With wrath beyond all speech,                               890
         And doom of discord fell,
 That sprang from out the curse their father spake.


                             ANTISTROPHE II

 _Semi-Chor. A._ Yea, through the city runs
 A wailing cry. The high towers wail aloud;
 Wails all the plain that loves her heroes well;
         And to their children's sons
         The wealth will go for which
 The strife of those ill-starred ones brought forth death.

 _Semi-Chor. B._ Quick to resent, they shared their fortune so,
         That each like portion won;
         *Nor can their friends regard
         Their umpire without blame;                                 900
 Nor is our voice in thanks to Ares raised.


                              STROPHE III

 _Semi-Chor. A._ By the sword smitten low,
         Thus are they now;
         By the sword smitten low,
         There wait them ... Nay,
         Doth one perchance ask what?
 Shares in their old ancestral sepulchres.

 _Semi-Chor. B._ *The sorrow of the house is borne to them
         By my heart-rending wail.
         Mine own the cries I pour;
         Mine own the woes I weep,
 Bitter and joyless, shedding truest tears                           910
 From heart that faileth, even as they fall,
 For these two kingly chiefs.


                            ANTISTROPHE III

 _Semi-Chor. A._ Yes; one may say of them,
         That wretched pair,
         That they much ill have wrought
         To their own host;
         Yea, and to alien ranks
 Of many nations fallen in the fray.

 _Semi-Chor._ B. Ah! miserable she who bare those twain,
         'Bove all of women born
         Who boast a mother's name!                                  920
         Taking her son, her own,
         As spouse, she bare these children, and they both,
 By mutual slaughter and by brothers' hands,
         Have found their end in death.


                               STROPHE IV

 _Semi-Chor. A._ Yes; of the same womb born, and doomèd both,
         *Not as friends part, they fell,
         In strife to madness pushed
         In this their quarrel's end.

 _Semi-Chor. B._ The quarrel now is hushed,
 And in the ensanguined earth their lives are blent;                 930
         Full near in blood are they.
         Stern umpire of their strifes
 Has been the stranger from beyond the sea,[129]
 Fresh from the furnace, keen and sharpened steel.
         Stern, too, is Ares found,
         Distributing their goods,
 Making their father's curses all too true.


                             ANTISTROPHE IV

 _Semi-Chor. A._ At last they have their share, ah, wretched ones!
         Of burdens sent from God.                                   940
         And now beneath them lies
         A boundless wealth of——earth.

 _Semi-Chor. B._ O ye who your own race
 Have made to burgeon out with many woes!
         Over the end at last
         The brood of Curses raise
 Their shrill, sharp cry of lamentation loud,
 The race being put to flight of utmost rout,
         And Atè's trophy stands,
         Where in the gates they fell;
 And Fate, now both are conquered, rests at last.                    950

          _Enter_ ANTIGONE _and_ ISMENE, _followed by mourning
                             maidens_[130]

 _Ant._ Thou wast smitten, and thou smotest.

 _Ism._ Thou did'st slaughter, and wast slaughtered.

 _Ant._ Thou with spear to death did'st smite him.

 _Ism._ Thou with spear to death wast smitten.

 _Ant._ Oh, the woe of all your labours!

 _Ism._ Oh, the woe of all ye suffered!

 _Ant._ Pour the cry of lamentation.

 _Ism._ Pour the tears of bitter weeping.

 _Ant._ There in death thou liest prostrate.

 _Ism._ Having wrought a great destruction.


                                STROPHE

 _Ant._ Ah! my mind is crazed with wailing.                   960

 _Ism._ Yea, my heart within me groaneth.

 _Ant._ Thou for whom the city weepeth!

 _Ism._ Thou too, doomed to all ill-fortune!

 _Ant._ By a loved hand thou hast perished.

 _Ism._ And a loved form thou hast slaughtered.

 _Ant._ Double woes are ours to tell of.

 _Ism._ Double woes too ours to look on.

 _Ant._ *Twofold sorrows from near kindred.

 _Ism._ *Sisters we by brothers standing.

 _Ant._ Terrible are they to tell of.                         970

 _Ism._ Terrible are they to look on.

 _Chor._ Ah me, thou Destiny,
 Giver of evil gifts, and working woe,
 And thou dread spectral form of Œdipus,
         And swarth Erinnys too,
         A mighty one art thou.


                              ANTISTROPHE

 _Ant._ Ah me! ah me! woes dread to look on....

 _Ism._ Ye showed to me, returned from exile.

 _Ant._ Not, when he had slain, returned he.

 _Ism._ Nay, he, saved from exile, perished.                  980

 _Ant._ Yea, I trow too well, he perished.

 _Ism._ And his brother, too, he murdered.

 _Ant._ Woeful, piteous, are those brothers!

 _Ism._ Woeful, piteous, all they suffered!

 _Ant._ Woes of kindred wrath enkindling!

 _Ism._ Saturate with threefold horrors!

 _Ant._ Terrible are they to tell of.

 _Ism._ Terrible are they to look on.

 _Chor._ Ah me, thou Destiny,
 Giver of evil gifts, and stern of soul,
 And thou dread spectral form of Œdipus,                             990
         And swarth Erinnys too,
         A mighty one art thou.


                                 EPODE

 _Ant._ Thou, then, by full trial knowest....

 _Ism._ Thou, too, no whit later learning....

 _Ant._ When thou cam'st back to this city[131]....

 _Ism._ Rival to our chief in warfare.

 _Ant._ Woe, alas! for all our troubles!

 _Ism._ Woe, alas! for all our evils!

 _Ant._ Evils fallen on our houses!

 _Ism._ Evils fallen on our country!

 _Ant._ And on me before all others....

 _Ism._ And to me the future waiting....                     1000

 _Ant._ Woe for those two brothers luckless!

 _Ism._ King Eteocles, our leader!

 _Ant._ Oh, before all others wretched!

 _Ism._ .      .      .      .      .

 _Ant._ Ah, by Atè frenzy-stricken!

 _Ism._ Ah, where now shall they be buried?

 _Ant._ There where grave is highest honour.

 _Ism._ Ah, the woe my father wedded!

                            _Enter a_ Herald

 _Her._ 'Tis mine the judgment and decrees to publish
 Of this Cadmeian city's counsellors:
 It is decreed Eteocles to honour,
 For his good-will towards this land of ours,                       1010
 With seemly burial, such as friend may claim;
 For warding off our foes he courted death;
 Pure as regards his country's holy things,
 Blameless he died where death the young beseems;
 This then I'm ordered to proclaim of him.
 But for his brother's, Polyneikes' corpse,
 To cast it out unburied, prey for dogs,
 As working havoc on Cadmeian land,
 Unless some God had hindered by the spear
 Of this our prince;[132] and he, though, dead, shall gain          1020
 The curse of all his father's Gods, whom he

                                               [_Pointing to_ POLYNEIKES

 With alien host dishonouring, sought to take
 Our city. Him by ravenous birds interred
 Ingloriously, they sentence to receive
 His full deserts; and none may take in hand
 To heap up there a tomb, nor honour him
 With shrill-voiced wailings; but he still must lie,
 Without the meed of burial by his friends.
 So do the high Cadmeian powers decree.

 _Ant._ And I those rulers of Cadmeians tell,[133]           1030
 That if no other care to bury him,
 I will inter him, facing all the risk,
 Burying my brother: nor am I ashamed
 To thwart the State in rank disloyalty;
 Strange power there is in ties of blood, that we,
 Born of woe-laden mother, sire ill-starred,
 Are bound by: therefore of thy full free-will,
 Share thou, my soul, in woes he did not will,
 Thou living, he being dead, with sister's heart.
 And this I say, no wolves with ravening maw,
 Shall tear his flesh—No! no! let none think that!
 For tomb and burial I will scheme for him,                         1040
 Though I be but weak woman, bringing earth
 Within my byssine raiment's fold, and so
 Myself will bury him; let no man think
 (I say't again) aught else. Take heart, my soul!
 There shall not fail the means effectual.

 _Her._ I bid thee not defy the State in this.

 _Ant._ I bid thee not proclaim vain words to me.

 _Her._ Stern is the people now, with victory flushed.

 _Ant._ Stern let them be, he shall not tombless lie.

 _Her._ And wilt thou honour whom the State doth loathe?

 _Ant._ *Yea, from the Gods he gets an honour due.[134]1050

 _Her._ It was not so till he this land attacked.

 _Ant._ He, suffering evil, evil would repay.

 _Her._ Not against one his arms were turned, but all.

 _Ant._ Strife is the last of Gods to end disputes:
 Him I will bury; talk no more of it.

 _Her._ Choose for thyself then, I forbid the deed.

 _Chor._ Alas! alas! alas!
         Ye haughty boasters, race-destroying,
         Now Fates and now Erinnyes, smiting
         The sons of Œdipus, ye slew them,
         With a root-and-branch destruction.                        1060
         What shall I then do, what suffer?
         What shall I devise in counsel?
         How should I dare nor to weep thee,
         Nor escort thee to the burial?
         But I tremble and I shrink from
         All the terrors which they threatened,
         They who are my fellow-townsmen.
         Many mourners thou (_looking to the bier of_ ETEOCLES) shalt
            meet with;
         But he, lost one, unlamented,
         With his sister's wailing only
         Passeth. Who with this complieth?

 _Semi-Chor. A_. Let the city doom or not doom
         Those who weep for Polyneikes;
         We will go, and we will bury,                              1070
         Maidens we in sad procession;
         For the woe to all is common,
         And our State with voice uncertain,
         Of the claims of Right and Justice;
         Hither, thither, shifts its praises.

 _Semi-Chor. B._ We will thus, our chief attending,
         Speak, as speaks the State, our praises:
         Of the claims of Right and Justice;[135]
         For next those the Blessed Rulers,
         And the strength of Zeus, he chiefly
         Saved the city of Cadmeians
         From the doom of fell destruction,
         From the doom of whelming utter,
         In the flood of alien warriors.

                       [_Exeunt_ ANTIGONE _and Semi-Chorus A., following
                           the corpse of_ POLYNEIKES; ISMENE
                           _and Semi-Chorus B. that of_ ETEOCLES.

-----

Footnote 73:

  Probably directed against the tendency of the Athenians, as shown in
  their treatment of Miltiades, and later in that of Thukydides, to
  punish their unsuccessful generals, “_pour encourager les autres_.”

Footnote 74:

  Teiresias, as in Sophocles (_Antig._ v. 1005), sitting, though blind,
  and listening, as the birds flit by him, and the flames burn steadily
  or fitfully; a various reading gives “apart from sight.”

Footnote 75:

  Enyo, the goddess of war, and companion of Ares.

Footnote 76:

  Amphiaraos the seer had prophesied that Adrastos alone should return
  home in safety. On his car, therefore, the other chieftains hung the
  clasps, or locks of hair, or other memorials which in the event of
  their death were to be taken to their parents.

Footnote 77:

  The Hellenic feeling, such as the Platæans appealed to in the
  Peloponnesian war (Thuc. iii. 58, 59), that it was noble and right for
  Hellenes to destroy a city of the barbarians, but that they should
  spare one belonging to a people of their own stock.

Footnote 78:

  The characteristic feature of the Argive soldiers was, that they bore
  a shield painted white (comp. Sophocles, _Antig._ v. 114). The leaders
  alone appear to have embellished this with devices and mottoes.

Footnote 79:

  In solemn supplications, the litanies of the ancient world, especially
  in those to Pallas, the suppliants carried with them in procession the
  shawl or _peplos_ of the Goddess, and with it enwrapt her statue. To
  carry boughs of trees in the hands was one of the uniform, probably
  indispensable, accompaniments of such processions.

Footnote 80:

  The words recall our thoughts to the original use of the trident,
  which became afterwards a symbol of Poseidon, as employed by the
  sailors of Hellas to spear or harpoon the larger fish of the
  Archipelago. Comp. _Pers._ v. 426, where the slaughter of a defeated
  army is compared to tunny-fishing.

Footnote 81:

  Cadmos, probably “the man from the East,” the Phœnikian who had
  founded Thebes, and sown the dragon's seed, and taught men a Semitic
  alphabet for the non-Semitic speech of Hellas.

Footnote 82:

  Worthy of his name as the Wolf-destroyer, mighty to destroy his foes.

Footnote 83:

  Possibly “_from_ battlements attacked.” In the primitive sieges of
  Greek warfare stones were used as missiles alike by besieged and
  besiegers.

Footnote 84:

  The name of Onca belonged especially to the Theban worship of Pallas,
  and was said to have been of Phœnikian origin, introduced by Cadmos.
  There seems, however, to have been a town Onkæ in Bœotia, with which
  the name was doubtless connected.

Footnote 85:

  “Alien,” on account of the difference of dialect between the speech of
  Argos and that of Bœotia, though both were Hellenic.

Footnote 86:

  The vehemence with which Eteocles reproves the wild frenzied wailing
  of the Chorus may be taken as an element of the higher culture showing
  itself in Athenian life, which led Solon to restrain such lamentations
  by special laws (Plutarch, _Solon_, c. 20). Here, too, we note in
  Æschylos an echo of the teaching of Epimenides.

Footnote 87:

  As now the sailor of the Mediterranean turns to the image of his
  patron saint, so of old he ran in his distress to the figure of his
  God upon the prow of his ship (often, as in Acts xxviii. II, that of
  the _Dioscuri_), and called to it for deliverance (comp. Jonah i. 8).

Footnote 88:

  Eteocles seems to wish for a short, plain prayer for deliverance,
  instead of the cries and supplications and vain repetitions of the
  Chorus.

Footnote 89:

  The thought thus expressed was, that the Gods, yielding to the
  mightier law of destiny, or in their wrath at the guilt of men, left
  the city before its capture. The feeling was all but universal. Its
  two representative instances are found in Virgil, _Æn._ 351—

                  “Excessere omnes adytis arisque relictis
                  Di quibus imperium hoc steterat;”

  and the narrative given alike by Tacitus (_Hist._ v. 13), and Josephus
  (_Bell. Jud._ vi. 5, 3), that the cry “Let us depart hence,” was heard
  at midnight through the courts of the Temple, before the destruction
  of Jerusalem.

Footnote 90:

  _Sc._ Blood must be shed in war. Ares would not be Ares without it. It
  is better to take it as it comes.

Footnote 91:

  _Sc._, the company of Gods, Pallas, Hera and the others whom the
  Chorus had invoked.

Footnote 92:

  Reference to this custom, which has passed from Pagan temples into
  Christian churches, is found in the _Agamemnon_, v. 562. It was
  connected, of course, with the general practice of offering as _ex
  votos_ any personal ornaments or clothing as a token of thanksgiving
  for special mercies.

Footnote 93:

  Rivers and streams as the children of Tethys and Okeanos.

Footnote 94:

  Here, as in v. 571, Tydeus appears as the real leader of the
  expedition, who had persuaded Adrastos and the other chiefs to join in
  it, and Amphiaraos, the prophet, the son of Œcleus, as having all
  along foreseen its disastrous issue. The account of the expedition in
  the _Œdipus at Colonos_ (1300-1330) may be compared with this.

Footnote 95:

  The legend of the Medusa's head on the shield of Athena shows the
  practice of thus decorating shields to have been of remote date. In
  Homer it does not appear as common, and the account given of the
  shield of Achilles lays stress upon the work of the artist (Hephæstos)
  who wrought the shield in relief, not, as here, upon painted insignia.
  They were obviously common in the time of Æschylos.

Footnote 96:

  The older families of Thebes boasted that they sprang from the
  survivors of the Sparti, who, sprung from the Dragon's teeth, waged
  deadly war against each other, till all but five were slain. The later
  settlers, who were said to have come with Cadmos, stood to these as
  the “greater” to the “lesser _gentes_” at Rome.

Footnote 97:

  So in the _Antigone_ of Sophocles (v. 134), Capaneus appears as the
  special representative of boastful, reckless impiety.

Footnote 98:

  Artemis, as one of the special Deities to whom Thebes was consecrated.

Footnote 99:

  Apparently an Asiatic invention, to increase the terror of an attack
  of war-chariots.

Footnote 100:

  The phrase and thought were almost proverbial in Athens. Men, as
  citizens, were thought of as fed at a common table, bound to
  contribute their gifts to the common stock. When they offered up their
  lives in battle, they were giving, as Pericles says (Thucyd. ii. 43),
  their noblest “contribution,” paying in full their subscription to the
  society of which they were members.

Footnote 101:

  Thyiad, another name for the Mænads, the frenzied attendants on
  Dionysos.

Footnote 102:

  _Sc._, in the legends of Typhon, not he, but Zeus, had proved the
  conqueror. The warrior, therefore, who chose Typhon for his badge was
  identifying himself with the losing, not the winning side.

Footnote 103:

  The name, as we are told in v. 542, is Parthenopæos, the maiden-faced.

Footnote 104:

  The Sphinx, besides its general character as an emblem of terror, had,
  of course, a special meaning as directed to the Thebans. The warrior
  who bore it threatened to renew the old days when the monster whom
  Œdipus had overcome had laid waste their city.

Footnote 105:

  _Sc._, the Sphinx on his shield will not be allowed to enter the city.
  It will only serve as a mark, attracting men to attack both it and the
  warrior who bears it.

Footnote 106:

  The quarrel between Tydeus and the seer Amphiaraos had been already
  touched upon.

Footnote 107:

  I have used the old English word to express a term of like technical
  use in Athenian law processes. As the “sumpnour” called witnesses or
  parties to a suit into court, so Tydeus had summoned the Erinnys to do
  her work of destruction.

Footnote 108:

  _Sc._, so pronounced his name as to emphasise the significance of its
  two component parts, as indicating that he who bore it was a man of
  much contention.

Footnote 109:

  The words are obscure, but seem to refer to the badge of Polyneikes,
  the figure of Justice described in v. 643 as on his shield. How shall
  that Justice, the seer asks, console Jocasta for her son's death?
  Another rendering gives,

             “And how shall Justice quench a mother's life?”

  the “mother” being the country against which Polyneikes wars.

Footnote 110:

  The words had a twofold fulfilment (1) in the burial of Amphiaraos, in
  the Theban soil; and (2) in the honour which accrued to Thebes after
  his death, through the fame of the oracle at his shrine.

Footnote 111:

  The passage cannot be passed over without noticing the old tradition
  (Plutarch, _Aristeid._ c. 3), that when the actor uttered these words,
  he and the whole audience looked to Aristeides, surnamed the Just, as
  recognising that the words were true of him as they were of no one
  else. “Best,” instead of “just,” is, however, a very old various
  reading.

Footnote 112:

  If the former reference to Aristeides be admitted, we can scarcely
  avoid seeing in this passage an allusion to Themistocles, as one with
  whose reckless and democratic policy it was dangerous for the more
  conservative leader to associate himself.

Footnote 113:

  The far-off city, not of Thebes, but of Hades. In the legend of
  Thebes, the earth opened and swallowed up Amphiaraos, as in 583.

Footnote 114:

  The short spear was usually carried under the shelter of the shield;
  when brought into action it was, of course, laid bare.

Footnote 115:

  Perhaps “since death is at nigh hand.”

Footnote 116:

  The Chorus means that if Eteocles would allow himself to be overcome
  in this contest of his wishes with their prayers the Gods would honour
  that defeat as if it were indeed a victory. He makes answer that the
  very thought of being overcome implied in the word “defeat” in
  anything is one which the true warrior cannot bear.

Footnote 117:

  The “Chalyb stranger” is the sword, thought of as taking its name from
  the Skythian tribe of the Chalybes, between Colchis and Armenia, and
  passing through the Thrakians into Greece.

Footnote 118:

  The two brothers, _i.e._, are set at one again, but it is not in the
  bonds of friendship, but in those of death.

Footnote 119:

  The image meets us again in _Agam._ 980. Here the thought is, that a
  man too prosperous is like a ship too heavily freighted. He must part
  with a portion of his possession in order to save the rest. Not to
  part with them leads, when the storm rages, to an enforced abandonment
  and utter loss.

Footnote 120:

  Another reading gives—

                     “And race of those who crowd the Agora.”

Footnote 121:

  This seems to have been one form of the legends as to the cause of the
  curse which Œdipus had launched upon his sons, An alternative
  rendering is—

                     And with a mind enraged
             At thought of what they were whom he had reared,
                     He at his sons did hurl
                     His curses dire and dark.

Footnote 122:

  _Sc._, when Eteocles fell, Apollo took his place at the seventh gate,
  and turned the tide of war in favour of the Thebans.

Footnote 123:

  I follow in this dialogue the arrangement which Paley adopts from
  Hermann.

Footnote 124:

  There seems an intentional ambiguity. They are “borne on,” but it is
  as the corpses of the dead are borne to the sepulchre.

Footnote 125:

  Not here the curse uttered by Œdipus, but that which rested on him and
  all his kin. There is possibly an allusion to the curse which Pelops
  is said to have uttered against Laios when he stole his son
  Chrysippos. Comp. v. 837.

Footnote 126:

  As in v. 763 we read of the brothers as made one in death, so now of
  the concord which is wrought out by conflict, the concord, _i.e._, of
  the grave.

Footnote 127:

  The Chorus are called on to change their character, and to pass from
  the attitude of suppliants, with outstretched arms, to that of
  mourners at a funeral, beating on their breasts. But, perhaps, the
  call is addressed to the mourners who are seen approaching with Ismene
  and Antigone.

Footnote 128:

  The thought is drawn from the _theoris_ or pilgrim-ship, which went
  with snow-white sails, and accompanied by joyful pæans, on a solemn
  mission from Athens to Delos. In contrast with this type of joy,
  Æschylos draws the picture of the boat of Charon, which passes over
  the gloomy pool accompanied by the sighs and gestures of bitter
  lamentation. So, in the old Attic legend, the ship that annually
  carried seven youths and maidens to the Minotaur of Crete was
  conspicuous for its black sails.

Footnote 129:

  The “Chalyb,” or iron sword, which the Hellenes had imported from the
  Skythians. Comp. vv. 70. 86.

Footnote 130:

  The lyrical, operative character of Greek tragedies has to be borne in
  mind as we read passages like that which follows. They were not meant
  to be _read_. Uttered in a passionate recitative, accompanied by
  expressive action, they probably formed a very effective element in
  the actual representation of the tragedy. We may look on it as the
  only extant specimen of the kind of wailing which was characteristic
  of Eastern burials, and which was slowly passing away in Greece under
  the influence of a higher culture. The early fondness of Æschylos for
  a _finale_ of this nature is seen also in _The Persians_, and in a
  more solemn and subdued form, in the _Eumenides_. The feeling that
  there was something barbaric in these untoward displays of grief,
  showed itself alike in the legislation of Solon, and the eloquence of
  Pericles.

Footnote 131:

  Here, and perhaps throughout, we must think of Antigone as addressing
  and looking on the corpse of Polyneikes, Ismene on that of Eteocles.

Footnote 132:

  Perhaps

                “Unless some God had stood against the spear
                This chief did wield.”

Footnote 133:

  The speech of the Antigone becomes the starting-point, in the hands of
  Sophocles, of the noblest of his tragedies. The denial of burial, it
  will be remembered, was looked on as not merely an indignity and
  outrage against the feelings of the living, but as depriving the souls
  of the dead of all rest and peace. As such it was the punishment of
  parricides and traitors.

Footnote 134:

  The words are obscure enough, the point lying, it may be, in their
  ambiguity. Antigone here, as in the tragedy of Sophocles, pleads that
  the Gods have pardoned; they still command and love the reverence for
  the dead, which she is about to show. The herald catches up her words
  and takes them in another sense, as though all the honour he had met
  with from the Gods had been defeat, and death, and shame, as the
  reward of his sacrilege. Another rendering, however, gives—

             “Yes, so the Gods have done with honouring him.”

Footnote 135:

  The words are probably a protest against the changeableness of the
  Athenian _demos_, as seen especially in their treatment of Aristeides.
