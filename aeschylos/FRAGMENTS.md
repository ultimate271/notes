                          APHRODITE _loquitur_

 The pure, bright heaven still yearns to blend with earth,
 And earth is filled with love for marriage-rites,
 And from the kindly sky the rain-shower falls
 And fertilises earth, and earth for men
 Yields grass for sheep, and corn, Demêter's gift;
 And from its wedlock with the South the fruit
 Is ripened in its season; and of this,
 All this, I am the cause accessory.


                                  123

 So, in the Libyan fables, it is told
 That once an eagle, stricken with a dart,
 Said, when he saw the fashion of the shaft,
 “With our own feathers, not by others' hands,
 Are we now smitten.”


                                  147

 Of all the Gods, Death only craves not gifts:
 Nor sacrifice, nor yet drink-offering poured
 Avails; no altars hath he, nor is soothed
 By hymns of praise. From him alone of all
 The powers of Heaven Persuasion holds aloof.


                                  151

 When 'tis God's will to bring an utter doom
 Upon a house, He first in mortal men
 Implants what works it out.


                                  162

 The words of Truth are ever simplest found.


                                  163

 What good is found in life that still brings pain?


                                  174

 To many mortals silence great gain brings.


                                  229

 O Death the Healer, scorn thou not, I pray,
 To come to me: of cureless ills thou art
 The one physician. Pain lays not its touch
 Upon a corpse.


                                  230

 When the wind
 Nor suffers us to leave the port, nor stay.


                                  243

 And if thou wish to benefit the dead,
 'Tis all as one as if thou injured'st them,
 And they nor sorrow nor delight can feel:
 Yet higher than we are is Nemesis,
 And Justice taketh vengeance for the dead.


                                  266

                   THETIS _on the death of Achilles_

 Life free from sickness, and of many years,
 And in a word a fortune like to theirs
 Whom the Gods love, all this He spake to me
 As pæan-hymn, and made my heart full glad:
 And I full fondly trusted Phœbos' lips
 As holy and from falsehood free, of art
 Oracular an ever-flowing spring,
 And He who sang this, He who at the feast
 Being present, spake these things,—yea, He it is
 That slew my son.


                                  267

 The man who does ill, ill must suffer too.


                                  268

 Evil on mortals comes full swift of foot,
 And guilt on him who doth the right transgress.


                                  269

 Thou see'st a vengeance voiceless and unseen
 For one who sleeps or walks or sits at ease:
 It takes its course obliquely, here to-day,
 And there to-morrow. Nor does night conceal
 Men's deeds of ill, but whatsoe'er thou dost,
 Think that some God beholds it.


                                  270

 “All have their chance:” good proverb for the rich.


                                  271

 Wise is the man who knows what profiteth,
 Not he who knoweth much.


                                  272

 Full grievous burden is a prosperous fool.


                                  272A

 From a just fraud God turneth not away.


                                  273

 There is a time when God doth falsehood prize.


                                  274

 The polished brass is mirror of the form,
 Wine of the soul.


                                  275

 Words are the parents of a causeless wrath.


                                  276

 Men credit gain for oaths, not oaths for them.


                                  277

 God ever works with those that work with will.


                                  278

 Wisdom to learn is e'en for old men good.


                                  281

 The base who prosper are intolerable.


                                  282

 The seed of mortals broods o'er passing things,
 And hath nought surer than the smoke-cloud's shadow.


                                  283

 Old age hath stronger sense of right than youth.


                                  286

 Yet though a man gets many wounds in breast,
 He dieth not, unless the appointed time,
 The limit of his life's span, coincide;
 Nor does the man who by the hearth at home
 Sits still, escape the doom that Fate decrees.


                                  287

 How far from just the hate men bear to death,
 Which comes as safeguard against many ills.


                                  288

                              _To_ FORTUNE

 Thou did'st beget me; thou too, as it seems,
 Wilt now destroy me.


                                  289

 The fire-moth's silly death is that I fear.


                                  290

 I by experience know the race full well
 That dwells in Æthiop land, where seven-mouthed Nile
 Rolls o'er the land with winds that bring the rain,
 What time the fiery sun upon the earth
 Pours its hot rays, and melts the snow till then
 Hard as the rocks; and all the fertile soil
 Of Egypt, filled with that pure-flowing stream,
 Brings forth Demêter's ears that feed our life.


                                  291

 This hoopoo, witness of its own dire ills,
 He hath in varied garb set forth, and shows
 In full array that bold bird of the rocks
 Which, when the spring first comes, unfurls a wing
 Like that of white-plumed kite; for on one breast
 It shows two forms, its own and eke its child's,
 And when the corn grows gold, in autumn's prime,
 A dappled plumage all its form will clothe;
 And ever in its hate of these 'twill go
 Far off to lonely thickets or bare rocks.


                                  292

 Still to the sufferer comes, as due from God,
 A glory that to suffering owes its birth.


                                  293

 The air is Zeus, Zeus earth, and Zeus the heaven,
 Zeus all that is, and what transcends them all.


                                  294

 Take courage; pain's extremity soon ends.


                                  298

 When Strength and Justice are true yoke-fellows,
 Where can be found a mightier pair than they?




                            RHYMED CHORUSES


                               AGAMEMNON


                             VERSES 40-248

     Nine weary years are gone and spent
     Since Menelaos' armament
     Sped forth, on work of vengeance bent,
             For Priam's guilty land;
     And with him Agamemnon there
     Throne, sceptre, army all did share;
     And so from Zeus the Atreidæ bear,
             Their twofold high command.
     They a fleet of thousand sail,
     Strong in battle to prevail,
     Led from out our Argive coast,
     Shouting war-cries to the host;
     E'en as vultures do that utter
     Shrillest screams as round they flutter,
     Grieving for their nestlings lost,
     Plying still their oary wings
     In many lonely wanderings,
     Robbed of all the sweet unrest
     That bound them to their young ones' nest.
     And One on high of solemn state,
     Apollo, Pan, or Zeus the great,
     When he hears that shrill wild cry
     Of his clients in the sky,
     On them, the godless who offend,
     Erinnys slow and sure doth send.
     So 'gainst Alexandros then
     The sons of Atreus, chiefs of men,
     Zeus sent to work his high behest,
     True guardian of the host and guest.
     He, for bride of many a groom,
     On Danai, Troïans sendeth doom,
     Many wrestlings, sinew-trying
     Of the knee in dust down-lying,
     Many a spear-shaft snapt asunder
     In the prelude of war's thunder.
     What shall be, shall, and still we see
     Fulfilled is destiny's decree.
     Nor by tears in secret shed,
     Nor by offerings o'er the dead,
     Will he soothe God's vengeful ire
     For altar hearths despoiled of fire.

     And we with age outworn and spent
     Are left behind that armament,
     With head upon our staff low bent.
     Weak our strength like that of boy;
     Youth's life-blood, in its bounding joy,
     For deeds of might is like to age,
     And knows not yet war's heritage:
     And the man whom many a year
     Hath bowed in withered age and sere,
     As with three feet creepeth on,
     Like phantom form of day-dream gone
     Not stronger than his infant son.

     And now, O Queen, who tak'st thy name
     From Tyndareus of ancient fame,
     Our Clytæmnestra whom we own
     As rightly sharing Argos' throne!
     What tidings joyous hast thou heard,
     Token true or flattering word,
     That thou send'st to every shrine
     Solemn pomp in stately line,—
     Shrines of Gods who reign in light,
     Or those who dwell in central night,
     Who in Heaven for aye abide,
     Or o'er the Agora preside.
     Lo, thy gifts on altars blaze,
     And here and there through heaven's wide ways
     The torches fling their fiery rays,
     Fed by soft and suasive spell
     Of the clear oil, flowing well
     From the royal treasure-cell.
     Telling what of this thou may,
     All that's meet to us to say,
     Do thou our haunting cares allay,
     Cares which now bring sore distress,
     While now bright hope, with power to bless,
     From out the sacrifice appears,
     And wardeth off our restless fears,
     The boding sense of coming fate,
     That makes the spirit desolate.


                               STROPHE I

         Yes, it is mine to tell
 What omens to our leaders then befell,
         Giving new strength for war,
         (For still though travelled far
 In life, by God's great gift to us belong
         The suasive powers of song,)
         To tell how those who bear
 O'er all Achæans sway in equal share,
         Ruling in one accord
 The youth of Hellas that own each as lord,
         Were sent with mighty host
 By mighty birds against the Troïan coast,
 Kings of the air to kings of men appearing
 Near to the palace, on the right hand veering;
         On spot seen far and near,
         They with their talons tear
 A pregnant hare with all her unborn young,
 All her life's course in death's deep darkness flung.
 Oh raise the bitter cry, the bitter wail;
         Yet pray that good prevail!


                             ANTISTROPHE I

         And then the host's wise seer
 Stood gazing on the Atreidæ standing near,
         Of diverse mood, and knew
         Those who the poor hare slew,
 And those who led the host with shield and spear,
         And spake his omens clear:
         “One day this host shall go,
 And Priam's city in the dust lay low,
         And all the kine and sheep
 Countless, which they before their high towers keep,
         Fate shall with might destroy:
 Only take heed that no curse mar your joy,
 Nor blunt the edge of curb that Troïa waiteth,
 Smitten too soon, for Artemis still hateth
         The wingèd hounds that own
         Her father on his throne,
 Who slay the mother with the young unborn,
 And looks upon the eagle's feast with scorn.
 Ah! raise the bitter cry, the bitter wail;
         Yet pray that good prevail.


                                 EPODE

 For she, the Fair One, though her mercy shields
   The lion's whelps, like dew-drops newly shed,
 And yeanling young of beasts that roam the fields,
   Yet prays her sire fulfil these omens dread,
         The good, the evil too.
 And now I call on him, our Healer true,
 Lest she upon the Danai send delays
 That keep our ships through many weary days,
         Urging a new strange rite,
 Unblest alike by man and God's high law,
 Evil close clinging, working sore despite,
         Marring a wife's true awe.
         For still there lies in wait,
         Fearful and ever new,
 Watching the hour its eager thirst to sate,
 Vengeance on those who helpless infants slew.”
 Such things, ill mixed with good, great Calchas spake,
 As destined by the birds' strange auguries;
 And we too now our echoing answer make
         In loud and woeful cries:
 Oh raise the bitter cry, the bitter wail;
         Yet pray that good prevail.


                               STROPHE II

         O Zeus, whoe'er Thou be,
         If that name please thee well,
         By that I call on Thee;
 For weighing all things else I fail to tell
         Of any name but Zeus;
         If once for all I seek
 Of all my haunting, troubled thoughts a truce,
         That name I still must speak.


                             ANTISTROPHE II

         For He who once was great,
         Full of the might to war,
         Hath lost his high estate;
 And He who followed now is driven afar,
         Meeting his Master too:
         But if one humbly pay
 With 'bated breath to Zeus his honour due,
         He walks in wisdom's way,—


                              STROPHE III

 To Zeus, who men in wisdom's path doth train,
         Who to our mortal race
 Hath given the fixèd law that pain is gain;
         For still through his high grace
 True counsel falleth on the heart like dew,
         In deep sleep of the night,
 The boding thoughts that out of ill deeds grew;
 This too They work who sit enthronèd in their might.


                            ANTISTROPHE III

 And then the elder leader of great fame
         Who ruled the Achæans' ships,
 Not bold enough a holy seer to blame
         With words from reckless lips,
 But tempered to the fate that on him fell;—
         And when the host was vexed
 With tarryings long, scant stores, and surging swell,
 Chalkis still far off seen, and baffled hopes perplexed;


                               STROPHE IV

 And stormy blasts that down from Strymon sweep,
 And breed sore famine with the long delay,
 Hurl forth our men upon the homeless deep
         On many a wandering way,
 Sparing nor ships, nor ropes, nor sailing gear,
 Doubling the weary months, and vexing still
         The Argive host with fear.
 Then when as mightier charm for that dread ill,
         Hard for our ships to bear,
 From the seer's lips did “Artemis” resound,
 The Atreidæ smote their staves upon the ground,
 And with no power to check, shed many a bitter tear.


                             ANTISTROPHE IV

 And then the elder of the chiefs thus cried:
 “Great woe it is the Gods to disobey;
 Great woe if I my child, my home's fond pride,
         With my own hands must slay,
 Polluting with the streams of maiden's blood
 A father's hands, the holy altar near.
         Which course hath least of good?
 How can I loss of ships and comrades bear?
         Right well may men desire,
 With craving strong, the blood of maiden pure
 As charm to lull the winds and calm ensure;
 Ah, may there come the good to which our hopes aspire!”


                               STROPHE V

     Then, when he his spirit proud
     To the yoke of doom had bowed,
     While the blasts of altered mood
     O'er his soul swept like a flood,
     Reckless, godless and unblest;
     Thence new thoughts upon him pressed,
     Thoughts of evil, frenzied daring,
     (Still doth passion, base guile sharing,
     Mother of all evil, hold
     The power to make men bad and bold,)
     And he brought himself to slay
     His daughter, as on solemn day,
     Victim slain the ship to save,
     When for false wife fought the brave.


                             ANTISTROPHE V

     All her cries and loud acclaim,
     Calling on her father's name,—
     All her beauty fresh and fair,
     They heeded not in their despair,
     Their eager lust for conflict there.
     And her sire the attendants bade
     To lift her, when the prayer was said,
     Above the altar like a kid,
     Her face and form in thick veil hid;
     Yea, with ruthless heart and bold,
     O'er her gracious lips to hold
     Their watch, and with the gag's dumb pain
     From evil-boding words restrain.


                               STROPHE VI

         And then upon the ground
 Pouring the golden streams of saffron veil,
         She cast a glance around
         That told its piteous tale,
 At each of those who stood prepared to slay,
   Fair as the form by skilful artist drawn,
 And wishing, all in vain, her thoughts to say;
   For oft of old in maiden youth's first dawn,
         Within her father's hall,
         Her voice to song did call,
 To chant the praises of her sire's high state,
 His fame, thrice blest of Heaven, to celebrate.
         What then ensued mine eyes
 Saw not, nor may I tell, but not in vain
         The arts of Calchas wise;
         For justice sends again,
 The lesson “pain is gain” for them to learn:
   But for our piteous fate since help is none,
 With voice that bids “Good-bye,” we from it turn
   Ere yet it come, and this is all as one
         With weeping ere the hour,
         For soon will come in power
 To-morrow's dawn, and good luck with it come!
 So speaks the guardian of this Apian home.


                             VERSES 346-471

     O great and sovran Zeus, O Night,
     Great in glory, great in might,
     Who round Troïa's towers hast set,
     Enclosing all, thy close-meshed net,
     So that neither small nor great
     Can o'erleap the bondslave's fate,
     Or woe that maketh desolate;
     Zeus, the God of host and guest,
     Worker of all this confessed,
     He by me shall still be blest.
     Long since, 'gainst Alexandros He
     Took aim with bow that none may flee,
     That so his arrows onward driven,
     Nor miss their mark, nor pierce the heaven.


                               STROPHE I

         Yes, they lie smitten low,
 If so one dare to speak, by stroke of Zeus;
         Well one may trace the blow;
 The doom that He decreed their soul subdues.
         And though there be that say
 The Gods for mortal men care not at all,
 Though they with reckless feet tread holiest way,
         These none will godly call.
 Now is it to the children's children clear
         Of those who, overbold,
 More than was meet, breathed Discord's spirit drear;
 While yet their houses all rich store did hold
         Beyond the perfect mean.
 Ah! may my lot be free from all that harms,
         My soul may nothing wean
 From calm contentment with her tranquil charms;
         For nought is there in wealth
 That serves as bulwark 'gainst the subtle stealth
         Of Destiny and Doom,
 For one who, in the pride of wanton mood,
 Spurns the great altar of the Right and Good.


                             ANTISTROPHE I

         Yea, a strange impulse wild
 Urges him on, resistless in its might,
         Atè's far-scheming child.
 It knows no healing, is not hid in night,
         That mischief lurid, dark;
 Like bronze that will not stand the test of wear,
 A tarnished blackness in its hue we mark;
 And like a boy who doth a bird pursue
         Swift-floating on the wing,
 He to his country hopeless woe doth bring;
         And no God hears their prayer,
 But sendeth down the unrighteous to despair,
         Whose hands are stained with sin.
         So was it Paris came
 His entrance to the Atreidæ's home to win,
         And brought its queen to shame,
 To shame that brand indelible hath set
 Upon the board where host and guest were met.


                               STROPHE II

 And leaving to her countrymen to bear
 Wild whirl of ships of war and shield and spear,
         And bringing as her dower,
         Death's doom to Ilion's tower,
 She hath passed quickly through the palace gate,
         Daring what none should dare;
 And lo! the minstrel seers bewail the fate
         That home must henceforth share;
 “Woe for the kingly house and for its lord;
 Woe for the marriage-bed and paths which still
         A vanished love doth fill!
 There stands he, wronged, yet speaking not a word
         Of scorn from wrathful will,
 Seeing with utter woe that he is left,
         Of her fair form bereft;
         And in his yearning love
 For her who now is far beyond the sea,
 A phantom queen through all the house shall rove;
         And all the joy doth flee
 The sculptured forms of beauty once did give;
 And in the penury of eyes that live,
         All Aphroditè's grace
         Is lost in empty space.


                             ANTISTROPHE II

 And spectral forms in visions of the night
 Come, bringing sorrow with their vain delight:
         For vain it is when one
         Thinks that great joy is near,
 And, passing through his hands, the dream is gone
         On gliding wings, that bear
 The vision far away on paths of sleep.”
         Such woes were felt at home
 Upon the sacred altar of the hearth,
 And worse than these remain for those who roam
         From Hellas' parent earth:
 In every house, in number measureless,
         Is seen a sore distress:
         Yea, sorrows pierce the heart:
 For those who from his home he saw depart
         Each knoweth all too well;
 And now, instead of warrior's living frame,
 There cometh to the home where each did dwell
 The scanty ashes, relics of the flame,
         The urns of bronze that keep
         The dust of those that sleep.


                              STROPHE III

 For Ares, who from bodies of the slain
         Reapeth a golden gain,
 And holdeth, like a trafficker, his scales,
 E'en where the torrent rush of war prevails,
         From Ilion homeward sends
 But little dust, yet burden sore for friends,
 O'er which, smooth-lying in the brazen urn,
         They sadly weep and mourn,
 Now for this man as foremost in the strife,
 And now for that who in the battle fell,
         Slain for another's wife.
 And muttered curses some in secret tell,
         And jealous discontent
 Against the Atreidæ who as champions led
         The mighty armament;
 And some around the wall, the goodly dead,
 Have there in alien land their monument,
         And in the soil of foes
 Take in the sleep of death their last repose.


                            ANTISTROPHE III

 And lo! the murmurs which our country fill
         Are as a solemn curse,
 And boding anxious fear expecteth still
         To hear of evil worse.
 Not blind the Gods, but giving fullest heed
 To those who cause a nation's wounds to bleed;
 And the dark-robed Erinnyes in due time
         By adverse chance and change
 Plunge him who prospers though defiled by crime
 In deepest gloom, and through its formless range
         No gleams of help appear.
 O'er-vaunted glory is a perilous thing;
 For on it Zeus, whose glance fills all with fear,
         His thunderbolts doth fling.
         That fortune fair I praise
 That rouseth not the Gods to jealousy.
 May I ne'er tread the devastator's ways,
         Nor as a prisoner see
 My life wear out in drear captivity!


                                 EPODE

 And now at bidding of the courier-flame,
         Herald of great good news,
 A murmur swift through all the city came;
 But whether it with truth its course pursues,
 Who knows? or whether God who dwells on high,
         With it hath sent a lie?
 Who is so childish, or of sense bereft,
         As first to feel the glow
 That message of the herald fire has left,
         And then to sink down low,
 Because the rumour changes in its sound?
         It is a woman's mood
 To accept a boon before the truth is found:
 Too quickly she believes in tidings good,
         And so the line exact
         That marks the truth of fact
 Is over-passed, and with quick doom of death
 A rumour spread by woman perisheth.


                             VERSES 665-782

                               STROPHE I

 Who was it named her with such foresight clear?
         Could it be One of might,
 In strange prevision of her work of fear,
         Guiding the tongue aright?
 Who gave that war-wed, strife-upstirring one
         The name of Helen, ominous of ill?
 For 'twas through her that Hellas was undone,
         That woes from Hell men, ships, and cities fill.
 Out from the curtains, gorgeous in their fold,
 Wafted by breeze of Zephyr, earth's strong child,
         She her swift way doth hold;
 And hosts of mighty men, as hunters bold
         That bear the spear and shield,
 Wait on the track of those who steered their way
 Unseen where Simois flows by leafy field,
 Urged by a strife that came with power to slay.


                             ANTISTROPHE I

 And so the wrath which doth its work fulfil
         To Ilion brought, well-named,
 A marriage marring all, avenging still
         For friendship wronged and shamed,
 And outrage foul on Zeus, of host and guest
   The guardian God, from those who then did raise
 The bridal hymn of marriage-feast unblest
   Which called the bridegroom's kin to shouts of praise.
         But now by woe oppressed
 Priam's ancient city waileth very sore,
 And calls on Paris unto dark doom wed,
       Suffering yet more and more
 For all the blood of heroes vainly shed,
 And bearing through the long protracted years
 A life of wailing grief and bitter tears.


                               STROPHE II

         One was there who did rear
 A lion's whelp within his home to dwell,
         A monster waking fear,
 Weaned from the mother's milk it loved so well:
         Then in life's dawning light,
 Loved by the children, petted by the old,
         Oft in his arms clasped tight,
 As one an infant newly-born would hold,
 With eye that gleamed beneath the fondling hand,
 And fawning as at hunger's strong command.


                             ANTISTROPHE II

         But soon of age full grown,
 It showed the inbred nature of its sire,
         And wrought unasked, alone,
 A feast to be that fostering nurture's hire;
         Gorged full with slaughtered sheep,
 The house was stained with blood as with a curse
         No slaves away could keep,
 A murderous mischief waxing worse and worse,
 Sent as from God a priest from Atè fell,
 And reared within the man's own house to dwell.


                              STROPHE III

 So I would say to Ilion then there came
   Mood as of calm when every wind is still,
 The gentle pride and joy of noble fame,
 The eye's soft glance that all the soul doth thrill;
         Love's full-blown flower that brings
         The thorn that wounds and stings;
         And yet she turned aside,
 And of the marriage feast wrought bitter end,
 Coming to dwell where Priam's sons abide,
         Ill sojourner, ill friend,
 Sent by great Zeus, the God of host and guest,
 A true Erinnys, by all wives unblest.


                            ANTISTROPHE III

 There lives a saying framed of ancient days,
   And in men's minds imprinted firm and fast,
 That great good fortune never childless stays,
   But brings forth issue,—that on fame at last
         There rushes on apace
         Great woe for all the race;
         But I, apart, alone,
 Hold a far other and a worthier creed:
 The impious act is by ill issue known,
         Most like the parent deed;
 While still for all who love the Truth and Right,
 Good fortune prospers, fairer and more bright.


                               STROPHE IV

 But wanton Outrage done in days of old
   Another wanton Outrage still doth bear,
 And mocks at human woes with scorn o'erbold,
   Or soon or late as they their fortune share.
         That other in its turn
         Begets Satiety,
 And lawless Might that doth all hindrance spurn,
         And sacred right defy,
 Two Atès fell within their dwelling-place,
         Like to their parent race.


                             ANTISTROPHE IV

 Yet Justice still shines bright in dwellings murk
   And dim with smoke, and honours calm content;
 But gold-bespangled homes, where guilt doth lurk,
   She leaves with glance in horror backward bent,
         And draws with reverent fear
         To places holier far,
 And little recks the praise the prosperous hear,
         Whose glories tarnished are;
 But still towards its destined goal she brings
         The whole wide course of things.

       Say then, son of Atreus, thou
       Who com'st as Troïa's conqueror now,
 What form of welcome right and meet,
 What homage thy approach to greet,
 Shall I now use in measure true,
 Nor more nor less than that is due?
 Many men there are, I wis,
 Who in seeming place their bliss,
 Caring less for that which is.
 If one suffers, then their wail
 Loudly doth the ear assail;
 Yet have they nor lot nor part
 In the grief that stirs the heart;
 So too the joyous men will greet
 With smileless faces counterfeit:
 But shepherd who his own sheep knows
 Will scan the lips that fawn and gloze,
 Ready still to praise and bless
 With weak and watery kindliness.
 Thou when thou the host did'st guide
 For Helen—truth I will not hide—
 In mine eyes had'st features grim,
 Such as unskilled art doth limn,
 Not guiding well the helm of thought,
 And giving souls with grief o'erwrought
 False courage from fresh victims brought,
 But with nought of surface zeal,
 Now full glad of heart I feel,
 And hail thy acts as deeds well done:
 Thou too in time shall know each one,
 And learn who wrongly, who aright
 In house or city dwells in might.


                            VERSES 947-1001

                               STROPHE I

         Why thus continually
 Do ever-haunting phantoms hover nigh
         My hearth that bodeth ill?
 Why doth the prophet's strain unbidden still,
         Unbought, flow on and on?
         Why on my mind's dear throne
 Hath faith lost all her former power to fling
 That terror from me as an idle thing?
 Yet since the ropes were fastened in the sand
         That moored the ships to land,
 When the great naval host to Ilion went,
 Time hath passed on to feeble age and spent.


                             ANTISTROPHE I

         And now as face to face,
 Myself reporting to myself I trace
         Their safe return; and yet
 My mind, taught by itself, cannot forget
         Erinnys' dolorous cry,
         That lyreless melody,
   And hath no strength of wonted confidence.
   Not vain these pulses of the inward sense,
   As my heart beateth in its wild unrest,
           Within true-boding breast;
   And hoping against hope, I yet will pray
   My fears may all prove false and pass away.


                               STROPHE II

           Of high, o'erflowing health
   There is no limit found that satisfies;
         For soon by force or stealth,
   As foe 'gainst whom but one poor wall doth rise,
   Disease upon it presses, and the lot
   Of fair good fortune onward moves until
   It strikes on unseen reef where help is not.
           But should fear move their will
           For safety of their freight,
 With measured sling a part they sacrifice,
         And so avert their fate,
 Lest the whole house should sink no more to rise,
         O'erwhelmed with misery;
 Nor does the good ship perish utterly:
         So too abundant gift,
 From Zeus in double plenty, from the earth,
 Doth the worn soul from anxious care uplift,
 And turns the famished wail to bounding joy and mirth.


                             ANTISTROPHE II

         But blood that once is shed
 In purple stream of death upon the ground,
         Who then, when life is fled,
 A charm to call it back again hath found?
   Else against him who raised the dead to life
 Zeus had not sternly warred, as warning given
   To all men; but if Fate were not at strife
         With Fate that brings from Heaven
         Help from the Gods, my heart,
 Out-stripping speech, had given thought free vent.
         But now in gloom apart
 It sits and moans in sullen discontent,
         And hath no hope that e'er
 It shall an issue seasonably fair
         From out the tangled skein
 Of life's strange course unravel straight and clear,
 While in the fever of continuing pain
 My soul doth burden sore of troublous anguish bear.




                          THE LIBATION-POURERS


                              VERSES 20-75


                               STROPHE I

 Lo, from the palace door
 We wend our way to pour
       Gifts on the dead;
 And in our bitter woe,
 Our hands with many a blow
       Smite breast and head.
 On each fair cheek the nail
 Has ploughed full many a trail,
 And all to tatters torn
 The garments we have worn;
 The foldings of the vest
 O'er maiden's swelling breast
     Are roughly rent;
 For now on us the chance
 That shuts out joy and dance
       Our fate hath sent.


                             ANTISTROPHE I

 A spectral vision clear
 Thrills every hair with fear,
 In haunted sleep,
 Breathing of dire distress,
 From innermost recess
 Its watch doth keep,
 Breaking with cry of fright
 The still deep hush of night:
 All through the queenly bower
 Sharp cry was heard that hour,
 And they to whom 'twas given
 To read decrees of Heaven,
         In dream o'er-true,
 By solemn pledges bound,
 Declared that underground
 The dead were wrathful found
         'Gainst those that slew.


                               STROPHE II

 And so the godless queen
 In eager haste is seen,—
 Sends me with gifts like this,
 Full graceless grace, I wis,
 As if (O mother Earth,
 To whom we owe our birth!)
         To banish dread.
 And I would fain delay
 This prayer of mine to pray:
 What ransom can men pay
         For blood once shed?
 Oh, hearth and home of woe!
 Oh, utter overthrow!
 Foul mists brood o'er our halls:
 No ray of sunlight falls;
 Thick darkness from the tomb
 Of heroes makes the gloom
         Yet more intense.


                             ANTISTROPHE II

 And awe that once we knew,
 Strong, mighty to subdue,
 Falling on every ear,
 Thrilling each soul with fear,
         Is gone far hence.
 There be that well may bow
 In craven terror now,
 For lo! Success enthroned
 As more than God is owned.
 But Vengeance will not fail
 Ere long to turn the scale.
 On some her strokes alight,
 While yet their day is bright;
 Some, as in twilight's gloom,
 O'erflow with gathering doom;
 Some endless night doth hold
 In realm of darkness old.


                              STROPHE III

 And for the blood which Earth,
 To whom it owed its birth,
 Hath drunk, there still doth wait
 A stern avenging Fate;
 The stain of blood doth stay,
 And will not pass away,
 And nerves are thrilled with pain
 In soul that sets in train
 The plague that works amain
         Its evil great.


                            ANTISTROPHE III

 All help from him hath fled
 Who with adulterous tread
 Denies another's bed.
 Though many streams should pour
 Their waters o'er and o'er,
 Those waters evermore
         Are poured in vain;
 They cannot cleanse the guilt
 Of blood that once is spilt,
         Man's hand to stain.


                                 EPODE

 But since to me by Heaven
 The exile's life is given,
 (Yea, far from home I know
 The bondslave's cup of woe,)
 I needs must yield assent
 To good or ill intent,
 Accepting their commands
 Who rule with sceptred hands,—
 Yea, I must hide my hate
 In this my evil fate,
 And under strong control
 Keep my rebellious soul;
 And now beneath my veil
 I weep my woes' full tale;
 For cares that vex and fret
 My cheeks with tears are wet.


                             VERSES 576-639

                               STROPHE I

 Many dread forms of woe and fear the Earth
     Doth breed; and Ocean's deep
 Is full of foes men hate, of monstrous birth;
 And Air's high pathways keep
 Their flashing meteors; birds that wing their flight,
     And things on earth that creep;
 And one might tell the wrath of whirlwind's might,
     When tempests wildly sweep.


                             ANTISTROPHE I

 But who can tell man's purpose overbold?
     Or woman's, prompt to dare?
 Or the strong loves that men in bondage hold,
     And bring woe everywhere?
 Or strange conjunctions of the hearth and home?
     But still the palm they bear,
 The loves unloved that women overcome,
     And hold dominion there.


                               STROPHE II

 And one whose thoughts are not o'erswift of wing,
     May learn and ponder well
 What purpose Thestios' child to act did bring,
     Purpose most dire and fell,
 Her burning thought who did her own child slay,
     Kindling the torch of death
 That with her child's life kept its equal way,
 Since coming from his mother's womb he cried,
 To that predestined day on which at last he died.


                             ANTISTROPHE II

 And yet another must I in my song
     Devote to hate and scorn,
 The murderess Skylla, who to deeds of wrong
     By Minos' gifts was borne,
 And for her foes' sake slew a man she loved
     For Cretan chains gold-wrought;
 She with dog's heart the deathless lock removed
 From him, in deep sleep sunk; yet Hermes' power
 She too was taught at last at her appointed hour.


                              STROPHE III

 But since I tell my tale of loathly crime,
 And of ill-omened marriage out of time,
     Wedlock our house abhors,
 The schemes and plots of women steeped in guile
 Against a warrior chief, a chief erewhile
         The dread of foes in wars,
 The foremost place I give to altar-hearth
 Where no wrath burns and woman knows the worth
         Of mood from daring free.


                            ANTISTROPHE III

 Yet of all ills the Lemnian first may stand,
 The cry of loathing rings through all the land,
         And still each crime of dread
 A man will liken to the Lemnian ill;
 And now by woe that comes from God's stern will
         The race is gone and fled,
 Of all men scorned, for no man looks with love
 On deeds that to the high Gods hateful prove;
         Is not this clear to see?


                               STROPHE IV

 And lo! the sword sharp-pointed pierces deep,
   E'en to the heart, the sword which Vengeance wields;
 The lawless deed will not neglected sleep,
   When men tread down what fear of high heaven shields;


                             ANTISTROPHE IV

 But still the block of Vengeance firm doth stand,
   And Fate, as swordsmith, hammers blow on blow;
 And then with thoughts that none can understand,
   Erinnys comes far known, though working slow,
 And to the old house brings the youthful heir,
   That deeds of blood wrought out of olden time
         May the due judgment bear
         For each polluting crime.


                             VERSES 769-820

                               STROPHE I

 Oh, hear me, hear my prayer, thou mighty Lord!
   Sire of all Gods that on Olympos dwell,
 Hear Thou, and grant my longing heart's desire,
   That those who wise of heart would fain do well
         May see each prayer for right
         Fulfilled in holiest might;
         That prayer, O Zeus, I pray.


                               STROPHE II

 Do Thou protect him, yea, O Zeus, and bring
   Before his foes on yonder secret way;
 For if thou raise him high, then Thou, O king,
         Shalt to thy heart's content
 Receive a twofold, threefold recompence,
         For that thine anger bent
         Against each old offence.


                             ANTISTROPHE I

 Look on the son of one whom Thou did'st love,
   Like orphan colt fast bound to car of woes;
 Set Thou a mark that may as limit prove;
   Ah, might one watch his footsteps as he goes,
         In measured course and true,
         This his own country through!


                              STROPHE III

         And ye who in our home
 Stand in the shrine with plenteous wealth full stored,
         Hear, O ye Gods, and come,
         Yea, come with one accord,
         Lead him on, wash away
 With vengeance new the blood of crime of old;
         Let not the old guilt stay
 To breed fresh offspring where our home we hold.


                                 MESODE

         But grant him good success,
 O Thou who dost within the great cave dwell!
 With upward glance of joy our chief's house bless,
         And that he too, full well,
 Freely and brightly with the dear, loved eyes,
 May look from out the veil of cloudy skies.


                            ANTISTROPHE III

         And then may Maia's son
 Assist him, as is meet, in this his task!
         Through Him success is won,
         The boon that now we ask:
 And many secret things will He make clear,
         If that should be His will;
 But should He choose the truth should not appear,
         Before men's eyes He still
 Brings darkness and the blackness of the night,
 Nor is He clearer in the day's full light.


                               STROPHE IV

         And then will we pour forth
 All that our house contains of costliest worth,
         Past evil to redeem,
 And through the city we will raise the strain
 Shrill-voiced of women's chant yet once again.
         All this as good I deem;
 This, this my gain increaseth more and more,
 And far from those I love is sorrow's bitter stour.


                             ANTISTROPHE II

 But thou, take courage when the time is come,
         The time to act indeed,
 And when she calls thee “child,” do thou strike home,
 And let thy father's name for vengeance plead;
 Do thy dread taskwork to the uttermost.


                             ANTISTROPHE IV

   Let Perseus' heart within thy bosom dwell,
 For thou dost work for each dear kindred ghost,
   And those on high, a bitter boon and fell,
         Completing there within
         The deed of blood and sin,
 And utterly destroying him whose hand
         That crime of murder planned.




                               EUMENIDES


                             VERSES 297-374

 Come then, and let us dance in solemn strain;
 It is our will to chant our harsh refrain,
         And tell how this our band
 Works among men the tasks we take in hand.
 In righteous vengeance find we full delight;
 On him who putteth forth clean hands and pure
         No wrath from us doth light;
 Unhurt shall he through all his life endure;
 But whoso, as this man, hath evil wrought,
         And hides hands stained with blood,
 On him we come, with power prevailing fraught,
         True witnesses and good,
 For those whom he has slain, and bent to win
 Full forfeit-price for that his deed of sin.


                               STROPHE I

         O Mother, Mother Night!
 Who did'st bear me a penalty and curse
   To those who see and those who see not light,
 Hear thou; for Leto's son, in mood perverse,
         Puts me to foulest shame,
 In that he robs me of my trembling prey,
         The victim whom we claim,
 That we his mother's blood may wash away;
         And over him as slain
 Sing we this dolorous, frenzied, maddening strain,
 The song that we, the Erinnyes, love so well,
 That binds the soul as with enchanter's spell,
 Without one note from out the sweet-voiced lyre,
 Withering the strength of men as with a blast of fire.


                             ANTISTROPHE I

         For this our task hath Fate
   Spun without fail to last for ever sure,
 That we on man weighed down with deeds of hate
   Should follow till the earth his life immure.
         Nor when he dies can he
         Boast of being truly free;
         And over him as slain
 Sing we this dolorous, frenzied, maddening strain,
 The song that we, the Erinnyes, love so well,
 That binds the soul as with enchanter's spell,
 Without one note from out the sweet-voiced lyre,
 Withering the strength of men as with a blast of fire.


                               STROPHE II

 Yea, at our birth this lot to us was given,
 And from the immortal Ones who dwell in Heaven
         We still must hold aloof;
 None sits with us at banquets of delight,
         Or shares a common roof,
 Nor part nor lot have I in garments white;
 My choice was made a race to overthrow,
 When murder, home-reared, lays a loved one low;
 Strong though he be, upon his track we tread,
 And drain his blood till all his strength is fled.


                             ANTISTROPHE II

 Yea, 'tis our work to set another free
   From tasks like this, and by my service due
 To give the Gods their perfect liberty,
   Relieved from task of meting judgment true;
 For this our tribe from out his fellowship
   Zeus hath cast out as worthy of all hate,
 And from our limbs the purple blood-drops drip;
 So with a mighty leap and grievous weight
     My foot I bring upon my quivering prey,
     With power to make the swift and strong give way,
 An evil and intolerable fate.


                              STROPHE III

 And all the glory and the pride of men,
 Though high exalted in the light of day,
         Wither and fade away,
         Of little honour then,
 When in the darkness of the grave they stay,
         By our attack brought low,
 The loathèd dance through which in raiment black we go:


                            ANTISTROPHE III

 And through the ill that leaves him dazed and blind,
 He still is all unconscious that he falls,
         So thick a cloud enthrals
         The vision of his mind:
 And Rumour with a voice of wailing calls,
         And tells of gathering gloom
 That doth the ancient halls in darkness thick entomb.


                               STROPHE IV

         So it abideth still;
 Ready and prompt are we to work our will,
         The dreaded Ones who bring
 The dire remembrance of each deed of ill,
   Whom mortals may not soothe with offering,
 Working a task with little honour fraught,
   Yea, all dishonoured, task the Gods detest,
         In sunless midnight wrought,
         By which alike are pressed
 Those who yet live, and those who lie in gloom unblest.


                             ANTISTROPHE IV

 What mortal man then will not crouch in fear,
         As he my work shall hear,
 The task to me by destiny from Heaven
         As from the high Gods given?
 Yea, a time-honoured lot is mine I trow,
         No shame in it I see,
 Though deep beneath the earth my station be,
 In gloom that never feels the sunlight's quickening glow.


                             VERSES 468-537

                               STROPHE I

 Now is there utter fall and overthrow,
         Which new-made laws begin;
 If he who struck the matricidal blow,
         His right—not so, his utter wrong shall win,
 This baseness will the minds of all men lead
         To wanton, reckless thought,
 And now for parents waits there woe, and deed
 Of parricidal guilt by children wrought.


                             ANTISTROPHE I

 For then no more shall wrath from this our band,
   The Mænad troop that watch the deeds of men,
 Come for these crimes; but lo! on either hand
   I will let slip all evil fate, and then,
         Telling his neighbours' grief,
 Shall this man seek from that, and seek in vain,
         Remission and relief,
 Nor is there any certain cure for pain.
 And lo! the wretched man all fruitlessly
         For grace and help shall cry.


                               STROPHE II

 Henceforth let no man in his anguish call,
 When he sore-smitten by ill-chance shall fall,
         Uttering with groan and moan,
 “O mighty Justice, O Erinnyes' throne!”
 So may a father or a mother wail,
 Struck by new woe, and tell their sorrow's tale;
         For low on earth doth lie
 The home where Justice once her dwelling had on high.


                             ANTISTROPHE II

 Yea, there are times when reverent Awe should stay
         As guardian of the soul;
 It profits much to learn through suffering
         The bliss of self-control.
 Who that within the heart's full daylight bears
         No touch of holy awe,
 Be it or man or State that casts out fear,
 Will still own reverence for the might of law?


                              STROPHE III

 Nor life that will no sovran rule obey,
 Nor one down-crushed beneath a despot's sway,
         Shalt thou approve;
 God still gives power and strength for victory
 To all that in the golden mean doth lie.
 All else, as they in diverse order move,
         He scans with watchful eye.
 With this I speak a word in harmony,
         That of irreverence still
         Outrage is offspring ill,
         While from the soul's true health
 Comes the much-loved, much-prayed-for joy and wealth.


                            ANTISTROPHE III

         Yes, this I bid thee know;
 Bow thou before the altar of the Right,
         And let no wandering glance
         That looks at gain askance
 Lead thee with godless foot to scorn or slight.
 Know well the appointed penalty shall come;
 The doom remaineth sure and will at last strike home.
 Wherefore let each man pay the reverence due
         To those who call him son;
 By each to thronging guests let honour true
         In loyal faith be done.


                               STROPHE IV

 But one who with no pressure of constraint
 Of his free will draws back from evil taint,
         He shall not be unblest,
 Nor ever sink by utter woe oppressed.
         But this I still aver,
 That he whose daring leads him to transgress,
 The chaos wild of evil deeds to stir,
         In sharp and sore distress,
         Against his will will slacken sail ere long,
 When, as his timbers crash before the blast,
         He feels the tempest strong.


                             ANTISTROPHE IV

 Then in the midst of peril he at last
 Shall call on those who then will hear him not.
         Yea, God still laughs to scorn
 The man by evil tide of passions borne,
         Swayed by thoughts wild and hot,
 When he beholdeth one whose boast was high
 He ne'er should know it, sunk in misery,
 And all unable round the point to steer;
   And so his former pride of prosperous days
 He wrecks upon the reefs of Vengeance drear,
   And dies with none to weep him or to praise.
