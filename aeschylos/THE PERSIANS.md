                       _Chorus of Persian Elders_


_ARGUMENT.—When Xerxes came to the throne of Persia, remembering how his
father Dareios had sought to subdue the land of the Hellenes, and
seeking to avenge the defeat of Datis and Artaphernes on the field of
Marathon, he gathered together a mighty host of all nations under his
dominion, and led them against Hellas. And at first he prospered and
prevailed, crossed the Hellespont, and defeated the Spartans at
Thermopylæ, and took the city of Athens, from which the greater part of
its citizens had fled. But at last he and his armament met with utter
overthrow at Salamis. Meanwhile Atossa, the mother of Xerxes, with her
handmaids and the elders of the Persians, waited anxiously at Susa,
where was the palace of the great king, for tidings of her son._

Footnote 2:

  _Note._—Within two years after the battle of Salamis, the feeling of
  natural exultation was met by Phrynichos in a tragedy bearing the
  title of _The Phœnikians_, and having for its subject the defeat of
  Xerxes. As he had come under the displeasure of the Athenian _demos_
  for having brought on the stage the sufferings of their Ionian kinsmen
  in his _Capture of Miletos_, he was apparently anxious to regain his
  popularity by a “sensation” drama of another kind; and his success
  seems to have prompted Æschylos to a like attempt five years later,
  B.C. 473. The Tetralogy to which the play belonged, and which gained
  the first prize on its representation, included the two tragedies
  (unconnected in subject) of _Phineus_ and _Glaucos_, and the satyric
  drama of _Prometheus the Fire-stealer_.

  The play has, therefore, the interest of being strictly a contemporary
  narrative of the battle of Salamis and its immediate consequences, by
  one who may himself have been present at it, and whose brother
  Ameinias (Herod, viii. 93) distinguished himself in it by a special
  act of heroism. As such, making all allowance for the influence of
  dramatic exigencies, and the tendency to colour history so as to meet
  the tastes of patriotic Athenians, it may claim, where it differs from
  the story told by Herodotos, to be a more trustworthy record. And it
  has, we must remember, the interest of being the only extant drama of
  its class, the only tragedy the subject of which is not taken from the
  cycle of heroic myths, but from the national history of the time. Far
  below the Oresteian Trilogy as it may seem to us as a work of art,
  having more the character of a spectacle than a poem, it was, we may
  well believe, unusually successful at the time, and it is said to have
  been chosen by Hiero for reproduction in Syracuse after Æschylos had
  settled there under his patronage.




                             THE PERSIANS


       SCENE.—SUSA, _in front of the palace of_ XERXES, _the tomb
          of_ DAREIOS _occupying the position of the thymele_

                   _Enter Chorus of_ Persian Elders.

 We the title bear of Faithful,[3]
 Friends of Persians gone to Hellas,
 Watchers left of treasure city,[4]
 Gold-abounding, whom, as oldest,
 Xerxes hath himself appointed,
 He, the offspring of Dareios,
 As the warders of his country.
 And about our king's returning,
 And our army's, gold-abounding,
 Over-much, and boding evil,                                          10
 Does my mind within me shudder
 (For our whole force, Asia's offspring,
 Now is gone), and for our young chief
 Sorely frets: nor courier cometh,
 Nor any horseman, bringing tidings
 To the city of the Persians.
 From Ecbatana departing,
 Susa, or the Kissian fortress,[5]
 Forth they sped upon their journey,
 Some in ships, and some on horses,
 Some on foot, still onward marching,
 In their close array presenting
 Squadrons duly armed for battle:                                     20
 Then Armistres, Artaphernes,
 Megabazes, and Astaspes,
 Mighty leaders of the Persians,
 Kings, and of the great King servants,[6]
 March, the chiefs of mighty army.
 Archers they and mounted horsemen.
 Dread to look on, fierce in battle,
 Artembares proud, on horseback,
 And Masistres, and Imæos,                                            30
 Archer famed, and Pharandakes,
 And the charioteer Sosthanes.
 Neilos mighty and prolific
 Sent forth others, Susikanes,
 Pegastagon, Egypt's offspring,
 And the chief of sacred Memphis;
 Great Arsames, Ariomardos,
 Ruler of primeval Thebæ,
 And the marsh-men,[7] and the rowers,
 Dread, and in their number countless.                                40
 And there follow crowds of Lydians,
 Very delicate and stately,[8]
 Who the people of the mainland
 Rule throughout—whom Mitragathes
 And brave Arkteus, kingly chieftains,
 Led, from Sardis, gold-abounding,
 Riding on their many chariots,
 Three or four a-breast their horses,
 Sight to look upon all dreadful.
 And the men of sacred Tmôlos[9]
 Rush to place the yoke of bondage
 On the neck of conquered Hellas.                                     50
 Mardon, Tharabis, spear-anvils,[10]
 And the Mysians, javelin-darting;[11]
 Babylôn too, gold-abounding,
 Sends a mingled cloud, swept onward,
 Both the troops who man the vessels,
 And the skilled and trustful bowmen;
 And the race the sword that beareth,
 Follows from each clime of Asia,
 At the great King's dread commandment.
 These, the bloom of Persia's greatness,
 Now are gone forth to the battle;                                    60
 And for these, their mother country,
 Asia, mourns with mighty yearning;
 Wives and mothers faint with trembling
 Through the hours that slowly linger,
 Counting each day as it passes.


                               STROPHE I

 The king's great host, destroying cities mighty,
 Hath to the land beyond the sea passed over,
 Crossing the straits of Athamantid Helle,[12]                        70
     On raft by ropes secured,
 And thrown his path, compact of many a vessel,
 As yoke upon the neck of mighty ocean.


                             ANTISTROPHE I

 Of populous Asia thus the mighty ruler
 'Gainst all the land his God-sent host directeth
 In two divisions, both by land and water,
     Trusting the chieftains stern,
 The men who drive the host to fight, relentless—
 He, sprung from gold-born race, a hero godlike.[13]                  80


                               STROPHE II

 Glancing with darkling look, and eyes as of ravening dragon,
 With many a hand, and many a ship, and Syrian chariot driving,[14]
 He upon spearmen renowned brings battle of conquering arrows.[15]


                             ANTISTROPHE II

 Yea, there is none so tried as, withstanding the flood of the mighty,90
 To keep within steadfast bounds that wave of ocean resistless;
 Hard to fight is the host of the Persians, the people stout-hearted.


                                 MESODE

 Yet ah! what mortal can ward the craft of the God all-deceiving?
 *Who, with a nimble foot, of one leap is easily sovereign?
 For Atè, fawning and kind, at first a mortal betraying,             100
 Then in snares and meshes decoys him,
 Whence one who is but man in vain doth struggle to 'scape from.


                              STROPHE III

 For Fate of old, by the high Gods' decree,
 Prevailed, and on the Persians laid this task,
     Wars with the crash of towers,
 And set the surge of horsemen in array,
 And the fierce sack that lays a city low.                           110


                            ANTISTROPHE III

 But now they learnt to look on ocean plains,[16]
 The wide sea hoary with the violent blast,
     Waxing o'er confident
 In cables formed of many a slender strand,
 And rare device of transport for the host.


                               STROPHE IV

     So now my soul is torn,
 As clad in mourning, in its sore affright,
 Ah me! ah me! for all the Persian host!                             120
     Lest soon our country learn
 That Susa's mighty fort is void of men.


                             ANTISTROPHE IV

     And through the Kissians' town
 Shall echo heavy thud of hands on breast.
 Woe! woe! when all the crowd of women speak
     This utterance of great grief,
 And byssine robes are rent in agony.


                               STROPHE V

     For all the horses strong,
     And host that march on foot,
 Like swarm of bees, have gone with him who led                      130
   The vanguard of the host.
 Crossing the sea-washed, bridge-built promontory
 That joins the shores of either continent.[17]


                             ANTISTROPHE V

   And beds with tears are wet
   In grief for husbands gone,
 And Persian wives are delicate in grief,
   Each yearning for her lord;
 And each who sent her warrior-spouse to battle                      140
 Now mourns at home in dreary solitude.
   But come, ye Persians now,
 And sitting in this ancient hall of ours,
 Let us take thought deep-counselling and wise,
   (Sore need is there of that,)
 How fareth now the great king Xerxes, he
   Who calls Dareios sire,
 Bearing the name our father bore of old?
 Is it the archers' bow that wins the day?
   Or does the strength prevail                                      150
 Of iron point that heads the spear's strong shaft?
 But lo! in glory like the face of gods,
 The mother of my king, my queen, appears:
 Let us do reverent homage at her feet;
   Yea, it is meet that all
 Should speak to her with words of greeting kind.

                 _Enter_ ATOSSA _in a chariot of state_

 _Chor._ O sovereign queen of Persian wives deep-zoned,
 Mother of Xerxes, reverend in thine age,
   Wife of Dareios! hail!
 'Twas thine to join in wedlock with a spouse
   Whom Persians owned as God,[18]
 And of a God thou art the mother too,
 Unless its ancient Fortune fails our host.                          160

 _Atoss._ Yes, thus I come, our gold-decked palace leaving,
 The bridal bower Dareios with me slept in.
 Care gnaws my heart, but now I tell you plainly
 A tale, my friends, which may not leave me fearless,
 Lest boastful wealth should stumble at the threshold,
 And with his foot o'erturn the prosperous fortune
 That great Dareios raised with Heaven's high blessing.
 And twofold care untold my bosom haunteth:
 We may not honour wealth that has no warriors,
 Nor on the poor shines light to strength proportioned;
 Wealth without stint we have, yet for our eye we tremble;           170
 For as the eye of home I deem a master's presence.
 Wherefore, ye Persians, aid me now in counsel;
 Trusty and old, in you lies hope of wisdom.

 _Chor._ Queen of our land! be sure thou need'st not utter
 Or thing or word twice o'er, which power may point to;
 Thou bid'st us counsel give who fain would serve thee.

 _Atoss._ Ever with many visions of the night[19]
 Am I encompassed, since my son went forth,
 Leading a mighty host, with aim to sack
 The land of the Ionians. But ne'er yet                              180
 Have I beheld a dream so manifest
 As in the night just past. And this I'll tell thee:
 There stood by me two women in fair robes;
 And this in Persian garments was arrayed,
 And that in Dorian came before mine eyes;
 In stature both of tallest, comeliest size;
 And both of faultless beauty, sisters twain
 Of the same stock.[20] And they twain had their homes,
 One in the Hellenic, one in alien land.
 And these two, as I dreamt I saw, were set                          190
 At variance with each other. And my son
 Learnt it, and checked and mollified their wrath,
 And yokes them to his chariot, and his collar
 He places on their necks. And one was proud
 Of that equipment,[21] and in harness gave
 Her mouth obedient; but the other kicked,
 And tears the chariot's trappings with her hands,
 And rushes off uncurbed, and breaks its yoke
 Asunder. And my son falls low, and then
 His father comes, Dareios, pitying him.
 And lo! when Xerxes sees him, he his clothes                        200
 Rends round his limbs. These things I say I saw
 In visions of the night; and when I rose,
 And dipped my hands in fountain flowing clear,[22]
 I at the altar stood with hand that bore
 Sweet incense, wishing holy chrism to pour
 To the averting Gods whom thus men worship.
 And I beheld an eagle in full flight
 To Phœbos' altar-hearth; and then, my friends,                      210
 I stood, struck dumb with fear; and next I saw
 A kite pursuing, in her wingèd course,
 And with his claws tearing the eagle's head,
 Which did nought else but crouch and yield itself.
 Such terrors it has been my lot to see,
 And yours to hear: For be ye sure, my son,
 If he succeed, will wonder-worthy prove;
 But if he fail, still irresponsible
 He to the people, and in either case,
 He, should he but return, is sovereign still.[23]

 _Chor._ We neither wish, O Lady, thee to frighten
 O'ermuch with what we say, nor yet encourage:
 But thou, the Gods adoring with entreaties,
 If thou hast seen aught ill, bid them avert it,
 And that all good things may receive fulfilment
 For thee, thy children, and thy friends and country.                220
 And next 'tis meet libations due to offer
 To Earth and to the dead. And ask thy husband,
 Dareios, whom thou say'st by night thou sawest,
 With kindly mood from 'neath the Earth to send thee
 Good things to light for thee and for thine offspring,
 While adverse things shall fade away in darkness.
 Such things do I, a self-taught seer, advise thee
 In kindly mood, and any way we reckon
 That good will come to thee from out these omens.

 _Atoss._ Well, with kind heart, hast thou, as first expounder,
 Out of my dreams brought out a welcome meaning
 For me, and for my sons; and thy good wishes,
 May they receive fulfilment! And this also,
 As thou dost bid, we to the Gods will offer                         230
 And to our friends below, when we go homeward.
 But first, my friends, I wish to hear of Athens,
 Where in the world do men report it standeth?[24]

 _Chor._ Far to the West, where sets our king the Sun-God.

 _Atoss._ Was it this city my son wished to capture?

 _Chor._ Aye, then would Hellas to our king be subject.

 _Atoss._ And have they any multitude of soldiers?

 _Chor._ A mighty host, that wrought the Medes much mischief.

 _Atoss._ And what besides? Have they too wealth sufficing?

 _Chor._ A fount of silver have they, their land's treasure.[25]240

 _Atoss._ Have they a host in archers' skill excelling?

 _Chor._ Not so, they wield the spear and shield and bucklers.[26]

 _Atoss._ What shepherd rules and lords it o'er their people?

 _Chor._ Of no man are they called the slaves or subjects.

 _Atoss._ How then can they sustain a foe invading?

 _Chor._ So that they spoiled Dareios' goodly army.

 _Atoss._ Dread news is thine for sires of those who're marching.

 _Chor._ Nay, but I think thou soon wilt know the whole truth;
 This running one may know is that of Persian:[27]
 For good or evil some clear news he bringeth.                       250

                           _Enter_ Messenger

 _Mess._ O cities of the whole wide land of Asia!
 O soil of Persia, haven of great wealth!
 How at one stroke is brought to nothingness
 Our great prosperity, and all the flower
 Of Persia's strength is fallen! Woe is me!
 'Tis ill to be the first to bring ill news;
 Yet needs must I the whole woe tell, ye Persians:
 All our barbaric mighty host is lost.[28]


                               STROPHE I

 _Chor._ O piteous, piteous woe!                              260
       O strange and dread event!
 Weep, O ye Persians, hearing this great grief!

 _Mess._ Yea, all things there are ruined utterly;
 And I myself beyond all hopes behold
       The light of day at home.


                             ANTISTROPHE I

 _Chor._ O'er-long doth life appear
       To me, bowed down with years,
 On hearing this unlooked-for misery.

 _Mess._ And I, indeed, being present and not hearing
 The tales of others, can report, ye Persians,
       What ills were brought to pass.


                               STROPHE II

 _Chor._ Alas, alas! in vain
 The many-weaponed and commingled host                               270
 Went from the land of Asia to invade
       The soil divine of Hellas.

 _Mess._ Full of the dead, slain foully, are the coasts
 Of Salamis, and all the neighbouring shore.


                             ANTISTROPHE II

 _Chor._ Alas, alas! sea-tossed
 The bodies of our friends, and much disstained:
 Thou say'st that they are drifted to and fro
       *In far out-floating garments.[29]

 _Mess._ E'en so; our bows availed not, but the host
 Has perished, conquered by the clash of ships.


                              STROPHE III

 _Chor._ Wail, raise a bitter cry                             280
 And full of woe, for those who died in fight.
 How every way the Gods have wrought out ill,
 Ah me! ah me, our army all destroyed.

 _Mess._ O name of Salamis that most I loathe!
 Ah, how I groan, remembering Athens too!


                            ANTISTROPHE III

 _Chor._ Yea, to her enemies
 Athens may well be hateful, and our minds
 Remember how full many a Persian wife                               290
 She, for no cause, made widows and bereaved.

 _Atoss._ Long time I have been silent in my woe,
 Crushed down with grief; for this calamity
 Exceeds all power to tell the woe, or ask.
 Yet still we mortals needs must bear the griefs
 The Gods send on us. Clearly tell thy tale,
 Unfolding the whole mischief, even though
 Thou groan'st at evils, who there is not dead,
 And which of our chief captains we must mourn,
 And who, being set in office o'er the host,
 Left by their death their office desolate.                          300

 _Mess._ Xerxes still lives and sees the light of day.

 _Atoss._ To my house, then, great light thy words have brought,
 Bright dawn of morning after murky night.

 _Mess._ Artembares, the lord of myriad horse,
 On the hard flinty coasts of the Sileni
 Is now being dashed; and valiant Dadakes,
 Captain of thousands, smitten with the spear,
 Leapt wildly from his ship. And Tenagon,
 Best of the true old Bactrians, haunts the soil
 Of Aias' isle; Lilaios, Arsames,                                    310
 And with them too Argestes, there defeated,
 Hard by the island where the doves abound,[30]
 Beat here and there upon the rocky shore.
 [And from the springs of Neilos, Ægypt's stream,
 Arkteus, Adeues, Pheresseues too,
 These with Pharnuchos in one ship were lost;]
 Matallos, Chrysa-born, the captain bold
 Of myriads, leader he of swarthy horse
 Some thrice ten thousand strong, has fallen low,
 His red beard, hanging all its shaggy length,
 Deep dyed with blood, and purpled all his skin.
 Arabian Magos, Bactrian Artames,                                    320
 They perished, settlers in a land full rough.
 [Amistris and Amphistreus, guiding well
 The spear of many a conflict, and the noble
 Ariomardos, leaving bitter grief
 For Sardis; and the Mysian Seisames.]
 With twelve score ships and ten came Tharybis;
 Lyrnæan he in birth, once fair in form,
 He lies, poor wretch, a death inglorious dying:
 And, first in valour proved, Syennesis,
 Kilikian satrap, who, for one man, gave
 Most trouble to his foes, and nobly died.                           330
 Of leaders such as these I mention make,
 And out of many evils tell but few.

 _Atoss._ Woe, woe! I hear the very worst of ills,
 Shame to the Persians, cause of bitter wail;
 But tell me, going o'er the ground again,
 How great the number of the Hellenes' navy,
 That they presumed with Persia's armament
 To wage their warfare in the clash of ships.

 _Mess._ As far as numbers went, be sure the ships
 Of Persia had the better, for the Hellenes                          340
 Had, as their total, ships but fifteen score,
 And other ten selected as reserve.[31]
 And Xerxes (well I know it) had a thousand
 Which he commanded—those that most excelled[32]
 In speed were twice five score and seven in number;
 So stands the account. Deem'st thou our forces less
 In that encounter? Nay, some Power above
 Destroyed our host, and pressed the balance down
 With most unequal fortune, and the Gods
 Preserve the city of the Goddess Pallas.

 _Atoss._ Is the Athenians' city then unsacked?               350

 _Mess._ Their men are left, and that is bulwark strong.[33]

 _Atoss._ Next tell me how the fight of ships began.
 Who led the attack? Were those Hellenes the first,
 Or was't my son, exulting in his strength?

 _Mess._ The author of the mischief, O my mistress,
 Was some foul fiend or Power on evil bent;
 For lo! a Hellene from the Athenian host[34]
 Came to thy son, to Xerxes, and spake thus,
 That should the shadow of the dark night come,
 The Hellenes would not wait him, but would leap                     360
 Into their rowers' benches, here and there,
 And save their lives in secret, hasty flight.
 And he forthwith, this hearing, knowing not
 The Hellene's guile, nor yet the Gods' great wrath,
 Gives this command to all his admirals,
 Soon as the sun should cease to burn the earth
 With his bright rays, and darkness thick invade
 The firmament of heaven, to set their ships
 In threefold lines, to hinder all escape,
 And guard the billowy straits, and others place                     370
 In circuit round about the isle of Aias:
 For if the Hellenes 'scaped an evil doom,
 And found a way of secret, hasty flight,
 It was ordained that all should lose their heads.[35]
 Such things he spake from soul o'erwrought with pride,
 For he knew not what fate the Gods would send;
 And they, not mutinous, but prompt to serve,
 Then made their supper ready, and each sailor
 Fastened his oar around true-fitting thole;
 And when the sunlight vanished, and the night
 Had come, then each man, master of an oar,                          380
 Went to his ship, and all men bearing arms,
 And through the long ships rank cheered loud to rank;
 And so they sail, as 'twas appointed each,
 And all night long the captains of the fleet
 Kept their men working, rowing to and fro;
 Night then came on, and the Hellenic host
 In no wise sought to take to secret flight.
 And when day, bright to look on with white steeds,
 O'erspread the earth, then rose from the Hellenes                   390
 Loud chant of cry of battle, and forthwith
 Echo gave answer from each island rock;
 And terror then on all the Persians fell,
 Of fond hopes disappointed. Not in flight
 The Hellenes then their solemn pæans sang:
 But with brave spirit hasting on to battle.
 With martial sound the trumpet fired those ranks;
 And straight with sweep of oars that flew through foam,
 They smote the loud waves at the boatswain's call;
 And swiftly all were manifest to sight.                             400
 Then first their right wing moved in order meet;[36]
 Next the whole line its forward course began,
 And all at once we heard a mighty shout,—
 “O sons of Hellenes, forward, free your country;
 Free too your wives, your children, and the shrines
 Built to your fathers' Gods, and holy tombs
 Your ancestors now rest in. Now the fight
 Is for our all.” And on our side indeed
 Arose in answer din of Persian speech,
 And time to wait was over; ship on ship                             410
 Dashed its bronze-pointed beak, and first a barque
 Of Hellas did the encounter fierce begin,[37]
 And from Phœnikian vessel crashes off
 Her carved prow. And each against his neighbour
 Steers his own ship: and first the mighty flood
 Of Persian host held out. But when the ships
 Were crowded in the straits,[38] nor could they give
 Help to each other, they with mutual shocks,
 With beaks of bronze went crushing each the other,
 Shivering their rowers' benches. And the ships
 Of Hellas, with manœuvring not unskilful,
 Charged circling round them. And the hulls of ships                 420
 Floated capsized, nor could the sea be seen,
 Strown, as it was, with wrecks and carcases;
 And all the shores and rocks were full of corpses.
 And every ship was wildly rowed in fight,
 All that composed the Persian armament.
 And they, as men spear tunnies,[39] or a haul
 Of other fishes, with the shafts of oars,
 Or spars of wrecks went smiting, cleaving down;
 And bitter groans and wailings overspread
 The wide sea-waves, till eye of swarthy night                       430
 Bade it all cease: and for the mass of ills,
 Not, though my tale should run for ten full days,
 Could I in full recount them. Be assured
 That never yet so great a multitude
 Died in a single day as died in this.

 _Atoss._ Ah, me! Great then the sea of ills that breaks
 On Persia and the whole barbaric host.

 _Mess._ Be sure our evil fate is but half o'er:
 On this has supervened such bulk of woe,
 As more than twice to outweigh what I've told.                      440

 _Atoss._ And yet what fortune could be worse than this?
 Say, what is this disaster which thou tell'st,
 That turns the scale to greater evils still?

 _Mess._ Those Persians that were in the bloom of life,
 Bravest in heart and noblest in their blood,
 And by the king himself deemed worthiest trust,
 Basely and by most shameful death have died.

 _Atoss._ Ah! woe is me, my friends, for our ill fate!
 What was the death by which thou say'st they perished?

 _Mess._ There is an isle that lies off Salamis,[40]
 Small, with bad anchorage for ships, where Pan,                     450
 Pan the dance-loving, haunts the sea-washed coast.
 There Xerxes sends these men, that when their foes,
 Being wrecked, should to the islands safely swim,
 They might with ease destroy th' Hellenic host,
 And save their friends from out the deep sea's paths;
 But ill the future guessing: for when God
 Gave the Hellenes the glory of the battle,
 In that same hour, with arms well wrought in bronze
 Shielding their bodies, from their ships they leapt,
 And the whole isle encircled, so that we                            460
 Were sore distressed,[41] and knew not where to turn;
 For here men's hands hurled many a stone at them;
 And there the arrows from the archer's bow
 Smote and destroyed them; and with one great rush,
 At last advancing, they upon them dash
 And smite, and hew the limbs of these poor wretches,
 Till they each foe had utterly destroyed.
 [And Xerxes when he saw how deep the ill,[42]
 Groaned out aloud, for he had ta'en his seat,
 With clear, wide view of all the army round,
 On a high cliff hard by the open sea;
 And tearing then his robes with bitter cry,                         470
 And giving orders to his troops on shore,
 He sends them off in foul retreat. This grief
 'Tis thine to mourn besides the former ills.]

 _Atoss._ O hateful Power, how thou of all their hopes
 Hast robbed the Persians! Bitter doom my son
 Devised for glorious Athens, nor did they,
 The invading host who fell at Marathon,
 Suffice; but my son, counting it his task
 To exact requital for it, brought on him
 So great a crowd of sorrows. But I pray,
 As to those ships that have this fate escaped,                      480
 Where did'st thou leave them? Can'st thou clearly tell?

 _Mess._ The captains of the vessels that were left,
 With a fair wind, but not in meet array,
 Took flight: and all the remnant of the army
 Fell in Bœotia—some for stress of thirst
 About the fountain clear, and some of us,
 Panting for breath, cross to the Phokians' land,
 The soil of Doris, and the Melian gulf,
 Where fair Spercheios waters all the plains
 With kindly flood, and then the Achæan fields                       490
 And city of the Thessali received us,
 Famished for lack of food;[43] and many died
 Of thirst and hunger, for both ills we bore;
 And then to the Magnetian land we came,
 And that of Macedonians, to the stream
 Of Axios, and Bolbe's reed-grown marsh,
 And Mount Pangaios and the Edonian land.
 And on that night God sent a mighty frost,
 Unwonted at that season, sealing up
 The whole course of the Strymon's pure, clear flood;[44]
 And they who erst had deemed the Gods as nought,                    500
 Then prayed with hot entreaties, worshipping
 Both earth and heaven. And after that the host
 Ceased from its instant calling on the Gods,
 It crosses o'er the glassy, frozen stream;
 And whosoe'er set forth before the rays
 Of the bright God were shed abroad, was saved;
 For soon the glorious sun with burning blaze
 Reached the mid-stream and warmed it with its flame,
 And they, confused, each on the other fell.
 Blest then was he whose soul most speedily
 Breathed out its life. And those who yet survived
 And gained deliverance, crossing with great toil                    510
 And many a pang through Thrakè, now are come,
 Escaped from perils, no great number they,
 To this our sacred land, and so it groans,
 This city of the Persians, missing much
 Our country's dear-loved youth. Too true my tale,
 And many things I from my speech omit,
 Ills which the Persians suffer at God's hand.

 _Chor._ O Power resistless, with what weight of woe
 On all the Persian race have thy feet leapt!

 _Atoss._ Ah! woe is me for that our army lost!
 O vision of the night that cam'st in dreams,                        520
 Too clearly did'st thou show me of these ills!
 But ye (_to Chorus_) did judge them far too carelessly;
 Yet since your counsel pointed to that course,
 I to the Gods will first my prayer address.
 And then with gifts to Earth and to the Dead,
 Bringing the chrism from my store, I'll come.
 For our past ills, I know, 'tis all too late,
 But for the future, I may hope, will dawn
 A better fortune! But 'tis now your part
 In these our present ills, in counsel faithful
 To commune with the Faithful; and my son,                           530
 Should he come here before me, comfort him,
 And home escort him, lest he add fresh ill
 To all these evils that we suffer now. [_Exit_

 _Chor._ Zeus our king, who now to nothing
 Bring'st the army of the Persians,
 Multitudinous, much boasting;
 And with gloomy woe hast shrouded
 Both Ecbatana and Susa;
 Many maidens now are tearing
 With their tender hands their mantles,                              540
 And with tear-floods wet their bosoms,
 In the common grief partaking;
 And the brides of Persian warriors,
 Dainty even in their wailing,
 Longing for their new-wed husbands,
 Reft of bridal couch luxurious,
 With its coverlet so dainty,
 Losing joy of wanton youth-time,
 Mourn in never-sated wailings.
 And I too in fullest measure
 Raise again meet cry of sorrow,
 Weeping for the loved and lost ones.


                               STROPHE I

 For now the land of Asia mourneth sore,                             550
           Left desolate of men,
       'Twas Xerxes led them forth, woe! woe!
       'Twas Xerxes lost them all, woe! woe!
 'Twas Xerxes who with evil counsels sped
       Their course in sea-borne barques.
 Why was Dareios erst so free from harm,
       First bowman of the state,
 The leader whom the men of Susa loved,


                             ANTISTROPHE I

 While those who fought as soldiers or at sea,                       560
         These ships, dark-hulled, well-rowed,
     Their own ships bore them on, woe! woe!
     Their own ships lost them all, woe! woe!
 Their own ships, in the crash of ruin urged,
         And by Ionian hands?[45]
 The king himself, we hear, but hardly 'scapes,
       Through Thrakè's widespread steppes,
 And paths o'er which the tempests wildly sweep.


                               STROPHE II

         And they who perished first, ah me!                         570
         Perforce unburied left, alas!
 Are scattered round Kychreia's shore,[46] woe! woe!
 Lament, mourn sore, and raise a bitter cry,
         Grievous, the sky to pierce, woe! woe!
 And let thy mourning voice uplift its strain
         Of loud and full lament.


                             ANTISTROPHE II

         Torn by the whirling flood, ah me!
         Their carcases are gnawed, alas!
 By the dumb brood of stainless sea, woe! woe!                       580
 And each house mourneth for its vanished lord;
         And childless sires, woe! woe!
 Mourning in age o'er griefs the Gods have sent,
         Now hear their utter loss.


                              STROPHE III

         And throughout all Asia's borders
         None now own the sway of Persia,
         Nor bring any more their tribute,
         Owning sway of sovereign master.
         Low upon the Earth, laid prostrate,                         590
         Is the strength of our great monarch


                            ANTISTROPHE III

         No more need men keep in silence
         Tongues fast bound: for now the people
         May with freedom speak at pleasure;
         For the yoke of power is broken;
         And blood-stained in all its meadows
         Holds the sea-washed isle of Aias
         What was once the host of Persia.

                           _Re-enter_ ATOSSA

 _Atoss._ Whoe'er, my friends, is vexed in troublous times,   600
 Knows that when once a tide of woe sets in,
 A man is wont to fear in everything;
 But when Fate flows on smoothly, then to trust
 That the same Fate will ever send fair gales.
 So now all these disasters from the Gods
 Seem in mine eyes filled full of fear and dread,
 And in mine ears rings cry unpæanlike,
 So great a dread of all has seized my soul:
 And therefore now, without or chariot's state
 Or wonted pomp, have I thus issued forth                            610
 From out my palace, to my son's sire bringing
 Libations loving, gifts propitiatory,
 Meet for the dead; milk pure and white from cow
 Unblemished, and bright honey that distils
 From the flower-working bee, and water drawn
 From virgin fountain, and the draught unmarred
 From mother wild, bright child of ancient vine;
 And here too of the tree that evermore
 Keeps its fresh life in foliage, the pale olive,
 Is the sweet-smelling fruit, and twinèd wreaths
 Of flowers, the children of all-bearing earth.[47]                  620
 But ye, my friends, o'er these libations poured
 In honour of the dead, chant forth your hymns,
 And call upon Dareios as a God:
 While I will send unto the Gods below
 These votive offerings which the earth shall drink.

                           [_Goes to the tomb of_ DAREIOS _in the centre
                               of the stage_

 _Chor._ O royal lady, honoured of the Persians,
         Do thou libations pour
 To the dark chambers of the dead below;
         And we with hymns will pray
 The Powers that act as escorts of the dead
 To give us kindly help beneath the earth.
 But oh, ye holy Ones in darkness dwelling,                          630
 Hermes and Earth, and thou, the Lord of Hell,
         Send from beneath a soul
         Up to the light of earth;
 For should he know a cure for these our ills,
 He, he alone of men, their end may tell.


                               STROPHE I

         Doth he, the blest one hear,
         The king, like Gods in power,
         Hear me, as I send forth
         My cries in barbarous speech,
         Yet very clear to him,—
         Sad, varied, broken cries
         So as to tell aloud
         Our troubles terrible?                                      640
         Ah, doth he hear below?


                             ANTISTROPHE I

         But thou, O Earth, and ye,
         The other Lords of those
         Beneath the grave that dwell;
         Grant that the godlike one
         May come from out your home,
         The Persians' mighty God,
         In Susa's palace born;
         Send him, I pray you, up,
         The like of whom the soil
         Of Persia never hid.


                               STROPHE II

 Dear was our chief, and dear to us his tomb,
         For dear the life it hides;                                 650
 Aidoneus, O Aidoneus, send him forth,
 Thou who dost lead the dead to Earth again,
 *Yea, send Dareios.... What a king was he!


                             ANTISTROPHE II

 For never did he in war's bloody woe
         Lose all his warrior-host,
 But Heaven-taught Counsellor the Persians called him,
 And Heaven-taught Counsellor in truth he proved,
 Since he still ruled his hosts of subjects well.


                              STROPHE III

 Monarch, O ancient monarch, come, oh, come,
 Come to the summit of sepulchral mound,                             660
         Lifting thy foot encased
         In slipper saffron-dyed,
         And giving to our view
         Thy royal tiara's crest:[48]
 Speak, O Dareios, faultless father, speak.


                            ANTISTROPHE III

 Yea, come, that thou, O Lord, may'st hear the woes,
 Woes new and strange, our lord has now endured;
         For on us now has fallen
         A dark and Stygian mist,
         Since all the armed youth
         Has perished utterly;
 Speak, O Dareios, faultless father, speak.


                                 EPODE

         O thou, whose death thy friends
         Bewail with many tears,                                     670
         *Why thus, O Lord of lords,
 *In double error of wild frenzy born,
         Have all our triremes good
         Been lost to this our land,
 Ships that are ships no more, yea, ships no more?

         _The_ Ghost _of_ DAREIOS _appears on the summit of the
                                 mound_


 _Dar._ O faithful of the Faithful, ye who were
 Companions of my youth, ye Persian elders,

 What troubles is't my country toils beneath?
 The whole plain groans, cut up and furrowed o'er,[49]
 And I, beholding now my queen beloved
 Standing hard by my sepulchre, feared much,                         680
 And her libations graciously received;
 But ye wail loud near this my sepulchre,
 And shouting shrill with cries that raise the dead,
 Ye call me with your plaints. No easy task
 Is it to come, for this cause above all,
 That the great Gods who reign below are apter
 To seize men than release: yet natheless I,
 Being great in power among them, now am come.
 Be quick then, that none blame me as too late;[50]
 What new dire evils on the Persians weigh?

 _Chor._ I fear to look on thee,                              690
   Fear before thee to speak,
 With all the awe of thee I felt of old.

 _Dar._ But since I came by thy complaints persuaded,
 From below rising, spin no lengthened tale;
 But shortly, clearly speak, and tell thy story,
 And leave awhile thine awe and fear of me.

 _Chor._ I dread thy wish to grant,
   *I dread to say thee nay,[51]
 Saying things that it is hard for friends to speak.

 _Dar._ Nay, then, since that old dread of thine prevents thee,
 Do thou [_to_ ATOSSA], the ancient partner of my bed,700
 My noble queen, from these thy plaints and moanings
 Cease, and say something clearly. Human sorrows
 May well on mortals fall; for many evils,
 Some on the sea, and some on dry land also,
 Happen to men if life be far prolongèd.

 _Atoss._ O thou, who in the fate of fair good fortune
 Excelled'st all men, who, while yet thou sawest
 The sun's bright rays, did'st lead a life all blessed,
 Admired, yea, worshipped as a God by Persians,
 Now, too, I count thee blest in that thou died'st
 Before thou saw'st the depth of these our evils.
 For now, Dareios, thou shalt hear a story
 Full, yet in briefest moment. Utter ruin,
 To sum up all, is come upon the Persians.                           710

 _Dar._ How so? Hath plague or discord seized my country?

 _Atoss._ Not so, but all the host is lost near Athens.

 _Dar._ What son of mine led that host hither, tell me?[52]

 _Atoss._ Xerxes o'er-hasty, emptying all the mainland.

 _Dar._ Made he this mad attempt by land or water?

 _Atoss._ By both; two lines there were of two great armies.

 _Dar._ How did so great a host effect its passage?

 _Atoss._ He bridged the straits of Helle, and found transit.

 _Dar._ Did he prevail to close the mighty Bosporos?

 _Atoss._ So was it; yet some God, it may be, helped him.     720

 _Dar._ Alas! some great God came and stole his wisdom.

 _Atoss._ Yea, the end shows what evil he accomplished.

 _Dar._ And how have they fared, that ye thus bewail them?

 _Atoss._ The naval host, o'ercome, wrecked all the land-force.

 _Dar._ What! Is the whole host by the spear laid prostrate?

 _Atoss._ For this doth Susa's city mourn her losses.

 _Dar._ Alas, for that brave force and mighty army!

 _Atoss._ The Bactrians all are lost, not old men merely.

 _Dar._ Poor fool! how he hath lost his host's fresh vigour!

 _Atoss._ Xerxes, they say, alone, with but few others....    730

 _Dar._ What is his end, and where? Is there no safety?

 _Atoss._ Was glad to gain the bridge that joins two mainlands.

 _Dar._ And has he reached this mainland? Is that certain?

 _Atoss._ Yea, the report holds good. Here is no discord.[53]

 _Dar._ Ah me! Full swift the oracles' fulfilment!
 And on my son hath Zeus their end directed.
 I hoped the Gods would work them out more slowly;
 But when man hastens, God too with him worketh.
 And now for all my friends a fount of evils
 Seems to be found. And this my son, not knowing,                    740
 In youth's rash mood, hath wrought; for he did purpose
 To curb the sacred Hellespont with fetters,
 As though it were his slave, and sought to alter
 The stream of God, the Bosporos, full-flowing,
 And his well-hammered chains around it casting,
 Prevailed to make his mighty host a highway;
 And though a mortal, thought, with no good counsel,
 To master all the Gods, yea, e'en Poseidon.
 Nay, was not my poor son oppressed with madness?
 And much I fear lest all my heaped-up treasure
 Become the spoil and prey of the first comer.

 _Atoss._ Such things the o'er-hasty Xerxes learns from others,750
 By intercourse with men of evil counsel;[54]
 Who say that thou great wealth for thy son gained'st
 By thy spear's might, while he with coward spirit
 Does his spear-work indoors, and nothing addeth
 Unto his father's glory. Such reproaches
 Hearing full oft from men of evil counsel,
 He planned this expedition against Hellas.

 _Dar._ Thus then a deed portentous hath been wrought,
 Ever to be remembered, such as ne'er
 Falling on Susa made it desolate,
 Since Zeus our king ordained this dignity,
 That one man should be lord of Asia's plains.
 Where feed her thousand flocks, and hold the rod                    760
 Of sovran guidance: for the Median first[55]
 Ruled o'er the host, and then his son in turn
 Finished the work, for reason steered his soul;
 And Kyros came as third, full richly blest,
 And ruled, and gained great peace for all his friends;
 And he won o'er the Lydians and the Phrygians,
 And conquered all the wide Ionian land;[56]
 For such his wisdom, he provoked not God.
 And Kyros' son came fourth, and ruled the host;
 And Mardos fifth held sway, his country's shame,[57]                770
 Shame to the ancient throne; and him with guile
 Artaphrenes[58] the brave smote down, close leagued
 With men, his friends, to whom the work was given.
 [Sixth, Maraphis and seventh Artaphrenes,]
 And I obtained this post that I desired,
 And with a mighty host great victories won.
 Yet no such evil brought I on the state;
 But my son Xerxes, young, thinks like a youth,
 And all my solemn charge remembers not;
 For know this well, my old companions true,                         780
 That none of us who swayed the realm of old,
 Did e'er appear as working ills like these.

 _Chor._ What then, O King Dareios? To what end
 Lead'st thou thy speech? And how, in this our plight,
 Could we, the Persian people, prosper best?

 _Dar._ If ye no more attack the Hellenes' land,
 E'en though the Median host outnumbers theirs.
 To them the very land is true ally.

 _Chor._ What meanest thou? How fights the land for them?

 _Dar._ *It slays with famine those vast multitudes.790

 _Chor._ We then a host, select, compact, will raise.

 _Dar._ Nay, e'en the host which now in Hellas stays[59]
 Will ne'er return in peace and safety home.

 _Chor._ How say'st thou? Does not all the barbarous host
 Cross from Europa o'er the straits of Hellè?

 _Dar._ But few of many; if 'tis meet for one
 Who looks upon the things already done
 To trust the oracles of Gods; for they,
 Not these or those, but all, are brought to pass:
 If this be so, then, resting on vain hopes,[60]                     800
 He leaves a chosen portion of his host:
 And they abide where, watering all the plain,
 Asôpos pours his fertilising stream
 Dear to Bœotian land; and there of ills
 The topmost crown awaits them, penalty
 Of wanton outrage and of godless thoughts;
 For they to Hellas coming, held not back
 In awe from plundering sculptured forms of Gods[61]
 And burning down their temples; and laid low
 Are altars, and the shrines of Gods o'erthrown,
 E'en from their base. They therefore having wrought
 Deeds evil, now are suffering, and will suffer
 Evil not less, and not as yet is seen                               810
 *E'en the bare groundwork of the ills, but still
 They grow up to completeness. Such a stream
 Of blood and slaughter soon shall flow from them
 By Dorian spear upon Platæan ground,[62]
 And heaps of corpses shall to children's children,
 Though speechless, witness to the eyes of men
 That mortal man should not wax overproud;
 For wanton pride from blossom grows to fruit,
 The full corn in the ear, of utter woe,
 And reaps a tear-fraught harvest. Seeing then,
 Such recompense of these things, cherish well
 The memory of Athens and of Hellas;                                 820
 Let no man in his scorn of present fortune,
 And thirst for other, mar his good estate;
 Zeus is the avenger of o'er-lofty thoughts,
 A terrible controller. Therefore now,
 Since voice of God bids him be wise of heart,
 Admonish him with counsel true and good
 To cease his daring sacrilegious pride;
 And thou, O Xerxes' mother, old and dear,
 Go to thy home, and taking what apparel
 Is fitting, go to meet thy son; for all                             830
 The costly robes around his limbs are torn
 To rags and shreds in grief's wild agony.
 But do thou gently soothe his soul with words;
 For he to thee alone will deign to hearken;
 But I must leave the earth for darkness deep:
 And ye, old men, farewell, although in woe,
 And give your soul its daily bread of joy;
 For to the dead no profit bringeth wealth.

                                     [_Exit, disappearing in the earth._


 _Chor._ I shudder as I hear the many woes
 Both past and present that on Persians fall.                        840

 _Atoss._ [O God, how many evils fall on me![63]
 And yet this one woe biteth more than all,
 Hearing my son's shame in the rags of robes
 That clothe his limbs. But I will go and take
 A fit adornment from my house, and try
 To meet my son. We will not in his troubles
 Basely abandon him whom most we love.]


                               STROPHE I

 _Chor._ Ah me! a glorious and a blessed life
   Had we as subjects once,
 When our old king, Dareios, ruled the land,                         850
 Meeting all wants, dispassionate, supreme,
   A monarch like a God.


                             ANTISTROPHE I

 For first we showed the world our noble hosts;
   And laws of tower-like strength
 Directed all things; and our backward march
 After our wars unhurt, unsuffering led
   Our prospering armies home.


                               STROPHE II

 How many towns he took,
 Not crossing Halys' stream[64]                                      860
 Nor issuing from his home,
         There where in Strymon's sea,
         The Acheloian Isles[65]
 Lie near the coasts of Thrakian colonies.


                             ANTISTROPHE II

 And those that lie outside the Ægæan main,
         The cities girt with towers,
         They hearkened to our king;
         And those who boast their site
         By Hellè's full, wide stream,
 Propontis with its bays, and mouth of Pontos broad.                 870


                              STROPHE III

         And all the isles that lie
 Facing the headland jutting in the sea,[66]
         Close bound to this our coast;
 Lesbos, and Samos with its olive groves;
         Chios and Paros too;
 Naxos and Myconos, and Andros too
         On Tenos bordering.


                            ANTISTROPHE III

         And so he ruled the isles
 That lie midway between the continents,
         Lemnos, and Icaros,
 Rhodes and Cnidos and the Kyprian towns,                            880
   Paphos and Soli famed,
   And with them Salamis,
 Whose parent city now our groans doth cause;[67]


                                 EPODE

 And many a wealthy town and populous,
 Of Hellenes in the Ionian region dwelling,
   He by his counsel ruled;
 His was the unconquered strength of warrior host,
   Allies of mingled race.
   And now, beyond all doubt,
 In strife of war defeated utterly,
   We find this high estate
   Through wrath of God o'erturned,                                  890
   And we are smitten low,
   By bitter loss at sea.

      _Enter_ XERXES _in kingly apparel, but with his robes rent,
                           with_ Attendants.

 _Xer._ Oh, miserable me!
 Who this dark hateful doom
 That I expected least
 Have met with as my lot,
 With what stern mood and fierce
 Towards the Persian race
 Is God's hand laid on us!
 What woe will come on me?
 Gone is my strength of limb,
 As I these elders see.
 Ah, would to Heaven, O Zeus,
 That with the men who fell
 Death's doom had covered me!                                        900

   _Chor._ Ah, woe, O King, woe! woe!
   For the army brave in fight,
   And our goodly Persian name,
   And the fair array of men,
   Whom God hath now cut off!
   And the land bewails its youth
   Who for our Xerxes fell,
   For him whose deeds have filled
   *Hades with Persian souls;
   For many heroes now
   *Are Hades-travellers,
   Our country's chosen flower,
   Mighty with darts and bow;
   *For lo! the myriad mass                               910
   Of men has perished quite.
   Woe, woe for our fair fame!
   And Asia's land, O King,
 Is terribly, most terribly, o'erthrown.

   _Xer._ I then, oh misery!
   Have to my curse been proved
 Sore evil to my country and my race.

 _Chor._ Yea, and on thy return
 I will lift up my voice in wailing loud,
   Cry of sore-troubled thought,
   As of a mourner born
   In Mariandynian land,[68]                                         920
   Lament of many tears.


                             ANTISTROPHE I

 _Xer._ Yea, utter ye a wail
   Dreary and full of grief;
 For lo! the face of Fate
 Against me now is turned.

 _Chor._ Yea, I will raise a cry
 Dreary and full of grief,
 Giving this tribute due
 To all the people's woes,
 And all our loss at sea,
 Troubles of this our State
 That mourneth for her sons;
 Yea, I will wail full sore,
 With flood of bitter tears.


                               STROPHE II

 _Xer._ For Ares, he whose might
 Was in our ships' array,
 Giving victory to our foes,
 Has in Ionians, yea,
 Ionians, found his match,
 And from the dark sea's plain,
 And that ill-omened shore,
 Has a fell harvest reaped.

 _Chor._ Yea, wail, search out the whole;
 Where are our other friends?
 Where thy companions true,
 Such as Pharandakes,
 Susas, Pelagon, Psammis, Dotamas,
 Agdabatas, Susiskanes,
 From Ecbatana who started?


                             ANTISTROPHE II

 _Xer._ I left them low in death,
 Falling from Tyrian ship,
 On Salaminian shores,
 Beating now here, now there,
 On the hard rock-girt coast.

 _Chor._ Ah, where Pharnuchos then,
       And Ariomardos brave?
       And where Sevalkes king,
       Lilæos proud of race,
       Memphis and Tharybis,
       Masistras, and Artembares,                                    950
       Hystæchmas? This I ask.


                              STROPHE III

 _Xer._ Woe! woe is me!
 They have looked on at Athens' ancient towers,
       Her hated towers, ah me!
       All, as by one fell stroke,
       Unhappy in their fate
       Lie gasping on the shore.

 _Chor._ And he, thy faithful Eye,[69]                        960
       Who told the Persian host,
       Myriads on myriads o'er,[70]
       Alpistos, son and heir
       Of Batanôchos old
        ·       ·       ·       ·       ·
       And the son of brave Sesames,
       Son himself of Megabates?
       Parthos, and the great Œbares,
 Did'st thou leave them, did'st thou leave them?
       Ah, woe! ah, woe is me,
       For those unhappy ones!
       Thou to the Persians brave
       Tellest of ills on ills.


                            ANTISTROPHE III

 _Xer._ Ah, thou dost wake in me
 The memory of the spell of yearning love
       For comrades brave and true,
     Telling of cursed ills,
     Yea, cursed, hateful doom;                                      970
     And lo, within my frame
     My heart cries out, cries out.

 _Chor._ Yea, another too we long for,
     Xanthes, captain of ten thousand
     Mardian warriors, and Anchares
     Arian born, and great Arsakes
     And Diæxis, lords of horsemen,
     Kigdagatas and Lythimnas,
     Tolmos, longing for the battle:                                 980
     *Much I marvel, much I marvel,[71]
     For they come not, as the rear-guard
     Of thy tent on chariot mounted.[72]


                               STROPHE IV

 _Xer._ Gone those rulers of the army.

 _Chor._ Gone are they in death inglorious.

 _Xer._ Ah woe! ah woe! Alas! alas!

 _Chor._ Ah! the Gods have sent upon us
     Ill we never thought to look on,
     Eminent above all others;
     Ne'er hath Atè seen its equal.


                             ANTISTROPHE IV

 Smitten we by many sorrows,                                         990
 Such as come on men but seldom.

 _Chor._ Smitten we, 'tis all too certain....

 _Xer._ Fresh woes! fresh woes! ah me!

 _Chor._ Now with adverse turn of fortune,
 With Ionian seamen meeting,
 Fails in war the race of Persians.


                               STROPHE V

 _Xer._ Too true. Yea I and that vast host of mine
 Are smitten down.

 _Chor._ Too true—the Persians' majesty and might
 Have perished utterly.

 _Xer._ See'st thou this remnant of my armament?

 _Chor._ I see it, yea, I see.                               1000

 _Xer._ (_pointing to his quiver._) Dost see thou that
 which arrows wont to hold?...

 _Chor._ What speak'st thou of as saved?

 _Xer._ This treasure-store for darts.

 _Chor._ Few, few of many left!

 _Xer._ Thus we all helpers lack.

 _Chor._ Ionian soldiers flee not from the spear.


                             ANTISTROPHE V

 _Xer._ Yea, very brave are they, and I have seen
 Unlooked-for woe.

 _Chor._ Wilt tell of squadron of our sea-borne ships
 Defeated utterly?

 _Xer._ I tore my robes at this calamity.

 _Chor._ Ah me, ah me, ah me.                                1010

 _Xer._ Ay, more than all 'ah me's'!

 _Chor._ Twofold and threefold ills!

 _Xer._ Grievous to us—but joy,
 Great joy, to all our foes!

 _Chor._ Lopped off is all our strength.

 _Xer._ Stripped bare of escort I!

 _Chor._ Yea, by sore loss at sea
     Disastrous to thy friends.


                               STROPHE VI

 _Xer._ Weep for our sorrow, weep,
     Yea, go ye to the house.

 _Chor._ Woe for our griefs, woe, woe!

 _Xer._ Cry out an echoing cry.

 _Chor._ Ill gift of ills on ills.                           1020

 _Xer._ Weep on in wailing chant.

 _Chor._ Oh! ah! Oh! ah!

 _Xer._ Grievous our bitter woes.

 _Chor._ Ah me, I mourn them sore.


                             ANTISTROPHE VI

 _Xer._ Ply, ply your hands and groan;
     Yea, for my sake bewail.

 _Chor._ I weep in bitter grief.

 _Xer._ Cry out an echoing cry.

 _Chor._ Yea, we may raise our voice,
     O Lord and King, in wail.

 _Xer._ Raise now shrill cry of woe.

 _Chor._ Ah me! Ah! Woe is me!                               1030

 _Xer._ Yea, with it mingle dark....

 _Chor._ And bitter, grievous blows.


                              STROPHE VII

 _Xer._ Yea, beat thy breast, and cry
     After the Mysian type.

 _Chor._ Oh, misery! oh, misery!

 _Xer._ Yea, tear the white hair off thy flowing beard.

 _Chor._ Yea; with clenched hands, with clenchèd hands, I say,
     In very piteous guise.

 _Xer._ Cry out, cry out aloud.

 _Chor._ That also will I do.


                            ANTISTROPHE VII

 _Xer._ And with thy fingers tear
     Thy bosom's folded robe.

 _Chor._ Oh, misery! oh, misery!                             1040

 _Xer._ Yea, tear thy hair in wailing for our host.

 _Chor._ Yea, with clenched hands, I say, with clenchèd hands,
     In very piteous guise.

 _Xer._ Be thine eyes wet with tears.

 _Chor._ Behold the tears stream down.


                                 EPODE

 _Xer._ Raise a re-echoing cry.

 _Chor._ Ah woe! ah woe!

 _Xer._ Go to thy home with wailing loud and long.

 _Chor._ O land of Persia, full of lamentations!

 _Xer._ Through the town raise your cries.

 _Chor._ We raise them, yea, we raise.                       1050

 _Xer._ Wail, wail, ye men that walked so daintily.

 _Chor._ O land of Persia, full of lamentations!
     Woe; woe!

 _Xer._ Alas for those who in the triremes perished!

 _Chor._ With broken cries of woe will I escort thee.

                                    [_Exeunt in procession, wailing, and
                                        rending their robes._

-----

Footnote 3:

  “The Faithful,” or “trusty,” seems to have been a special title of
  honour given to the veteran councillors of the king (Xenoph. _Anab._
  i. 15), just as that of the “Immortals” was chosen for his body-guard
  (Herod, vii. 83).

Footnote 4:

  Susa was pre-eminently the treasury of the Persian kings (Herod, v.
  49; Strabo, xv. p. 731), their favourite residence in spring, as
  Ecbatana in Media was in summer and Babylon in winter.

Footnote 5:

  Kissia was properly the name of the district in which Susa stood; but
  here, and in v. 123, it is treated as if it belonged to a separate
  city. Throughout the play there is, indeed, a lavish use of Persian
  barbaric names of persons and places, without a very minute regard to
  historical accuracy.

Footnote 6:

  Here, as in Herodotos and Greek writers generally, the title, “the
  King,” or “the great King,” was enough. It could be understood only of
  the Persian. The latter name had been borne by the kings of Assyria (2
  Kings xviii. 28). A little later it passed into the fuller, more
  boastful form of “The King of kings.”

Footnote 7:

  The inhabitants of the Delta of the Nile, especially those of the
  marshy districts near the Heracleotic mouth, were famed as supplying
  the best and bravest soldiers of any part of Egypt.—Comp. Thucyd. i.
  110.

Footnote 8:

  The epithet was applied probably by Æschylos to the Lydians properly
  so called, the barbaric race with whom the Hellenes had little or
  nothing in common. They, in dress, diet, mode of life, their distaste
  for the contests of the arena, seemed to the Greeks the very type of
  effeminacy. The Ionian Greeks, however, were brought under the same
  influence, and gradually acquired the same character. The suppression
  of the name of the Ionians in the list of the Persian forces may be
  noticed as characteristic. The Athenian poet would not bring before an
  Athenian audience the shame of their Asiatic kinsmen.

Footnote 9:

  Tmôlos, sacred as being the mythical birth-place of Dionysos.

Footnote 10:

  “Spear-anvils,” _sc._, meeting the spear of their foes as the anvils
  would meet it, turning its point, themselves steadfast and immovable.

Footnote 11:

  So Herodotos (vii. 74) in his account of the army of Xerxes describes
  the Mysians as using for their weapons those darts or “javelins” made
  by hardening the ends in the fire.

Footnote 12:

  Helle the daughter of Athamas, from whom the Hellespont took its name.
  For the description of the pontoons formed by boats, which were moored
  together with cables and finally covered with faggots, comp. Herod,
  vii. 36.

Footnote 13:

  “Gold-born,” _sc._, descended from Perseus, the child of Danaë.

Footnote 14:

  Syrian, either in the vague sense in which it became almost synonymous
  with Assyrian, or else showing that Syria, properly so called,
  retained the fame for chariots which it had had at a period as early
  as the time of the Hebrew Judges (Judg. v. 3). Herodotos (vii. 140)
  gives an Oracle of Delphi in which the same epithet appears.

Footnote 15:

  The description, though put into the mouth of Persians, is meant to
  flatter Hellenic pride. The Persians and their army were for the most
  part light-armed troops only, barbarians equipped with javelins or
  bows. In the sculptures of Persepolis, as in those of Nineveh and
  Khorsabad, this mode of warfare is throughout the most conspicuous.
  They, the Hellenes, were the _hoplites_, warriors of the spear and the
  shield, the cuirass and the greaves.

Footnote 16:

  A touch of Athenian exultation in their life as seamen. To them the
  sea was almost a home. They were familiar with it from childhood. To
  the Persians it was new and untried. They had a new lesson to learn,
  late in the history of the nation, late in the lives of individual
  soldiers.

Footnote 17:

  The bridge of boats, with the embankment raised upon it, is thought of
  as a new headland putting out from the one shore and reaching to the
  other.

Footnote 18:

  Stress is laid by the Hellenic poet, as in the _Agamemnon_ (v. 895),
  and in v. 707 of this play, on the tendency of the East to give to its
  kings the names and the signs of homage which were due only to the
  Gods. The Hellenes might deify a dead hero, but not a living
  sovereign. On different grounds the Jews shrank, as in the stories of
  Nebuchadnezzar and Dareios (Dan. iii. 6), from all such acts.

Footnote 19:

  In the Greek, as in the translation, there is a change of metre,
  intended apparently to represent the transition from the tone of eager
  excitement to the ordinary level of discourse.

Footnote 20:

  With reference either to the _mythos_ that Asia and Europa were both
  daughters of Okeanos, or to the historical fact that the Asiatic
  Ionians and the Dorians of Europe were both of the same Hellenic
  stock. The contrast between the long flowing robes of the Asiatic
  women, and the short, scanty kilt-like dress of those of Sparta must
  be borne in mind if we would see the picture in its completeness.

Footnote 21:

  Athenian pride is flattered with the thought that they had resisted
  while the Ionian Greeks had submitted all too willingly to the yoke of
  the Barbarian.

Footnote 22:

  Lustrations of this kind, besides their general significance in
  cleansing from defilement, had a special force as charms to turn aside
  dangers threatened by foreboding dreams. Comp. Aristoph. _Frogs_, v.
  1264; Persius, _Sat._ ii. 16.

Footnote 23:

  The political bearing of the passage as contrasting this
  characteristic of the despotism of Persia with the strict account to
  which all Athenian generals were subject, is, of course, unmistakable.

Footnote 24:

  The question, which seems to have rankled in the minds of the
  Athenians, is recorded as an historical fact, and put into the mouth
  of Dareios by Herodotos (v. 101). He had asked it on hearing that
  Sardis had been attacked and burnt by them.

Footnote 25:

  The words point to the silver mines of Laureion, which had been worked
  under Peisistratos, and of which this is the first mention in Greek
  literature.

Footnote 26:

  Once more the contrast between the Greek _hoplite_ and the light-armed
  archers of the invaders is dwelt upon. The next answer of the Chorus
  dwells upon the deeper contrast, then prominent in the minds of all
  Athenians, between their democratic freedom and the despotism of
  Persia. Comp. Herod. v. 78.

Footnote 27:

  The system of postal communications by means of couriers which Dareios
  had organised had made their speed in running proverbial (Herod. vii.
  97).

Footnote 28:

  With the characteristic contempt of a Greek for other races, Æschylos
  makes the Persians speak of themselves throughout as 'barbarians,'
  'barbaric.'

Footnote 29:

                Perhaps— “On planks that floated onward,”
                  or—    “On land and sea far spreading.”

Footnote 30:

  Possibly Salamis itself, as famed for the doves which were reared
  there as sacred to Aphrodite, but possibly also one of the smaller
  islands in the Saronic gulf, which the epithet would be enough to
  designate for an Athenian audience. The “coasts of the Sileni” in v.
  305 are identified by scholiasts with Salamis.

Footnote 31:

  Perhaps—“And ten of these selected as reserve.”

Footnote 32:

  As regards the number of the Persian ships, 1000 of average, and 207
  of special swiftness. Æschylos agrees with Herodotos, who gives the
  total of 1207. The latter, however, reckons the Greek ships not at
  310, but 378 (vii. 89, viii. 48).

Footnote 33:

  The fact that Athens had actually been taken, and its chief buildings
  plundered and laid waste, was, of course, not a pleasant one for the
  poet to dwell on. It could hardly, however, be entirely passed over,
  and this is the one allusion to it. In the truest sense it was still
  “unsacked:” it had not lost its most effective defence, its most
  precious treasure.

Footnote 34:

  As the story is told by Herodotos (vii. 75), this was Sikinnos, the
  slave of Themistocles, and the stratagem was the device of that
  commander to save the Greeks from the disgrace and ruin of a _sauve
  qui peut_ flight in all directions.

Footnote 35:

  The Greeks never beheaded their criminals, and the punishment is
  mentioned as being specially characteristic of the barbaric Persians.

Footnote 36:

  The Æginetans and Megarians, according to the account preserved by
  Diodoros (xi. 18), or the Lacedæmonians, according to Herodotos (viii.
  65).

Footnote 37:

  This may be meant to refer to the achievements of Ameinias of Pallene,
  who appears in the traditional life of Œschylos as his youngest
  brother.

Footnote 38:

  _Sc._, in Herod. viii. 60, the strait between Salamis and the
  mainland.

Footnote 39:

  Tunny-fishing has always been prominent in the occupations on the
  Mediterranean coasts, and the sailors who formed so large a part of
  every Athenian audience would be familiar with the process here
  described, of striking or harpooning them. Aristophanes (_Wasps_,
  1087) coins (or uses) the word “to tunny” (θυννάζω) to express the
  act. Comp. Herod. i. 62.

Footnote 40:

  _Sc._, Psyttaleia, lying between Salamis and the mainland. Pausanias
  (i. 36-82) describes it in his time as having no artistic shrine or
  statue, but full everywhere of roughly carved images of Pan, to whom
  the island was sacred. It lay just opposite the entrance to the
  Peiræos. The connexion of Pan with Salamis and its adjacent islands
  seems implied in Sophocles, _Aias_, 695.

Footnote 41:

  The manœuvre was, we learn from Herodotos (viii. 95), the work of
  Aristeides, the personal friend of Æschylos, and the statesman with
  whose policy he had most sympathy.

Footnote 42:

  The lines are noted as probably a spurious addition, by a weaker hand,
  to the text, as introducing surplusage, as inconsistent with
  Herodotos, and as faulty in their metrical structure.

Footnote 43:

  So Herodotos (viii. 115) describes them as driven by hunger to eat
  even grass and leaves.

Footnote 44:

  No trace of this passage over the frozen Strymon appears in Herodotos,
  who leaves the reader to imagine that it was crossed, as before, by a
  bridge. It is hardly, indeed, consistent with dramatic probability
  that the courier should have remained to watch the whole retreat of
  the defeated army; and on this and other grounds, the latter part of
  the speech has been rejected by some critics as a later addition.

Footnote 45:

  The Ionians, not of the Asiatic Ionia, but of Attica.

Footnote 46:

  Kychreia, the archaic name of Salamis.

Footnote 47:

  The ritual described is Hellenic rather than Persian, and takes its
  place (Soph. _Electr._ 836; Eurip. _Iphig. Taur._ 583; Homer, _Il._
  xxiii. 219) as showing what offerings were employed to soothe or call
  up the spirits of the dead. Comp. Pliny, _Hist. Nat._ xxx.

Footnote 48:

  The description obviously gives the state dress of the Persian kings.
  They alone wore the tiara erect. Xen. _Kyrop._ viii. 3, 13.

Footnote 49:

  Either that he has felt the measured tread of the mourners round his
  tomb, as they went wailing round and round, or that he has heard the
  rush of armies, and seen the plain tracked by chariot-wheels, and
  comes, not knowing all these things, to learn what it means.

Footnote 50:

  The words point to the widespread belief that when the souls of the
  dead were permitted to return to the earth, it was with strict
  limitations as to the time of their leave of absence.

Footnote 51:

  Perhaps—“I dread to speak the truth.”

Footnote 52:

  According to Herodotos (vii. 225) two brothers of Xerxes fell at
  Thermopylæ.

Footnote 53:

  As Herodotos (viii. 117) tells the story, the bridge had been broken
  by the tempest before Xerxes reached it.

Footnote 54:

  Probably Mardonios and Onomacritos the Athenian soothsayer are
  referred to, who, according to Herodotos (vii. 6, viii. 99) were the
  chief instigators of the expedition.

Footnote 55:

  Astyages, the father-in-law of Kyaxares and grandfather of Kyros. In
  this case Æschylos must be supposed to accept Xenophon's statement
  that Kyaxares succeeded to Astyages. Possibly, however, the Median may
  be Kyaxares I., the father of Astyages, and so the succession here
  would harmonise with that of Herodotos. The whole succession must be
  looked on as embodying the loose, floating notions of the Athenians as
  to the history of their great enemy, rather than as the result of
  inquiry.

Footnote 56:

  Stress is laid on the violence to which the Asiatic Ionians had
  succumbed, and their resistance to which distinguished them from the
  Lydians or Phrygians, whose submission had been voluntary.

Footnote 57:

  Mardos. Under this name we recognise the Pseudo-Smerdis of Herodotos
  (iii. 67), who, by restoring the dominion of the Median Magi, the
  caste to which he himself belonged, brought shame upon the Persians.

Footnote 58:

  Possibly another form of Intaphernes, who appears in Herodotos (iii.
  70) as one of the seven conspirators against the Magian
  Pseudo-Smerdis.

Footnote 59:

  The force of 300,000 men left in Greece under Mardonios (Herod. viii.
  113), afterwards defeated at Platæa.

Footnote 60:

  Comp. the speech of Mardonios urging his plan on Xerxes (Herod. viii.
  100).

Footnote 61:

  This was of course a popular topic with the Athenians, whose own
  temples had been outraged. But other sanctuaries also, the temples at
  Delphi and Abæ, had shared the same fate, and these sins against the
  Gods of Hellas were naturally connected in the thoughts of the Greeks
  with the subsequent disasters of the Persians. In Egypt these outrages
  had an iconoclastic character. In Athens they were a retaliation for
  the destruction of the temple at Sardis (Herod. v. 102).

Footnote 62:

  The reference to the prominent part taken by the Peloponnesian forces
  in the battle of Platæa is probably due to the political sympathies of
  the dramatist.

Footnote 63:

  The speech of Atossa is rejected by Paley, on internal grounds, as
  spurious.

Footnote 64:

  Apparently an allusion to the oracle given to Crœsos, that he, if he
  crossed the Halys, should destroy a great kingdom.

Footnote 65:

  The name originally given to the Echinades, a group of islands at the
  mouth of the Acheloös, was applied generically to all islands lying
  near the mouth of all great rivers, and here, probably, includes
  Imbros, Thasos, and Samothrakè.

Footnote 66:

  The geography is somewhat obscure, but the words seem to refer to the
  portion of the islands that are named as opposite (in a southerly
  direction) to the promontory of the Troad.

Footnote 67:

  Salamis in Kypros had been colonised by Teukros, the son of Aias, and
  had received its name in remembrance of the island in the Saronic
  Gulf.

Footnote 68:

  The Mariandynoi, a Paphlagonian tribe, conspicuous for their orgiastic
  worship of Adonis, had become proverbial for the wildness of their
  plaintive dirges.

Footnote 69:

  The name seems to have been an official title for some
  Inspector-General of the Army. Comp. Aristoph. _Acharn._ v. 92.

Footnote 70:

  As in the account which Herodotos gives (vii. 60) of the way in which
  the army of Xerxes was numbered, _sc._, by enclosing 10,000 men in a
  given space, and then filling it again and again till the whole army
  had passed through.

Footnote 71:

  Another reading gives—

                   “They are buried, they are buried.”

Footnote 72:

  Perhaps referring to the waggon-chariots in which the rider reclines
  at ease, either protected by a canopy, or, as in the Assyrian
  sculptures and perhaps in the East generally, overshadowed by a large
  umbrella which an eunuch holds over him.
