# THE SUPPLIANTS


                            DRAMATIS PERSONÆ

                  DANAOS
                  Herald
                  PELASGOS, _king of_ Argos
                  _Chorus of the daughters of_ DANAOS


_ARGUMENT.—When Io, after many wanderings, had found refuge in Egypt,
and having been touched by Zeus, had given birth to Epaphos, it came to
pass that he and his descendants ruled over the region of Canôpos, near
one of the seven mouths of Neilos. And in the fifth generation there
were two brothers, Danaos and Ægyptos, the sons of Belos, and the former
had fifty daughters and the latter fifty sons, and Ægyptos sought the
daughters of Danaos in marriage for his sons. And they, looking on the
marriage as unholy, and hating those who wooed them, took flight and
came to Argos, where Pelasgos then ruled as king, as to the land whence
Io, from whom they sprang, had come. And thither the sons of Ægyptos
followed them in hot pursuit._


      SCENE.—Argos, _the entrance of the gates. Statues of_ ZEUS,

          ARTEMIS, _and other Gods, placed against the walls_

  _Enter Chorus of the_ Daughters of DANAOS,[206] _in the dress of
        Egyptian women, with the boughs of suppliants in their hands,
        and fillets of white wool twisted round them, chanting as they
        move in procession to take up their position round the thymele_

 Zeus, the God of Suppliants, kindly
 Look on this our band of wanderers,
 That from banks at mouths of Neilos,
 Banks of finest sand, departed![207]
 Yea, we left the region sacred,
 Grassy plain on Syria's borders,[208]
 Not for guilt of blood to exile
 By our country's edict sentenced,
 But with free choice, loathing wedlock,
 Fleeing marriage-rites unholy
 With the children of Ægyptos.                                        10
 And our father Danaos, ruler,
 Chief of council, chief of squadrons,
 Playing moves on fortune's draught-board,[209]
 Chose what seemed the best of evils,
 Through the salt sea-waves to hasten,
 Steering to the land of Argos,
 Whence our race has risen to greatness;
 Sprung, so boasts it, from the heifer
 Whom the stinging gadfly harassed,
 By the touch of Zeus love-breathing:[210]
 And to what land more propitious
 Could we come than this before us,                                   20
 Holding in our hand the branches
 Suppliant, wreathed with white wool fillets?
 O State! O land! O water gleaming!
 Ye the high Gods, ye the awful,
 In the dark the graves still guarding;
 Thou too with them, Zeus Preserver,[211]
 Guardian of the just man's dwelling,
 Welcome with the breath of pity,
 Pity as from these shores wafted,
 Us poor women who are suppliants.
 And that swarm of men that follow,
 Haughty offspring of Ægyptos,                                        30
 Ere they set their foot among you
 On this silt-strown shore,[212]—oh, send them
         Seaward in their ship swift-rowing;
         There, with whirlwind tempest-driven,
         There, with lightning and with thunder,
         There, with blasts that bring the storm-rain,
         May they in the fierce sea perish,
         Ere they, cousin-brides possessing,
         Rest on marriage-beds reluctant,
         Which the voice of right denies them!


                               STROPHE I

 And now I call on him, the Zeus-sprung steer,[213]                   40
 Our true protector, far beyond the sea,
 Child of the heifer-foundress of our line,
         Who cropped the flowery mead,
 Born of the breath, and named from touch of Zeus.
         *And lo! the destined time
         *Wrought fully with the name,
 And she brought forth the “Touch-born,” Epaphos.


                             ANTISTROPHE I

 And now invoking him in grassy fields,                               50
 Where erst his mother strayed, to dwellers here
 Telling the tale of all her woes of old,
         I surest pledge shall give;
 And others, strange beyond all fancy's dream,
         Shall yet perchance be found;
         And in due course of time
 Shall men know clearly all our history.


                               STROPHE II

 And if some augur of the land be near,
         Hearing our piteous cry,
         Sure he will deem he hears
         The voice of Tereus' bride,[214]
         Piteous and sad of soul,
 The nightingale sore harassed by the kite.                           60


                             ANTISTROPHE II

 *For she, driven back from wonted haunts and streams,[215]
         Mourns with a strange new plaint
         The home that she has lost,
         And wails her son's sad doom,
         How he at her hand died,
 Meeting with evil wrath unmotherly;


                              STROPHE III

 E'en so do I, to wailing all o'er-given,
 In plaintive music of Ionian mood,[216]
 *Vex the soft cheek on Neilos' banks that bloomed,
         And heart that bursts in tears,
 And pluck the flowers of lamentations loud,
         Not without fear of friends,                                 70
         *Lest none should care to help
 This flight of mine from that mist-shrouded shore.


                            ANTISTROPHE III

 But, O ye Gods ancestral! hear my prayer,
 Look well upon the justice of our cause,
 Nor grant to youth to gain its full desire
         Against the laws of right,
 But with prompt hate of lust, our marriage bless.
         *Even for those who come
         As fugitives in war
 The altar serves as shield that Gods regard.


                               STROPHE IV

         May God good issue give![217]                                80
 And yet the will of Zeus is hard to scan:
         Through all it brightly gleams,
 E'en though in darkness and the gloom of chance
         For us poor mortals wrapt.


                             ANTISTROPHE IV

         Safe, by no fall tripped up,
 The full-wrought deed decreed by brow of Zeus;
         For dark with shadows stretch
 The pathways of the counsels of his heart,
         And difficult to see.


                               STROPHE V

 And from high-towering hopes He hurleth down                         90
 To utter doom the heir of mortal birth;
         Yet sets He in array
         No forces violent;
 All that Gods work is effortless and calm:
         Seated on holiest throne,
         Thence, though we know not how,
         He works His perfect will.


                             ANTISTROPHE V

 Ah, let him look on frail man's wanton pride,
 With which the old stock burgeons out anew,
         By love for me constrained,
         In counsels ill and rash,                                   100
 And in its frenzied, passionate resolve
         Finds goad it cannot shun;
         But in deceivèd hopes,
         Shall know, too late, its woe.


                               STROPHE VI

 Such bitter griefs, lamenting, I recount,
         With cries shrill, tearful, deep,
           (Ah woe! ah woe!)
 That strike the ear with mourner's woe-fraught cry.
 Though yet alive, I wail mine obsequies;
         Thee, Apian sea-girt bluff,[218]
         I greet (our alien speech
         Thou knowest well, O land,)                                 110
 And ofttimes fall, with rendings passionate,
 On robe of linen and Sidonian veil.


                             ANTISTROPHE VI

 But to the Gods, for all things prospering well,
         When death is kept aloof,
         Gifts votive come of right.
         Ah woe! Ah woe!
 Oh, troubles dark, and hard to understand!
 Ah, whither will these waters carry me?
         Thee, Apian sea-girt bluff,                                 120
         I greet (our alien speech
         Thou knowest well, O land,)
 And ofttimes fall, with rendings passionate,
 On robe of linen and Sidonian veil.


                              STROPHE VII

 The oar indeed and dwelling, timber-wrought,
 With sails of canvas, 'gainst the salt sea proof
         Brought me with favouring gales,
         By stormy wind unvexed;
 Nor have I cause for murmur. Issues good
 May He, the all-seeing Father, grant, that I,                       130
         Great seed of Mother dread,
 In time may 'scape, still maiden undefiled,
         My suitor's marriage-bed.


                            ANTISTROPHE VII

 And with a will that meets my will may She,
 The unstained child of Zeus, on me look down,
         *Our Artemis, who guards
         The consecrated walls;
 And with all strength, though hunted down, uncaught,
 May She, the Virgin, me a virgin free,                              140
         Great seed of Mother dread,
 That I may 'scape, still maiden undefiled,
         My suitor's marriage-bed.


                              STROPHE VIII

         But if this may not be,
         We, of swarth sun-burnt race,
 Will with our suppliant branches go to him,
         Zeus, sovereign of the dead,[219]
 The Lord that welcomes all that come to him,
         Dying by twisted noose                                      150
 If we the grace of Gods Olympian miss.
 By thine ire, Zeus, 'gainst Io virulent,
         The Gods' wrath seeks us out,
         And I know well the woe
 Comes from thy queen who reigns in heaven victorious;
         For after stormy wind
         The tempest needs must rage.


                            ANTISTROPHE VIII

         And then shall Zeus to words
         Unseemly be exposed,
 Having the heifer's offspring put to shame,                         160
         Whom he himself begat,
 And now his face averting from our prayers:
         Ah, may he hear on high,
 Yea, pitying look and hear propitiously!
 By thine ire, Zeus, 'gainst Io virulent,
         The Gods' wrath seeks us out,
         And I know well the woe
 Comes from thy queen, who reigns in heaven victorious;
         For after stormy wind                                       170
         The tempest needs must rage.

 _Danaos._ My children, we need wisdom; lo! ye came
 With me, your father wise and old and true,
 As guardian of your voyage. Now ashore,
 With forethought true I bid you keep my words,
 As in a tablet-book recording them:
 I see a dust, an army's voiceless herald,
 Nor are the axles silent as they turn;
 And I descry a host that bear the shield,
 And those that hurl the javelin, marching on
 With horses and with curvèd battle-cars.
 Perchance they are the princes of this land,                        180
 Come on the watch, as having news of us;
 But whether one in kindly mood, or hot
 With anger fierce, leads on this great array,
 It is, my children, best on all accounts
 To take your stand hard by this hill of Gods
 Who rule o'er conflicts.[220] Better far than towers
 Are altars, yea, a shield impenetrable.
 But with all speed approach the shrine of Zeus,
 The God of mercy, in your left hand holding
 The suppliants' boughs wool-wreathed, in solemn guise,[221]
 And greet our hosts as it is meet for us,                           190
 Coming as strangers, with all duteous words
 Kindly and holy, telling them your tale
 Of this your flight, unstained by guilt of blood;
 And with your speech, let mood not overbold,
 Nor vain nor wanton, shine from modest brow
 And calm, clear eye. And be not prompt to speak,
 Nor full of words; the race that dwelleth here
 Of this is very jealous:[222] and be mindful
 Much to concede; a fugitive thou art,
 A stranger and in want, and 'tis not meet
 That those in low estate high words should speak.

 _Chor._ My father, to the prudent prudently                  200
 Thou speakest, and my task shall be to keep
 Thy goodly precepts. Zeus, our sire, look on us!

 _Dan._ Yea, may He look with favourable eye!

 _Chor._ I fain would take my seat not far from thee.

                               [_Chorus moves to the altar not far from_
                                   DANAOS

 _Dan._ Delay not then; success go with your plan.

 _Chor._ Zeus, pity us with sorrow all but crushed!

 _Dan._ If He be willing, all shall turn out well.

 _Chor._ .      .      .      .      .

 _Dan._ Invoke ye now the mighty bird of Zeus.[223]

 _Chor._ We call the sun's bright rays to succour us.

 _Dan._ Apollo too, the holy, in that He,                     210
 A God, has tasted exile from high heaven.[224]

 _Chor._ Knowing that fate, He well may feel for men.

 _Dan._ So may He feel, and look on us benignly!

 _Chor._ Whom of the Gods shall I besides invoke?

 _Dan._ I see this trident here, a God's great symbol.[225]

 _Chor._ Well hath He brought us, well may He receive!

 _Dan._ Here too is Hermes,[226] as the Hellenes know him.

 _Chor._ To us, as free, let Him good herald prove.

 _Dan._ Yea, and the common shrine of all these Gods
 Adore ye, and in holy precincts sit,
 Like swarms of doves in fear of kites your kinsmen,                 220
 Foes of our blood, polluters of our race.
 How can bird prey on bird and yet be pure?
 And how can he be pure who seeks in marriage
 Unwilling bride from father too unwilling?
 Nay, not in Hades' self, shall he, vain fool,
 Though dead, 'scape sentence, doing deeds like this;
 For there, as men relate, a second Zeus[227]
 Judges men's evil deeds, and to the dead
 Assigns their last great penalties. Look up,
 And take your station here, that this your cause
 May win its way to a victorious end.

       _Enter the_ KING _on his chariot, followed by_ Attendants

 _King._ Whence comes this crowd, this non-Hellenic band,     230
 In robes and raiment of barbaric fashion
 So gorgeously attired, whom now we speak to?
 This woman's dress is not of Argive mode,
 Nor from the climes of Hellas. How ye dared,
 Without a herald even or protector,
 Yea, and devoid of guides too, to come hither
 Thus boldly, is to me most wonderful.
 And yet these boughs, as is the suppliant's wont,
 Are set by you before the Gods of conflicts:
 By this alone will Hellas guess aright.
 Much more indeed we might have else conjectured,                    240
 Were there no voice to tell me on the spot.

 _Chor._ Not false this speech of thine about our garb;
 But shall I greet thee as a citizen,
 Or bearing Hermes' rod, or city ruling?[228]

 _King._ Nay, for that matter, answer thou and speak
 Without alarm. Palæchthon's son am I,
 Earth-born, the king of this Pelasgic land;
 And named from me, their king,[229] as well might be,
 The race Pelasgic reaps our country's fruits;
 *And all the land through which the Strymon pours        250
 Its pure, clear waters to the West I rule;
 And as the limits of my realm I mark
 The land of the Perrhæbi, and the climes
 Near the Pæonians, on the farther side
 Of Pindos, and the Dodonæan heights;[230]
 And the sea's waters form its bounds. O'er all
 Within these coasts I govern; and this plain,
 The Apian land, itself has gained its name
 Long since from one who as a healer lived;[231]
 For Apis, coming from Naupactian land
 That lies beyond the straits, Apollo's son,
 Prophet and healer, frees this land of ours                         260
 From man-destroying monsters, which the soil,
 Polluted with the guilt of blood of old,
 By anger of the Gods, brought forth,—fierce plagues,
 The dragon-brood's dread, unblest company;
 And Apis, having for this Argive land
 Duly wrought out his saving surgery,
 Gained his reward, remembered in our prayers;
 And thou, this witness having at my hands,
 May'st tell thy race at once, and further speak;
 Yet lengthened speech our city loveth not.

 _Chor._ Full short and clear our tale. We boast that we
 Are Argives in descent, the children true                           270
 Of the fair, fruitful heifer. And all this
 Will I by what I speak show firm and true.

 _King._ Nay, strangers, what ye tell is past belief
 For me to hear, that ye from Argos spring;
 For ye to Libyan women are most like,[232]
 And nowise to our native maidens here.
 Such race might Neilos breed, and Kyprian mould,
 Like yours, is stamped by skilled artificers
 On women's features; and I hear that those
 Of India travel upon camels borne,                                  280
 Swift as the horse, yet trained as sumpter-mules,
 E'en those who as the Æthiops' neighbours dwell.
 And had ye borne the bow, I should have guessed,
 Undoubting, ye were of th' Amâzon's tribe,
 Man-hating, flesh-devouring. Taught by you,
 I might the better know how this can be,
 That your descent and birth from Argos come.

 _Chor._ They tell of one who bore the temple-keys
 Of Hera, Io, in this Argive land.

 _King._ So was't indeed, and wide the fame prevails:
 And was it said that Zeus a mortal loved?                           290

 _Chor._ And that embrace was not from Hera hid.

 _King._ What end had then these strifes of sovereign Ones?

 _Chor._ The Argive goddess made the maid a heifer.

 _King._ Did Zeus that fair-horned heifer still approach?

 _Chor._ So say they, fashioned like a wooing steer.

 _King._ How acted then the mighty spouse of Zeus?

 _Chor._ She o'er the heifer set a guard all-seeing.

 _King._ What herdsman strange, all-seeing, speak'st thou of?

 _Chor._ Argos, the earth-born, him whom Hermes slew.         300

 _King._ What else then wrought she on the ill-starred heifer?

 _Chor._ She sent a stinging gadfly to torment her.
 [Those who near Neilos dwell an _æstros_ call it.]

 _King._ Did she then drive her from her country far?

 _Chor._ All that thou say'st agrees well with our tale.

 _King._ And did she to Canôbos go, and Memphis?

 _Chor._ Zeus with his touch, an offspring then begets.

 _King._ What Zeus-born calf that heifer claims as mother?

 _Chor._ *He from that touch which freed named Epaphos.310

 _King._ [_What offspring then did Epaphos beget?_][233]

 _Chor._ Libya, that gains her fame from greatest land.

 _King._ What other offspring, born of her, dost tell of?

 _Chor._ Sire of my sire here, Belos, with two sons.

 _King._ Tell me then now the name of yonder sage.

 _Chor._ Danaos, whose brother boasts of fifty sons.

 _King._ Tell me his name, too, with ungrudging speech.

 _Chor._ Ægyptos: knowing now our ancient stock,
 Take heed thou bid thine Argive suppliants rise.

 _King._ Ye seem, indeed, to make your ancient claim
 To this our country good: but how came ye                           320
 To leave your father's house? What chance constrained you?

 _Chor._ O king of the Pelasgi, manifold
 Are ills of mortals, and thou could'st not find
 The self-same form of evil anywhere.
 Who would have said that this unlooked-for flight
 Would bring to Argos race once native here,
 Driving them forth in hate of wedlock's couch?

 _King._ What seek'st thou then of these the Gods of conflicts,
 Holding your wool-wreathed branches newly-plucked?

 _Chor._ That I serve not Ægyptos' sons as slave.

 _King._ Speak'st thou of some old feud, or breach of right?  330

 _Chor._ Nay, who'd find fault with master that one loved?

 _King._ Yet thus it is that mortals grow in strength.[234]

 _Chor._ True; when men fail, 'tis easy to desert them.

 _King._ How then to you may I act reverently?

 _Chor._ Yield us not up unto Ægyptos' sons.

 _King._ Hard boon thou ask'st, to wage so strange a war.

 _Chor._ Nay, Justice champions those who fight with her.

 _King._ Yes, if her hand was in it from the first.

 _Chor._ Yet reverence thou the state-ship's stern thus wreathed.[235]

 _King._ I tremble as I see these seats thus shadowed.        340


                               STROPHE I

 _Chor._ Dread is the wrath of Zeus, the God of suppliants:
         Son of Palæchthon, hear;
 Hear, O Pelasgic king, with kindly heart.
 Behold me suppliant, exile, wanderer,
         *Like heifer chased by wolves
         Upon the lofty crags,
         Where, trusting in her strength,
         She lifteth up her voice
 And to the shepherd tells her tale of grief.

 _King._ I see, o'ershadowed with the new-plucked boughs,
 *Bent low, a band these Gods of conflict own;
 And may our dealings with these home-sprung strangers               350
 Be without peril, nor let strife arise
 To this our country for unlooked-for chance
 And unprovided! This our State wants not.


                             ANTISTROPHE I

 _Chor._ Yea, may that Law that guards the suppliant's right
         Free this our flight from harm,
 Law, sprung from Zeus, supreme Apportioner,
 But thou, [_to the King_,] though old, from me, though younger, learn:
         If thou a suppliant pity
         Thou ne'er shall penury know,
         So long as Gods receive
         Within their sacred shrines
 Gifts at the hands of worshipper unstained.

 _King._ It is not at my hearth ye suppliant sit;
 But if the State be as a whole defiled,                             360
 Be it the people's task to work the cure.
 I cannot pledge my promise to you first
 Ere I have counselled with my citizens.[236]


                               STROPHE II

 _Chor._ Thou art the State—yea, thou the commonwealth,
         Chief lord whom none may judge;
 'Tis thine to rule the country's altar-hearth,
 With the sole vote of thy prevailing nod;
         And thou on throne of state,
         Sole-sceptred in thy sway,
 Bringest each matter to its destined end;
         Shun thou the curse of guilt.

 _King._ Upon my foes rest that dread curse of guilt!         370
 Yet without harm I cannot succour you,
 Nor gives it pleasure to reject your prayers.
 In a sore strait am I; fear fills my soul
 To take the chance, to do or not to do.


                             ANTISTROPHE II

 _Chor._ Look thou on Him who looks on all from heaven,
         Guardian of suffering men
 Who, worn with toil, unto their neighbours come
 As suppliants, and receive not justice due:
         For these the wrath of Zeus,
         Zeus, the true suppliant's God,
 Abides, by wail of sufferer unappeased.                             380

 _King._ Yet if Ægyptos' sons have claim on thee
 By their State's law, asserting that they come
 As next of kin, who dare oppose their right?
 Thou must needs plead that by thy laws at home
 They over thee have no authority.[237]


                              STROPHE III

 _Chor._ Ah! may I ne'er be captive to the might
         Of males! Where'er the stars
 Are seen in heaven, I track my way in flight,
 As refuge from a marriage that I hate.
         But thou, make Right thy friend,
 And honour what the Gods count pure and true.                       390

 _King._ Hard is the judgment: choose not me as judge.
 But, as I said before, I may not act
 Without the people, sovereign though I be,
 Lest the crowd say, should aught fall out amiss,
 “In honouring strangers, thou the State did'st ruin.”


                            ANTISTROPHE III

 _Chor._ Zeus, the great God of kindred, in these things
         Watches o'er both of us,
 Holding an equal scale, and fitly giving
 To the base evil, to the righteous blessing.
         Why, when these things are set
 In even balance, fear'st thou to do right?                          400

 _King._ Deep thought we need that brings deliverance,
 That, like a diver, mine eye too may plunge
 Clear-seeing to the depths, not wine-bedrenched,
 That these things may be harmless to the State,
 And to ourselves may issue favourably:
 That neither may the strife make you its prey,
 Nor that we give you up, who thus are set
 Near holy seat of Gods, and so bring in
 To dwell with us the Avenger terrible,
 God that destroyeth, who not e'en in Hades                          410
 Gives freedom to the dead. Say, think ye not
 That there is need of counsel strong to save?


                               STROPHE I

 _Chor._ Take heed to it, and be
 Friend to the stranger wholly faithful found;
         Desert not thou the poor,
 Driven from afar by godless violence.


                             ANTISTROPHE I

         See me not dragged away,
 O thou that rul'st the land! from seat of Gods:
         Know thou men's wanton pride,                               420
 And guard thyself against the wrath of Zeus.


                               STROPHE II

 Endure not thou to see thy suppliant,
         Despite of law, torn off,
 As horses by their frontlets, from the forms
         Of sculptured deities,
 Nor yet the outrage of their wanton hands,
         Seizing these broidered robes.


                             ANTISTROPHE II

 For know thou well, whichever course thou take,
         Thy sons and all thy house
 *Must pay in war the debt that Justice claims,
         Proportionate in kind.                                      430
 Lay well to heart these edicts, wise and true,
         Given by great Zeus himself.

 _King._ Well then have I thought o'er it. To this point
 Our ship's course drives. Fierce war we needs must risk
 Either with these (_pointing to the Gods_) or those. Set fast and firm
 Is this as is the ship tight wedged in stocks;
 And without trouble there's no issue out.
 For wealth indeed, were our homes spoiled of that,
 There might come other, thanks to Zeus the Giver,
 More than the loss, and filling up the freight;                     440
 And if the tongue should aim its adverse darts,
 Baleful and over-stimulant of wrath,
 There might be words those words to heal and soothe.
 But how to blot the guilt of kindred blood,
 This needs a great atonement—many victims
 Falling to many Gods—to heal the woe.
 *I take my part, and turn aside from strife;
 And I far rather would be ignorant
 Than wise, forecasting evil. May the end,
 Against my judgment, show itself as good!

 _Chor._ Hear, then, the last of all our pleas for pity.

 _King._ I hear; speak on. It shall not 'scape my heed.       450

 _Chor._ Girdles I have, and zones that bind my robes.

 _King._ Such things are fitting for a woman's state.

 _Chor._ With these then, know, as good and rare device....

 _King._ Nay, speak. What word is this thou'lt utter now?

 _Chor._ Unless thou giv'st our band thy plighted word....

 _King._ What wilt thou do with this device of girdles?

 _Chor._ With tablets new these sculptures we'll adorn.

 _King._ Thou speak'st a riddle. Make thy meaning plain.

 _Chor._ Upon these Gods we'll hang ourselves at once.

 _King._ I hear a word which pierces to the heart.            460

 _Chor._ Thou see'st our meaning. Eyes full clear I've given.

 _King._ Lo then! in many ways sore troubles come.
 A host of evils rushes like a flood;
 A sea of woe none traverse, fathomless,
 This have I entered; haven there is none.
 For if I fail to do this work for you,
 Thou tellest of defilement unsurpassed;[238]
 And if for thee against Ægyptos' sons,
 Thy kindred, I before my city's walls
 In conflict stand, how can there fail to be
 A bitter loss, to stain the earth with blood                        470
 Of man for woman's sake? And yet I needs
 Must fear the wrath of Zeus, the suppliant's God;
 That dread is mightiest with the sons of men.
 Thou, then, O aged father of these maidens!
 Taking forthwith these branches in thine arms,
 Lay them on other altars of the Gods
 Our country worships, that the citizens
 May all behold this token of thy coming,
 And about me let no rash speech be dropped;
 For 'tis a people prompt to blame their rulers.
 And then perchance some one beholding them,                         480
 And pitying, may wax wrathful 'gainst the outrage
 Of that male troop, and with more kindly will
 The people look on you; for evermore
 Men all wish well unto the weaker side.

 _Dan._ This boon is counted by us of great price,
 To find a patron proved so merciful.
 And thou, send with us guides to lead us on,
 And tell us how before their shrines to find
 The altars of the Gods that guard the State,
 *And holy places columned round about;
 And safety for us, as the town we traverse.
 Not of like fashion is our features' stamp;                         490
 For Neilos rears not race like Inachos.[239]
 Take heed lest rashness lead to bloodshed here;
 Ere now, unknowing, men have slain their friends.

 _King_ (_to Attendants_). Go then, my men; full well the stranger
    speaks;
 And lead him where the city's altars stand,
 The seats of Gods; and see ye talk not much
 To passers-by as ye this traveller lead,
 A suppliant at the altar-hearth of Gods.

                                       [_Exeunt_ DANAOS _and Attendants_

 _Chor._ Thou speak'st to him; and may he go as bidden!
 But what shall I do? What hope giv'st thou me?

 _King._ Leave here those boughs, the token of your grief.    500

 _Chor._ Lo! here I leave them at thy beck and word.

 _King._ Now turn thy steps towards this open lawn.

 _Chor._ What shelter gives a lawn unconsecrate?[240]

 _King._ We will not yield thee up to birds of prey.

 _Chor._ Nay, but to foes far worse than fiercest dragons.

 _King._ Good words should come from those who good have heard.

 _Chor._ No wonder they wax hot whom fear enthrals.

 _King._ But dread is still for rulers all unmeet.

 _Chor._ Do thou then cheer our soul by words and deeds.

 _King._ Nay, no long time thy sire will leave thee lorn;     510
 And I, all people of the land convening,
 Will the great mass persuade to kindly words;
 And I will teach thy father what to say.
 Wherefore remain and ask our country's Gods,
 With suppliant prayers, to grant thy soul's desire,
 And I will go in furtherance of thy wish:
 Sweet Suasion follow us, and Fortune good! [_Exit_


                               STROPHE I

       _Chor._ O King of kings! and blest
       Above all blessed ones,
 And Power most mighty of the mightiest!
       O Zeus, of high estate!                                       520
       Hear thou and grant our prayer!
 Drive thou far off the wantonness of men,
       The pride thou hatest sore,
 And in the pool of darkling purple hue
 Plunge thou the woe that comes in swarthy barque.


                             ANTISTROPHE I

         Look on the women's cause;
         Recall the ancient tale,
 Of one whom Thou did'st love in time of old,
         The mother of our race:
         Remember it, O Thou
 Who did'st on Io lay thy mystic touch.
         We boast that we are come
 Of consecrated land the habitants,                                  530
 And from this land by lineage high descended.


                               STROPHE II

         Now to the ancient track,
         Our mother's, I have passed,
 The flowery meadow-land where she was watched,—
         The pastures of the herd,
 Whence Io, by the stinging gadfly driven,
         Flees, of her sense bereft,
 Passing through many tribes of mortal men;
         And then by Fate's decree
         Crossing the billowy straits,
 On either side she leaves a continent.[241]                         540


                             ANTISTROPHE II

         Now through the Asian land
         She hastens o'er and o'er,
 Right through the Phrygian fields where feed the flocks;
         And passes Teuthras' fort,
 Owned by the Mysians,[242] and the Lydian plains;
         And o'er Kilikian hills,
 And those of far Pamphylia rushing on,
         By ever-flowing streams,
         On to the deep, rich lands,
 And Aphrodite's home in wheat o'erflowing.[243]


                              STROPHE III

 And so she cometh, as that herdsman winged                          550
         Pierces with sharpest sting,
 To holy plain all forms of life sustaining,
         Fields that are fed from snows,[244]
 Which Typhon's monstrous strength has traversed,[245]
         And unto Neilos' streams,
         By sickly taint untouched,[246]
 Still maddened with her toil of ignominy,
 By torturing stings driven on, great Hera's frenzied slave.


                            ANTISTROPHE III

 And those who then the lands inhabited,
         Quivered with pallid fear,                                  560
 That filled their soul at that unwonted marvel,
         Seeing that monstrous shape,
         The human joined with brute,
 Half heifer, and half form of woman fair:[247]
         And sore amazed were they.
         Who was it then that soothed
 Poor Io, wandering in her sore affright,
 Driven on, and ever on, by gadfly's maddening sting?


                               STROPHE IV

         Zeus, Lord of endless time
         [Was seen All-working then;]
 He, even He, for by his sovereign might
 That works no ill, was she from evil freed;                         570
         And by his breath divine
 She findeth rest, and weeps in floods of tears
         Her sorrowing shame away;
         And with new burden big,
         Not falsely 'Zeus-born' named,
 She bare a son that grew in faultless growth,


                             ANTISTROPHE IV

         Prosperous through long, long years;
 And so the whole land shouts with one accord,
 “Lo, a race sprung from him, the Lord of life,
         In very deed, Zeus-born!                                    580
 Who else had checked the plagues that Hera sent?”
         This is the work of Zeus:
         And speaking of our race
         That sprang from Epaphos
 As such, thou would'st not fail to hit the mark.


                               STROPHE V

 Which of the Gods could I with right invoke
         As doing juster deeds?
 He is our Father, author of our life,
 The King whose right hand worketh all his will,
 Our line's great author, in his counsels deep
         Recording things of old,
 Directing all his plans, the great work-master, Zeus.


                             ANTISTROPHE V

 For not as subject hastening at the beck
         Of strength above his own,[248]
 Reigns He subordinate to mightier powers;                           590
 Nor does He pay his homage from below,
 While One sits throned in majesty above;[249]
         Act is for him as speech,
 To hasten what his teeming mind resolves.

                           _Re-enter_ DANAOS

 _Dan._ Be of good cheer, my children. All goes well
 With those who dwell here, and the people's voice
 Hath passed decrees full, firm, irrevocable.

 _Chor._ Hail, aged sire, that tell'st me right good news!
 But say with what intent the vote hath passed,
 And on which side the people's hands prevail.

 _Dan._ The Argives have decreed without division,
 So that my aged mind grew young again;                              600
 For in full congress, with their right hands raised
 Rustled the air as they decreed their vote
 That we should sojourn in their land as free,
 Free from arrest, and with asylum rights;
 And that no native here nor foreigner
 Should lead us off; and, should he venture force,
 That every citizen who gave not help
 Dishonoured should be driven to exile forth.
 Such counsel giving, the Pelasgian King                             610
 Gained their consent, proclaiming that great wrath
 Of Zeus the God of suppliants ne'er would let
 The city wax in fatness,—warning them
 That double guilt[250] upon the State would come,
 Touching at once both guests and citizens,
 The food and sustenance of sore disease
 That none could heal. And then the Argive host,
 Hearing these things, decreed by show of hands,
 Not waiting for the herald's proclamation,
 So it should be. They heard, indeed, the crowd
 Of those Pelasgi, all the winning speech,
 The well-turned phrases cunning to persuade;
 But it was Zeus that brought the end to pass.

 _Chor._ Come then, come, let us speak for Argives
         Prayers that are good for good deeds done;                  620
         Zeus, who o'er all strangers watches,
         May He regard with his praise and favour
 The praise that comes from the lips of strangers,
 *And guide in all to a faultless issue.


                               STROPHE I

 _Half-Chor. A._ Now, now, at last, ye Gods of Zeus begotten,[251]
 Hear, as I pour my prayers upon their race,
 That ne'er may this Pelasgic city raise
 From out its flames the joyless cry of War,
         War, that in other fields
         Reapeth his human crop:
         For they have mercy shown,
         And passed their kind decree,                               630
 Pitying this piteous flock, the suppliants of great Zeus.


                             ANTISTROPHE I

 They did not take their stand with men 'gainst women
 Casting dishonour on their plea for help,
 *But looked to Him who sees and works from heaven,
 *Full hard to war with. Yea, what house could bear
         To see Him on its roof
         Casting pollution there?[252]
         Sore vexing there he sits.
         Yes, they their kin revere,
         Suppliants of holiest Zeus;                                 640
 Therefore with altars pure shall they the Gods delight.


                               STROPHE II

 Therefore from faces by our boughs o'ershadowed[253]
 Let prayers ascend in emulous eagerness:
         Ne'er may dark pestilence
         This State of men bereave;
         May no fierce party strife
 Pollute these plains with native carcases;
         And may the bloom of youth
         Be with them still uncropt;
 And ne'er may Aphrodite's paramour,                                 650
         Ares the scourge of men,
         Mow down their blossoms fair!


                             ANTISTROPHE II

 And let the altars tended by the old
 *Blaze with the gifts of men with hoary hairs;
         So may the State live on
         In full prosperity!
         Let them great Zeus adore,
 The strangers' God, the one Supreme on high,
         By venerable law
         Ordering the course of fate.
 And next we pray that ever more and more
         Earth may her tribute bear,
 And Artemis as Hecate preside[254]
         O'er woman's travail-pangs.                                 660


                              STROPHE III

 Let no destroying strife come on, invading
         This city to lay waste,
         Setting in fierce array
         War, with its fruit of tears,
         Lyreless and danceless all,
         And cry of people's wrath;
         And may the swarm of plagues,
         Loathly and foul to see,
 Abide far off from these our citizens,
 And that Lykeian king, may He be found
         Benignant to our youth![255]


                            ANTISTROPHE III

 And Zeus, may He, by his supreme decree,                            670
         Make the earth yield her fruits
         Through all the seasons round,
         And grant a plenteous brood
         Of herds that roam the fields!
         May Heaven all good gifts pour,
         And may the voice of song
         Ascend o'er altar shrines,
         Unmarred by sounds of ill!
 And let the voice that loves with lyre to blend
 Go forth from lips of blameless holiness,
         In accents of great joy!


                               STROPHE IV

 *And may the rule in which the people share
 Keep the State's functions as in perfect peace,
         E'en that which sways the crowd,
         *Which sways the commonwealth,                   680
         By counsels wise and good;
 And to the strangers and the sojourners
 May they grant rights that rest on compacts sure,
         Ere War is roused to arms,
         So that no trouble come!


                             ANTISTROPHE IV

 And the great Gods who o'er this country watch,
 May they adore them in the land They guard,
         With rites of sacrifice,
         And troops with laurel boughs,
         As did our sires of old!
 For thus to honour those who gave us life,
 This stands as one of three great laws on high,[256]
         Written as fixed and firm,
         The laws of Right revered.

 _Dan._ I praise these seemly prayers, dear children mine.    690
 But fear ye not, if I your father speak
 Words that are new, and all unlooked-for by you;
 For from this station to the suppliant given
 I see the ship; too clear to be mistaken
 The swelling sails, the bulwark's coverings,
 And prow with eyes that scan the onward way,[257]
 But too obedient to the steerman's helm,
 Being, as it is, unfriendly. And the men
 Who sail in her with swarthy limbs are seen,
 In raiment white conspicuous. And I see                             700
 Full clear the other ships that come to help;
 And this as leader, putting in to shore,
 Furling its sails, is rowed with equal stroke.
 'Tis yours, with mood of calm and steadfast soul,
 To face the fact, and not to slight the Gods.
 And I will come with friends and advocates;
 For herald, it may be, or embassy,
 May come, and wish to seize and bear you off,
 Grasping their prey. But nought of this shall be;
 Fear ye not them. It were well done, however,
 If we should linger in our help, this succour                       710
 In no wise to forget. Take courage then;
 In their own time and at the appointed day,
 Whoever slights the Gods shall pay for it.


                               STROPHE I

 _Chor._ I fear, my father, since the swift-winged ships
 Are come, and very short the time that's left.
 A shuddering anguish makes me sore afraid,
 Lest small the profit of my wandering flight.
         I faint, my sire, for fear.

 _Dan._ My children, since the Argives' vote is passed,
 Take courage: they will fight for thee, I know.                     720


                             ANTISTROPHE I

 _Chor._ Hateful and wanton are Ægyptos' sons,
 Insatiable of conflict, and I speak
 To one who knows them. They in timbered ships,
 Dark-eyed, have sailed in wrath that hits its mark,
         With great and swarthy host.

 _Dan._ Yet many they shall find whose arms are tanned
 In the full scorching of the noontide heat.[258]


                               STROPHE II

 _Chor._ Leave me not here alone, I pray thee, father!
 Alone, a woman is as nought, and war
 Is not for her. Of over-subtle mind,
 And subtle counsel in their souls impure,                           730
 Like ravens, e'en for altars caring not,—
         Such, such in soul are they.

 _Dan._ That would work well indeed for us, my children,
 Should they be foes to Gods as unto thee.


                             ANTISTROPHE II

 _Chor._ No reverence for these tridents or the shrines
 Of Gods, my father, will restrain their hands:
 Full stout of heart, of godless mood unblest,
 Fed to the full, and petulant as dogs,
 And for the voice of high Gods caring not,—
         Such, such in soul are they.

 _Dan._ Nay, the tale runs that wolves prevail o'er dogs;     740
 And byblos fruit excels not ear of corn.[259]

 _Chor._ But since their minds are as the minds of brutes,
 Restless and vain, we must beware of force.

 _Dan._ Not rapid is the getting under weigh
 Of naval squadron, nor their anchoring,
 Nor the safe putting into shore with cables.
 Nor have the shepherds of swift ships quick trust
 In anchor-fastenings, most of all, as now,
 When coming to a country havenless;
 And when the sun has yielded to the night,
 That night brings travail to a pilot wise,                          750
 [Though it be calm and all the waves sleep still;]
 So neither can this army disembark
 Before the ship is safe in anchorage.
 And thou beware lest in thy panic fear
 Thou slight the Gods whom thou hast called to help.
 The city will not blame your messenger,
 Old though he be, being young in clear-voiced thought.      _Exit_


                               STROPHE I

 _Chor._ Ah, me! thou land of jutting promontory
           Which justly all revere,
 What lies before us? Where in Apian land
           Shall we a refuge find,
 If still there be dark hiding anywhere?
           Ah! that I were as smoke
           That riseth full and black
           Nigh to the clouds of Zeus,                               760
 Or soaring up on high invisible,
           Like dust that vanishes,
 Pass out of being with no help from wings!


                             ANTISTROPHE I

 *E'en so the ill admits not now of flight;
           My heart in dark gloom throbs;
 My father's work as watcher brings me low;
           I faint for very fear,
 And I would fain find noose that bringeth death,
           In twisted cordage hung,
           Before the man I loathe
           Draws near this flesh of mine:                            770
 Sooner than that may Hades rule o'er me
           Sleeping the sleep of death!


                               STROPHE II

 Ah, might I find a place in yon high vault,
 Where the rain-clouds are passing into snow,
           Or lonely precipice
           Whose summit none can see,
           Rock where the vulture haunts,
 Witness for me of my abysmal fall,
 Before the marriage that will pierce my heart
           Becomes my dreaded doom!


                             ANTISTROPHE II

 I shrink not from the thought of being the prey                     780
 Of dogs and birds that haunt the country round;
           For death shall make me free
           From ills all lamentable:
           Yea, let death rather come
 Than the worse doom of hated marriage-bed!
 What other refuge now remains for me
           That marriage to avert?


                              STROPHE III

           Yea, to the Gods raise thou
           Cloud-piercing, wailing cry
           Of songs and litanies,
 Prevailing, working freedom out for me:                             790
           And thou, O Father, look,
           Look down upon the strife,
 With glance of wrath against our enemies
         From eyes that see the right;
 With pity look on us thy suppliants,
 O Lord of Earth, O Zeus omnipotent!


                            ANTISTROPHE III

         For lo! Ægyptos' house,
         In pride intolerable,
         O'er-masculine in mood,
 Pursuing me in many a winding course,
         Poor wandering fugitive,
         With loud and wild desires,
 Seek in their frenzied violence to seize:                           800
         But thine is evermore
 The force that turns the balance of the scale:
 What comes to mortal men apart from Thee?

         Ah! ah! ah! ah!
 *Here on the land behold the ravisher
         Who comes on us by sea!
 *Ah, may'st thou perish, ravisher, ere thou
         Hast stopped or landed here!
 *I utter cry of wailing loud and long,
 *I see them work the prelude of their crimes,
         Their crimes of violence.
           Ah! ah! Ah me!                                            810
 Haste in your flight for help!
 The mighty ones are waxing fat and proud,
 By sea and land alike intolerable.
 Be thou, O King, our bulwark and defence!

         _Enter_ Herald _of the sons of_ ÆGYPTOS, _advancing to
                        the daughters of_ DANAOS

 _Her._ Haste, haste with all your speed unto the barque.

 _Chor._ Tearing of hair, yea, tearing now will come,
         And print of nails in flesh,
         And smiting off of heads,
         With murderous stream of blood.

 _Her._ Haste, haste ye, to that barque that yonder lies,     820
 Ye wretches, curse on you.


                               STROPHE I

         _Chor._ Would thou had'st met thy death
         Where the salt waves wildly surge,
         Thou with thy lordly pride,
         In nail-compacted ship:
 *Lo! they will smite thee, weltering in thy blood,
         *And drive thee to thy barque.

 _Her._ I bid you cease perforce, the cravings wild
         Of mind to madness given.
         Ho there! what ho! I say;                                   830
 Give up those seats, and hasten to the ship:
 I reverence not what this State honoureth.


                             ANTISTROPHE I

       _Chor._ Ah, I may ne'er again
 Behold the stream where graze the goodly kine,
       Nourished and fed by which[260]
 The blood of cattle waxes strong and full!
       *As with a native's right,
       *And one of old descent,
 I keep, old man, my seat, my seat, I say.

 _Her._ Nay, in a ship, a ship them shalt soon go,            840
         With or without thy will,
         By force, I say, by force:
 Come, come, provoke not evils terrible,
         Falling by these my hands.


                               STROPHE II

 _Chor._ Ah me! ah me!
 Would thou may'st perish with no hand to help,
         Crossing the sea's wide plain,
         In wanderings far and wide,
 Where Sarpedonian sand-bank[261] spreads its length,
         Driven by the sweeping blasts!

 _Her._ Sob thou, and howl, and call upon the Gods:           850
 Thou shalt not 'scape that barque from Ægypt come,
 Though thou should'st pour a bitterer strain of grief.


                             ANTISTROPHE II

 _Chor._ Woe! woe! Ah woe! ah woe,
 For this foul wrong! Thou utterest fearful things;
 *Thou art too bold and insolent of speech.
 *May mighty Nile that reared thee turn away
         Thy wanton pride and lust
         That we behold it not!

 _Her._ I bid you go to yon ship double-prowed,[262]
 With all your speed. Let no one lag behind;
 But little shall my grasp your ringlets spare.                      860

                               [_Seizes on the leader of the Suppliants_


                              STROPHE III

 _Chor._ Ah me! my father, ah!
 The help of holiest statues turns to woe;
         He leads me to the sea,
         With motion spider-like,
 Or like a dream, a dark and dismal dream,
         Ah woe! ah woe! ah woe!
 O mother Earth! O Earth! O mother mine!
         Avert that cry of fear,
 O Zeus, thou king! O son of mother Earth!

 _Her._ Nay, I fear not the Gods they worship here;
 They did not rear nor lead me up to age.                            870


                            ANTISTROPHE III

 _Chor._ Near me he rages now,
        ·       ·       ·       ·       ·
         That biped snake,
 And like a viper bites me by the foot.
         Oh, woe is me! woe! woe!
 O mother Earth! O Earth! O mother mine!
         Avert that cry of fear,
 O Zeus, thou king! O son of mother Earth!

 _Her._ If some one yield not, and to yon ship go,
 The hand that tears her tunic will not pity.


                               STROPHE IV

 _Chor._ Ho! rulers of the State!                             880
         Ye princes! I am seized.

 _Her._ It seems, since ye are slow to hear my words,
 That I shall have to drag you by the hair.


                             ANTISTROPHE IV

 _Chor._ We are undone, undone!
 We suffer, prince, unlooked-for outrages,

 _Her._ Full many princes, heirs of great Ægyptos,
 Ye soon shall see. Take courage; ye shall have
 No cause to speak of anarchy as there.

                _Enter_ KING _followed by his_ Bodyguard

 _King._ Ho there! What dost thou? and with what intent
 Dost thou so outrage this Pelasgic land?
 Dost think thou comest to a town of women?                          890
 Too haughty thou, a stranger 'gainst Hellenes,
 And, sinning much, hast nothing done aright.

 _Her._ What sin against the right have I then done?

 _King._ First, thou know'st not how stranger-guest should act.

 _Her._ How so? When I, but finding what I lost....

 _King._ Whom among us dost thou then patrons call?

 _Her._ Hermes the Searcher, chiefest patron mine.[263]

 _King._ Thou, Gods invoking, honourest not the Gods.

 _Her._ The Gods of Neilos are the Gods I worship.

 _King._ Ours then are nought, if I thy meaning catch.        900

 _Her._ These girls I'll lead, if no one rescues them.

 _King._ Lay hand on them, and soon thou'lt pay the cost.

 _Her._ I hear a word in no wise hospitable.

 _King._ Who rob the Gods I welcome not as guests.

 _Her._ I then will tell Ægyptos' children this.

 _King._ This threat is all unheeded in my mind.

 _Her._ But that I, knowing all, may speak it plain,
 (For it is meet a herald should declare
 Each matter clearly,) what am I to say?
 By whom have I been robbed of that fair band
 Of women whom I claim as kindred? Nay,                              910
 But it is Ares that shall try this cause,
 And not with witnesses, nor money down,
 Settling the matter, but there first must fall
 Full many a soldier, and of many a life
 The rending in convulsive agony.

 _King._ Why should I tell my name? In time thou'lt know it,
 Thou and thy fellow-travellers. But these maidens,
 With their consent and free choice of their wills,
 Thou may'st lead off, if godly speech persuade them:
 But this decree our city's men have made
 With one consent, that we to force yield not
 This company of women. Here the nail                                920
 Is driven tight home to keep its place full firm;[264]
 These things are written not on tablets only,
 [Nor signed and sealed in folds of byblos-rolls;]
 Thou hear'st them clearly from a tongue that speaks
 With full, free speech. Away, away, I say:
 And with all speed from out my presence haste.

 _Her._ It is thy will then a rash war to wage:
 May strength and victory on our males attend!

                                                                 [_Exit_

 _King._ Nay, thou shall find the dwellers of this land
 Are also males, and drink not draughts of ale                       930
 From barley brewed.[265] [_To the Suppliants._] But ye, and your
    attendants,
 Take courage, go within the fencèd city,
 Shut in behind its bulwark deep of towers;
 Yea, many houses to the State belong,
 And I a palace own not meanly built,
 If ye prefer to live with many others
 In ease and plenty: or if that suits better,
 Ye may inhabit separate abodes.
 Of these two offers that which pleases best
 Choose for yourselves, and I as your protector,                     940
 And all our townsmen, will defend the pledge
 Which our decree has given you. Why wait'st thou
 For any better authorised than these?

 _Chor._ For these thy good deeds done may'st thou in good,
 All good, abound, great chief of the Pelasgi!
         But kindly send to us
 Our father Danaos, brave and true of heart,
         To counsel and direct.
 His must the first decision be where we
         Should dwell, and where to find
 A kindly home; for ready is each one
 To speak his word of blame 'gainst foreigners.                      950
         But may all good be ours!
 And so with fair repute and speech of men,
         Free from all taint of wrath,
 So place yourselves, dear handmaids, in the land,
 As Danaos hath for each of us assigned
         Dowry of handmaid slaves.

                 _Enter_ DANAOS _followed by_ Soldiers

 _Dan._ My children, to the Argives ye should pray,
 And sacrifice, and full libations pour,
 As to Olympian Gods, for they have proved,
 With one consent, deliverers: and they heard
 *All that I did towards those cousins there,             960
 *Those lovers hot and bitter. And they gave
 To me as followers these that bear the spear,
 That I might have my meed of honour due,
 And might not die by an assassin's hand
 A death unlooked-for, and thus leave the land
 A weight of guilt perpetual: and 'tis fit
 That one who meets such kindness should return,
 *From his heart's depths, a nobler gratitude;
 And add ye this to all already written,
 Your father's many maxims of true wisdom,
 That we, though strangers, may in time be known;                    970
 For as to aliens each man's tongue is apt
 For evil, and spreads slander thoughtlessly;
 But ye, I charge you, see ye shame me not,
 With this your life's bloom drawing all men's eyes.
 The goodly vintage is full hard to watch,
 All men and beasts make fearful havoc of it,
 Nay, birds that fly, and creeping things of earth;
 And Kypris offers fruitage, dropping ripe,
 *As prey to wandering lust, nor lets it stay;[266]
 And on the goodly comeliness of maidens                             980
 Each passer-by, o'ercome with hot desire,
 Darts forth the amorous arrows of the eye.
 And therefore let us suffer nought of this,
 Through which our ship has ploughed such width of sea,
 Such width of trouble; neither let us work
 Shame to ourselves, and pleasure to our foes.
 This twofold choice of home is open to you:
 [Pelasgos offers his, the city theirs,]
 To dwell rent-free. Full easy terms are these:
 Only, I charge you, keep your father's precepts,
 Prizing as more than life your chastity.                            990

 _Chor._ May the high Gods that on Olympos dwell
 Bless us in all things; but for this our vintage
 Be of good cheer, my father; for unless
 The counsels of the Gods work strange device,
 I will not leave my spirit's former path.


                               STROPHE I

 _Semi-Chor. A_. Go then and make ye glad the high Gods, blessed for
    ever,
 Those who rule our towns, and those who watch over our city,
 And they who dwell by the stream of Erasinos ancient.[267]

 _Semi-Chor. B_. And ye, companions true,
         Take up your strain of song.                               1000
 Let praise attend this city of Pelasgos;
 Let us no more, no more adore the mouths of Neilos
         With these our hymns of praise;


                             ANTISTROPHE I

 _Semi-Chor. A_. Nay, but the rivers here that pour calm streams through
    our country,[268]
 Parents of many a son, making glad the soil of our meadows,
 With wide flood rolling on, in full and abounding richness.

 _Semi-Chor. B_. And Artemis the chaste,
         May she behold our band                                    1010
 With pity; ne'er be marriage rites enforcèd
 On us by Kythereia: those who hate us,
         Let that ill prize be theirs.


                               STROPHE II

 _Semi-Chor. A_. Not that our kindly strain does slight to Kypris
    immortal;
 For she, together with Hera, as nearest to Zeus is mighty,
 A goddess of subtle thoughts, she is honoured in mysteries solemn.

 _Semi-Chor. B_. Yea, as associates too with that their mother
    belovèd,1020
 Are fair Desire and Suasion,[269] whose pleading no man can gainsay,
 Yea, to sweet Concord too Aphrodite's power is entrusted,
 *And the whispering paths of the Loves.


                             ANTISTROPHE II

 _Semi-Chor. A_. Yet am I sore afraid of the ship that chases us
    wanderers,
 Of terrible sorrows, and wars that are bloody and hateful;
 *Why else have they had fair gale for this their eager pursuing?1030

 _Semi-Chor. B_. Whate'er is decreed of us, I know that it needs must
    happen;
 The mighty purpose of Zeus, unfailing, admits no transgression:
 *May this fate come to us, as to many women before us,
         *Fate of marriage and spouse!


                              STROPHE III

 _Semi-Chor. A_. Ah, may great Zeus avert
 From me all marriage with Ægyptos' sons!

 _Semi-Chor. B_. Nay, all will work for good.

 _Semi-Chor. A_. Thou glozest that which will no glozing bear.1040

 _Semi-Chor. B_. And thou know'st not what future comes to us.


                            ANTISTROPHE III

 _Semi-Chor. A_. How can I read the mind
 Of mightiest Zeus, to sight all fathomless?

 _Semi-Chor. B_. Well-tempered be thy speech!

 _Semi-Chor. A_. What mood of calmnesss wilt thou school me in?

 _Semi-Chor. B_. Be not o'er-rash in what concerns the Gods.


                               STROPHE IV

 _Semi-Chor. A_. Nay, may our great king Zeus avert that marriage
         With husbands whom we hate,
 E'en He who, touching her with healing hand,
         Freed Io from her pain,
 Putting an end from all her wanderings,
         Working with kindly force!                                 1050


                             ANTISTROPHE IV

 _Semi-Chor. B_. And may He give the victory to women!
         I choose the better part,
 Though mixed with ill; and that the trial end
         Justly, as I have prayed,
 By means of subtle counsels which God gives
         To liberate from ills.[270]




                                ÆSCHYLOS


-----

Footnote 206:

  The daughters of Danaos are always represented as fifty in number. It
  seems probable, however, that the vocal chorus was limited to twelve,
  the others appearing as mutes.

Footnote 207:

  The alluvial deposit of the Delta.

Footnote 208:

  Syria is used obviously with a certain geographical vagueness, as
  including all that we know as Palestine, and the wilderness to the
  south of it, and so as conterminous with Egypt.

Footnote 209:

  Elsewhere in Æschylos (_Agam._ 33, _Fr._ 132) we trace allusion to
  games played with dice. Here we have a reference to one, the details
  of which are not accurately known to us, but which seems to have been
  analogous to draughts or chess.

Footnote 210:

  See the whole story, given as in prophecy, in the _Prometheus_, v.
  865-880.

Footnote 211:

  The invocation is addressed—(1) to the Olympian Gods in the brightness
  of heaven; (2) to the Chthonian deities in the darkness below the
  earth; (3) to Zeus, the preserver, as the supreme Lord of both.

Footnote 212:

  An Athenian audience would probably recognise in this a description of
  the swampy meadows near the coast of Lerna. The descendants of Io had
  come to the very spot where the tragic history of their ancestors had
  had its origin.

Footnote 213:

  The invocation passes on to Epaphos, as a guardian deity able and
  willing to succour his afflicted children.

Footnote 214:

  Philomela. See the tale as given in the notes to _Agam._ 1113.

Footnote 215:

  “Streams,” as flowing through the shady solitude of the groves which
  the nightingale frequented.

Footnote 216:

  “Ionian,” as soft and elegiac, in contrast with the more military
  character of Dorian music.

Footnote 217:

  In the Greek the _paronomasia_ turns upon the supposed etymological
  connection between θεὸς and τιθήμι. I have here, as elsewhere,
  attempted an analogous rather than identical _jeu de mot_.

Footnote 218:

  The Greek word which I have translated “bluff” was one not familiar to
  Attic ears, and was believed to be of Kyrenean origin. Æschylos
  accordingly puts it into the lips of the daughters of Danaos, as
  characteristic more or less of the “alien speech” of the land from
  which they came.

Footnote 219:

  So in v. 235 Danaos speaks of the “second Zeus” who sits as Judge in
  Hades. The feeling to which the Chorus gives utterance is that of—

              “Flectere si nequeo superos, Acheronta movebo.”

Footnote 220:

  Some mound dedicated to the Gods, with one or more altars and statues
  of the Gods on it, is on the stage, and the suppliants are told to
  take up their places there. The Gods of conflict who are named below,
  Zeus, Apollo, Poseidon, presided generally over the three great games
  of Greece. Hermes is added to the list.

Footnote 221:

  Comp. _Libation-Pourers_, 1024, _Eumen._ 44.

Footnote 222:

  The Argives are supposed to share the love of brevity which we
  commonly connect with their neighbours the Laconians.

Footnote 223:

  The “mighty bird of Zeus” seems here, from the answer of the Chorus,
  to mean not the “eagle” but the “sun,” which roused men from their
  sleep as the cock did, so that “cockcrow” and “sunrise” were
  synonymous. It is, in any case, striking that Zeus, rather than
  Apollo, appears as the Sun-God.

Footnote 224:

  The words refer to the myth of Apollo's banishment from heaven and
  servitude under Admetos.

Footnote 225:

  In the Acropolis at Athens the impress of a trident was seen on the
  rock, and was believed to commemorate the time when Poseidon had
  claimed it as his own by setting up his weapon there. Something of the
  same kind seems here to be supposed to exist at Argos, where a like
  legend prevailed.

Footnote 226:

  The Hellenic Hermes is distinguished from his Egyptian counterpart,
  Thoth, as being different in form and accessories.

Footnote 227:

  A possible reference to the Egyptian Osiris, as lord or judge of
  Hades. Comp. v. 145.

Footnote 228:

  “Shall I,” the Chorus asks, “speak to you as a private citizen, or as
  a herald, or as a king?”

Footnote 229:

  It would appear from this that the king himself bore the name
  Pelasgos. In some versions of the story he is so designated.

Footnote 230:

  The lines contain a tradition of the wide extent of the old Pelasgic
  rule, including Thessalia, or the Pelasgic Argos, between the mouths
  of Peneus and Pindos, Perrhæbia, Dodona, and finally the Apian land or
  Peloponnesos.

Footnote 231:

  The true meaning of the word “Apian,” as applied to the Peloponnesos,
  seems to have been “distant.” Here the myth is followed which
  represented it as connected with Apis the son of Telchin (son of
  Apollo, in the sense of being a physician-prophet), who had freed the
  land from monsters.

Footnote 232:

  The description would seem to indicate—(1) that the daughter of Danaos
  appeared on the stage as of swarthy complexion; and (2) that Indians,
  Æthiopians, Kyprians, and Amazons, were all thought of as in this
  respect alike.

Footnote 233:

  The line is conjectural, but some question of this kind is implied in
  the answer of the Chorus.

Footnote 234:

  By sacrificing personal likings to schemes of ambition, men and women
  contract marriages which increase their power.

Footnote 235:

  The Gods of conflict are the pilots of the ship of the State. The
  altar dedicated to them is as its stern: the garlands and wands of
  suppliants which adorn it are as the decorations of the vessels.

Footnote 236:

  Some editors have seen in this an attempt to enlist the constitutional
  sympathies of an Athenian audience in favour of the Argive king, who
  will not act without consulting his assembly. There seems more reason
  to think that the aim of the dramatist was in precisely the opposite
  direction, and that the words which follow set forth his admiration
  for the king who can act, as compared with one who is tied and
  hampered by restrictions.

Footnote 237:

  By an Attic law, analogous in principle to that of the Jews, (Num.
  xxxvi. 8; 1 Chron. xxiii. 22), heiresses were absolutely bound to
  marry their next of kin, if he claimed his right. The king at once
  asserts this as the law which was _primâ facie_ applicable to the
  case, and declares himself ready to surrender it if the petitioners
  can show that their own municipal law is on the other side. He will
  not thrust his country's customs upon foreigners, who can prove that
  they live under a different rule, but in the absence of evidence must
  act on the law which he is bound officially to recognise.

Footnote 238:

  _Sc._, the pollution which the statues of the Gods would contract if
  they carried into execution their threat of suicide.

Footnote 239:

  Inachos, the river-God of Argos, and as such contrasted with Neilos.

Footnote 240:

  _i.e._, “Unconsecrate,” marked out by no barriers, accessible to all,
  and therefore seeming to offer but little prospect of a safe asylum.
  The place described seems to have been an open piece of turf rather
  than a grove of trees.

Footnote 241:

  Comp. the narrative as given in _Prometheus Bound_, vv. 660, _et seq._

Footnote 242:

  Teuthras' fort, or Teuthrania, is described by Strabo (xii. p. 571) as
  lying between the Hellespont and Mount Sipylos, in Magnesia.

Footnote 243:

  Kypros, as dedicated to the worship of Aphrodite, and famous for its
  wine, and oil, and corn.

Footnote 244:

  The question, what caused the mysterious exceptional inundations of
  the Nile, occupied, as we see from Herodotos (ii. c. 19-27), the minds
  of the Greeks. Of the four theories which the historian discusses,
  Æschylos adopts that which referred it to the melting of the snows on
  the mountains of central Africa.

Footnote 245:

  Typhon, the mythical embodiment of the power of evil, was fabled to
  have wandered over Egypt, seeking the body of Osiris. Isis, to baffle
  him, placed coffins in all parts of Egypt, all empty but the one which
  contained the body.

Footnote 246:

  The fame of the Nile for the purity of its water, after the earthy
  matter held in solution had been deposited, seems to have been as
  great in the earliest periods of its history as it is now.

Footnote 247:

  Io was represented as a woman with a heifer's head, and was probably a
  symbolic representation of the moon, with her crescent horns.
  Sometimes the transformation is described (as in v. 294) in words
  which imply a more thorough change.

Footnote 248:

  Perhaps—

               “For not as subject sitting 'neath the sway
               Of strength above his own.”

Footnote 249:

  The passage takes its place among the noblest utterances of a faith
  passing above the popular polytheism to the thought of one sovereign
  Will ruling and guiding all things, as Will—without effort, in the
  calmness of a power irresistible.

Footnote 250:

  Double, as involving a sin against the laws of hospitality, so far as
  the suppliants were strangers—a sin against the laws of kindred, so
  far as they might claim by descent the rights of citizenship.

Footnote 251:

  If, as has been conjectured, the tragedy was written with a view to
  the alliance between Argos and Athens, made in B.C. 461, this choral
  ode must have been the centre, if not of the dramatic, at all events
  of the political interest of the play.

Footnote 252:

  The image is that of a bird of evil omen, perched upon the roof, and
  defiling the house, while it uttered its boding cries.

Footnote 253:

  The suppliants' boughs, so held as to shade the face from view.

Footnote 254:

  The name of Hecate connected Artemis as, on the one side, with the
  unseen world of Hades, so, on the other, with childbirth, and the
  purifications that followed on it.

Footnote 255:

  The name of Lykeian, originally, perhaps, simply representing Apollo
  as the God of Light, came afterwards to be associated with the might
  of destruction (the Wolf-destroyer) and the darts of pestilence and
  sudden death. The prayer is therefore that he, the Destroyer, may
  hearken to the suppliants, and spare the people for whom they pray.

Footnote 256:

  The “three great laws” were those ascribed to Triptolemos, “to honour
  parents, to worship the Gods with the fruits of the earth, to hurt
  neither man nor beast.”

Footnote 257:

  The Egyptian ships, like those of many other Eastern countries, had
  eyes (the eyes of Osiris, as they were called) painted on their bows.

Footnote 258:

  A side-thrust, directed by the poet, who had fought at Marathon,
  against the growing effeminacy of the Athenian youth, many of whom
  were learning to shrink from all activity and exposure that might
  spoil their complexions. Comp. Plato, _Phædros_, p. 239.

Footnote 259:

  The saying is somewhat dark, but the meaning seems to be that if the
  “dogs” of Egypt are strong, the “wolves” of Argos are stronger; that
  the wheat on which the Hellenes lived gave greater strength to limbs
  and sinew than the “byblos fruit” on which the Egyptian soldiers and
  sailors habitually lived. Some writers, however, have seen in the last
  line, rendered—

              “The byblos fruit not always bears full ear,”

  a proverb like the English,

                       “There's many a slip
                       'Twixt the cup and the lip.”

Footnote 260:

  The words recall the vision of the “seven well-favoured kine and
  fat-fleshed,” which “came out of the river,” as Pharaoh dreamed (Gen.
  xli. 1, 2), and which were associated so closely with the fertility
  which it ordinarily produced through the whole extent of the valley of
  the Nile.

Footnote 261:

  Two dangerous low headlands seem to have been known by this name, one
  on the coast of Kilikia, the other on that of the Thrakian Chersonese.

Footnote 262:

  No traces of ships of this structure are found in Egyptian art; but,
  if the reading be right, it implies the existence of boats of some
  kind, so built that they could be steered from either end.

Footnote 263:

  Hermes, the guardian deity of heralds, is here described by the
  epithet which marked him out as being also the patron of detectives.
  Every stranger arriving in a Greek port had to place himself under a
  _proxenos_ or patron of some kind. The herald, having no _proxenos_
  among the citizens, appeals to his patron deity.

Footnote 264:

  The words refer to the custom of nailing decrees, proclamations,
  treaties, and the like, engraved on metal or marble, upon the walls of
  temples or public buildings. Traces of the same idea may possibly be
  found in the promise to Eliakim that he shall be “as a nail in a sure
  place” (Isa. xxii. 23), in the thanksgiving of Ezra that God had given
  His people “a nail in his holy place” (Ezra ix. 8).

Footnote 265:

  As before, the bread of the Hellenes was praised to the disparagement
  of the “byblos fruit” of Egypt, so here their wine to that of the
  Egyptian beer, which was the ordinary drink of the lower classes.

Footnote 266:

  The words present a striking parallelism to the erotic imagery of the
  _Song of Solomon_: “Take us the foxes, the little foxes that spoil our
  vines, for our vines have tender grapes.” (ii. 15).

Footnote 267:

  The Erasinos was supposed to rise in Arcadia, in Mount Stymphalos, to
  disappear below the earth, and to come to sight again in Argolis.

Footnote 268:

  In this final choral ode of the _Suppliants_, as in that of the _Seven
  against Thebes_, we have the phenomenon of the division of the Chorus,
  hitherto united, into two sections of divergent thought and purpose.
  Semi-Chorus A. remains steadfast in its purpose of perpetual
  virginity; Semi-Chorus B. relents, and is ready to accept wedlock.

Footnote 269:

  The two names were closely connected in the local worship of Athens,
  the temples of Aphrodite and Peitho (Suasion) standing at the
  south-west angle of the Acropolis. If any special purpose is to be
  traced in the invocation, we may see it in the poet's desire to bring
  out the nobler, more ethical side of Aphrodite's attributes, in
  contrast with the growing tendency to look on her as simply the
  patroness of brutal lust.

Footnote 270:

  The play, as acted, formed part of a trilogy, and the next play, the
  _Danaids_, probably contained the sequel of the story, the acceptance
  by the Suppliants of the sons of Ægyptos in marriage, the plot of
  Danaos for the destruction of the bridegrooms on the wedding-night,
  and the execution of the deed of blood by all but Hypermnestra.
