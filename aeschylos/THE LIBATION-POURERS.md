_ARGUMENT.—It came to pass, after Agamemnon had been slain, that
Clytæmnestra and Ægisthos ruled in Argos, and all things seemed to go
well with them. Orestes, who was heir to Agamemnon, they had sent away
to the care of Strophios of Phokis, and there he abode. Electra, his
sister, mourned in secret over her father's death, and prayed for
vengeance, but no avenger came. And when Orestes grew up to man's
estate, he went to ask counsel of the God at Delphi, and the Gods
straitly charged him to take vengeance on his father's murderers; and so
he started on his journey with his trusty friend Pylades, and arrived at
Argos. And it chanced that a little while before he came, the Gods sent
Clytæmnestra a fearful dream, that troubled her soul greatly; and in her
terror she bade Electra go with her handmaids to pour libations on the
tomb of Agamemnon, that so she might appease his soul, and propitiate
the Powers that rule over the dark world of the dead._




                          THE LIBATION-POURERS


   SCENE.—Argos, _in front of the palace of the Atreidæ. The tomb of_
    AGAMEMNON _(a raised mound of earth) is seen in the background._

  _Enter_ ORESTES _and_ PYLADES _from the left;_ ORESTES _advances to
        the mound, and, as he speaks, lays on it a lock of his hair._

 _Orest._ O Hermes of the darkness 'neath the earth,
 Who hast the charge of all thy Father's[401] sway,
 To me who pray deliverer, helper be;
 For I to this land come, from exile come,
 And on the raised mound of this monument
 I bid my father hear and list. One tress,
 Thank-offering for the gifts that fed my youth,
 To Inachos I consecrate, and this
 The second as the token of my grief;[402]
 For mine it was not, father, being by,
 Over thy death to groan, nor yet to stretch
 My hand forth for the burial of thy corpse.

                 [_As he speaks_, ELECTRA, _followed by a train of
                     captive women in black garments, bearing libations,
                     wailing and tearing their clothes, comes
                     forth from the palace_

 What see I now? What company of women
 Is this that comes in mourning garb attired?
 What chance shall I conjecture as its cause?                         10
 Does a new sorrow fall upon this house?
 Or am I right in guessing that they bring
 Libations to my father, soothing gifts
 To those beneath? It cannot but be so.
 I think Electra, mine own sister, comes,
 By wailing grief conspicuous. Thou, O Zeus,
 Grant me full vengeance for my father's death,
 And of thine own good will my helper be!
 Come, Pylades, and let us stand aside,
 That I may clearly learn what means this train
 Of women offering prayers.                                           20


                               STROPHE I

 _Chor._ Sent from the house I come,
 With quick, sharp beatings of the hands in grief,
         To pour libations here;
 *And see, my cheeks with bloody marks are tracked,[403]
 The new-cut furrows which my nails have made,
 And evermore my heart is fed with groans;
         And folds of mantles tied
         Across the breast are rent
         To shreds and rags in grief,
 *Marring the grace of linen vestments fair,
 *Since we by woes that shut out smiles are smitten.       30


                             ANTISTROPHE I

         *Full clear a spectre came
 That made each single hair to stand on end,
         Dream-prophet of this house,
 That e'en in sleep breathes out avenging wrath;
 And from the secret chamber cried in fear
 A cry that broke the silence of the night,
         There, where the women dwell,
         Falling with heaviest weight;
         And those who judge such dreams
 Told, calling God to witness, that the souls
 Below were wroth and vexed with those that slew them.                40


                               STROPHE II

 On such a graceless deed of grace, as charm
 To ward off ill, (O Earth! O mother kind!)
         A godless woman now
         Sends me with eager heart;
 And yet I dread to utter that same prayer;
         What ransom has been found
         For blood on earth once poured?
         Oh! hearth all miserable!
 Oh! utter overthrow of house and home!
 Yea, mists of darkness, sunless, loathed of men,                     50
         Cover both home and house
         With its lords' bloody deaths.


                             ANTISTROPHE II

 Yea, all the majesty that awed of old,
 Unchecked, unconquered, irresistible,
         Thrilling the people's heart
         As well as ears, is gone;
 There are, may be, that fear;[404] but now Success
         Is man's sole God and more;
         Yet stroke of Vengeance swift
         Smites some in life's clear day,
 For some who tarry long their sorrows wait
 In twilight dim, on darkness' borderland,
         *And some an endless night
         Of nothingness holds fast.


                              STROPHE III

 Because of blood that mother earth has drunk,
 The guilt of slaughter that will vengeance work
         Is fixed indelibly;
         And Atè, working grief,                                      60
 Permits awhile the guilty one to wait,
 That so he may be full and overflow
         *With all-devouring ill.


                            ANTISTROPHE III

 For him whose foul touch stains the marriage bed[405]
 No remedy avails; and water-streams,
         Though all as from one source
         Should pour to cleanse the guilt
 *Of murder that the sin-stained hand defiles,
         *Would yet flow all in vain
         *That guilt to purify.


                                 EPODE

 But now to me, since the high Gods have sent
 A doom of bondage round my city's walls,
         (For from my father's home
 They have brought on me fate of slavery,)
         Deeds right and wrong alike
 Have been as things 'twas meet I should accept,                      70
         Since this slave-life began,
 Where deeds are done by violence and force,—
 And I must needs suppress
 *The bitter loathing of my inmost heart,
 *And now beneath my cloak I weep and wail
 *For all the frustrate fortunes of my lords,[406]
         Chilled through with secret grief.

 _Elect._ Ye handmaids, ye who deftly tend this house,
 Since ye are here companions in my task
 As suppliants, give me your advice in this,
 What shall I say as these funereal gifts
 I pour? How shall I speak acceptably?                                80
 How to my father pray? What? Shall I say
 “I bring from loving wife to husband loved
 Gifts”—from my mother? No, I am not bold
 Enough for that, nor know I what to speak,
 Pouring this chrism on my father's tomb,[407]
 Or shall I say this prayer, as men are wont,
 “Good recompense make thou to those who bring
 These garlands,” yea, a gift full well deserved
 By deeds of ill? Or dumb, with ignominy
 Like that with which he perished, shall I pour
 Libations on the earth, and like a man
 That flings away the lustral filth, shall I
 Throw down the urn and walk with eyes not turned?[408]               90
 Be sharers in my counsels, O my friends;
 A common hate we cherish in the house;
 Hide nothing in your heart through fear of man.
 Fate's doom firm-fixed awaits alike the free,
 And those in bondage to another's hand.
 Speak, if thou can'st a better counsel give.                        100

 _Chor._ [_laying their hands on Agamemnon's tomb._] Thy father's tomb
    as altar honouring,
 I, as thou bidd'st, will speak my heart-thoughts out!

 _Elect._ Speak, then, as thou my father's tomb dost honour,

 _Chor._ Say, as thou pour'st, good words for those that love,

 _Elect._ Which of my friends shall I address as such!

 _Chor._ First then thyself, and whoso hates Ægisthos.

 _Elect._ Shall I for thee, as for myself, pray thus?

 _Chor._ Now that thou'rt learning, judge of that thyself.

 _Elect._ Whom shall I add then to this company?

 _Chor._ Far though Orestes be, forget him not.

 _Elect._ Right well is this: thou teachest admirably.

 _Chor._ Then, for the blood-stained ones remembering say....

 _Elect._ What then? Explain, and teach my ignorance.[409]    110

 _Chor._ That there may come to them some God or man....

 _Elect._ Shall I “as judge” or as “avenger” say?

 _Chor._ Say it out plain! “to give them death for death.”...

 _Elect._ May prayers like these consist with piety?

 _Chor._ Why not,—a foe with evils to requite?

 _Elect._ [_moving to the tomb, and pouring libations as she speaks._]
    *O mightiest herald of the Gods on high
 And those below, O Hermes of the dark,
 Call thou the Powers beneath, and bid them hear
 The prayers that look towards my father's house;
 And Earth herself, who all things bringeth forth,                   120
 And rears them and again receives their fruit.
 And I to human souls libations pouring,
 Say, calling on my father, “Pity me;
 How shall we bring our dear Orestes home?”
 For now as sold to ill by her who bore us,
 We poor ones wander. She as husband gained
 Ægisthos, who was partner in thy death;
 And I am as a slave, and from his wealth
 Orestes now is banished, and they wax
 Full haughty in the wealth thy toil had gained.                     130
 And that Orestes hither with good luck
 May come, I pray. Hear thou that prayer, my father!
 And to myself grant thou that I may be
 Than that my mother wiser far of heart,
 Holier in act. For us this prayer I pour;
 And for our foes, my father, this I pray,
 That Justice may as thine avenger come,
 And that thy murderers perish. Thus I place
 Midway in prayer for good that now I speak,
 My prayer 'gainst them for evil. Be thou then
 The escort[410] of these good things that I ask,                    140
 With help of Gods, and Earth, and conquering Justice.
 With prayers like these my votive gifts I pour;
 And as for you [_turning to the Chorus_] 'tis meet with cries to crown
 The pæan ye utter, wailing for the dead.


                                STROPHE

 _Chor._ *Pour ye the pattering tear,
         *Falling for fallen lord,
 *Here by the tomb that shuts out good and ill,—
 Here, where the full libations have been poured
 That turn aside the curse men deprecate,
         Hear me, O Thou my Dread,                                   150
 Hear thou, O Sire, the words my dark mind speaks!


                              ANTISTROPHE

         Oh, woe is me, woe, woe!
         Woe, woe, and woe is me!
         *What warrior strong of spear
         Shall come the house to free,
 Or Ares with his Skythian bow[411] in hand,
 Shaking its pliant strength in deeds of war,
 *Or guiding in encounter closer yet
         The weapons made with hilts?

                   [_During the choral ode_ ELECTRA, _after going to the
                       mound, and pouring the libations on it, returns
                       holding in her hands the lock of hair which_
                       ORESTES _had left there_

 _Elect._ The gifts the earth hath drunk, my father hath them:
 Now this new wonder come and share with me.

 _Chor._ Speak on, my heart goes pit-a-pat with fear.

 _Elect._ There on the tomb I see this lock cut off.          160

 _Chor._ What man or maid low-girdled can it claim?

 _Elect._ Full easy this for any one to guess.

 _Chor._ Old as I am, may I from younger learn?

 _Elect._ None but myself could cut off lock like this.

 _Chor._ Yea, foes are they that should with grief-locks mourn.

 _Elect._ Yes, surely, 'tis indeed the self-same hair....

 _Chor._ But as what tresses? This I seek to know.

 _Elect._ And of a truth 'tis very like to ours....

 _Chor._ Did then Orestes send this secret gift?[412]

 _Elect._ It is most like those flowing locks of his.         170

 _Chor._ Yet how had he adventured to come hither?

 _Elect._ He to his father sent the lock as gift.

 _Chor._ Not less regretful than before, thy words,
 If on this soil his foot shall never tread.

 _Elect._ Yea, on me too there rushed heart-surge of gall
 And I was smitten as with dart that pierced;
 And from mine eyes there fell the thirsty drops
 That pour unchecked, of this full bitter flood,
 As I this lock beheld. How can I think
 That any other townsman owns this hair?                             180
 Nay, she who slew ... she did not cut it off,
 My mother ... who towards her children shows
 A godless mood that little suits the name;
 And yet that I should this assert outright,
 The precious gift is his whom most of men
 I love, Orestes.... Nay, hope flatters me.
 Alas! alas!
 Would, herald-like, it had a kindly voice!
 So should I not turn to and fro in doubt;
 But either it had told me with all clearness
 To loathe this tress, if cut from hated head;                       190
 Or, being of kin, had sought to share my grief,
 To deck the tomb and do my father honour.

 _Chor._ Well, on the Gods we call, on those who know
 In what storms we, like sailors, now are tossed:
 But if deliverance may indeed be ours,
 From a small seed a mighty trunk may grow.[413]

 _Elect._ Here too are foot-prints as a second proof,
 Just like ... yea, close resembling those of mine.
 For here are outlines of two separate feet,
 His own and those of fellow-traveller,                              200
 And all the heels and impress of the feet,
 When measured, fit well with my footsteps here....
 Pangs come on me, and sore bewilderment.

                        [_As she ceases speaking_ ORESTES _comes forward
                            from his concealment_

 _Orest._ Pray, uttering to the Gods no fruitless prayer,
 For good success in what is yet to come.

 _Elect._ What profits now to me the Gods' good will?

 _Orest._ Thou see'st those here whom most thou did'st desire.

 _Elect._ Whom called I on, that thou hast knowledge of?

 _Orest._ Right well I know how thou dost prize Orestes.

 _Elect._ In what then find I now my prayers fulfilled?       210

 _Orest._ Behold me! Seek no dearer friend than I!

 _Elect._ Nay, stranger, dost thou weave a snare for me?

 _Orest._ Then do I plot my schemes against myself.

 _Elect._ Thou seekest to make merry with my grief.

 _Orest._ With mine then also, if at all with thine.

 _Elect._ Art thou indeed Orestes that I speak to?

 _Orest._ Though thou see'st him, thou'rt slow to learn 'tis I;
 Yet when thou saw'st this lock of mourner's hair,
 And did'st the foot-prints track my feet had made,
 Agreeing with thine own, as brother's true,
 Then did'st thou deem in hope thou looked'st on me.                 220
 Fit then this lock where it was cut, and see;
 See too this woven robe, thine own hands' work,
 The shuttle's stroke, and forms of beasts[414] of chase.

                     [ELECTRA _starts, as if about to cry aloud for joy_

 Restrain thyself, nor lose thy head for joy:
 Our nearest kin, I know, are foes to us.

 _Elect._ [_embracing_ ORESTES] Thou whom thy father's house most loves,
    most prays for,
 Our one sole hope, bewept with many a tear,
 Of issue that shall work deliverance!
 Thine own might trusting, thou thy father's house
 Shall soon win back. O pleasant fourfold name!                      230
 I needs must speak to thee as father dear;[415]
 The love I owe my mother turns to thee,
 (She with full right to me is hateful now,)
 My sister's too, who ruthlessly was slain;
 And thou wast ever faithful brother found,
 And one whom I revered. May Might and Right,
 And sovran Zeus as third, my helpers be!

 _Orest._ Zeus! Zeus! be Thou a witness of our troubles,
 See the lorn brood that calls an eagle sire,
 Eagle that perished in the coils and folds                          240
 Of a fell viper. Now on them bereaved
 Presses gaunt famine. Not as yet full-grown
 Are they to bring their father's booty home.
 Thus it is thine to see in me and her,
 (I mean Electra) children fatherless,
 Both suffering the same exile from our home.

 _Elect._ And should'st Thou havoc make of brood of sire
 Who at thine altar greatly honoured Thee,
 Whence wilt Thou get a festive offering
 From hand as free? Nor, should'st Thou bring to nought
 The eagle's nestlings, would'st thou have at hand                   250
 A messenger to bear thy will to man
 In signs persuasive; nor when withered up
 This royal stock shall be, will it again
 Wait on thine altars at high festivals:
 Oh, bring it back, and then Thou too wilt raise
 From low estate a lofty house, which now
 Seems to have fallen, fallen utterly.

 _Chor._ Ah, children! saviours of your father's house,
 Hush, hush, lest some one hear you, children dear,
 And for mere talking's sake report all this
 To those that rule. Ah, would I might behold them
 Lie dead 'midst oozing fir-pyre blazing high![416]                  260

 _Orest._ Nay, nay, I tell you, Loxias' oracle,
 In strength excelling, will not fail us now,
 That bade me on this enterprise to start,
 And with clear voice spake often, warning me
 Of chilling pain-throes at the fevered heart,
 Unless my father's murderers I should chase,
 Bidding me kill them in the self-same fashion,
 Stirred by the wrongs that pauperise my life,
 And said that I with many a mischief ill
 Should pay for that fault with mine own dear life.
 For making known to men the charms earth-born                       270
 *That soothe the wrathful powers,[417] he spake for us
 Of ills as follows, leprous sores that creep
 All o'er the flesh, and as with cruel jaws
 Eat out its ancient nature, and white hairs[418]
 On that foul ill to supervene: and still
 He spake of other onsets of the Erinnyes,
 As brought to issue from a father's blood;
 For the dark weapon of the Gods below
 Winged by our kindred that lie low in death,
 And beg for vengeance, yea, and madness too,
 And vague, dim fears at night disturb and haunt me,
 *Seeing full clearly, though I move my brow[419]         280
 In the thick darkness ... and that then my frame,
 Thus tortured, should be driven from the city
 With brass-knobbed scourge: and that for such as I
 It was not given to share the wine-cup's taste,
 Nor votive stream in pure libation poured;
 And that my father's wrath invisible
 Would drive me from all altars, and that none
 Should take me in, or lodge with me; at last,
 That, loathed of all and friendless, I should die,
 A wretched mummy, all my strength consumed.
 Must I not trust such oracles as these?
 Yea, though I trust not, must the deed be done;                     290
 For many motives now in one converge,—
 The God's command, great sorrow for my father;
 My lack of fortune, this, too, urges me
 Never to leave our noble citizens,
 With noblest courage Troïa's conquerors,
 To be the subjects to two women thus;
 Yea, his soul is as woman's:[420] an' it be not,
 He soon shall know the issue.

 _Chor._ Grant ye from Zeus, O mighty Destinies!
         That so our work may end
 As Justice wills, who takes our side at last;                       300
 Now for the tongue of bitter hate let tongue
 Of bitter hate be given. Loud and long
 The voice of Vengeance claiming now her debt;
         And for the murderous blow
 Let him who slew with murderous blow repay.
 “That the wrong-doer bear the wrong he did,”
 Thrice-ancient saying of a far-off time,[421]
         This speaketh as we speak.


                               STROPHE I

 _Orest._ O father, sire ill-starred,
         What deed or word could I
         Waft from afar to thee,
         Where thy couch holds thee now,                             310
 *To be a light with dark commensurate?
         Alike, in either case,
 The wail that tells their praise is welcome gift
 To those Atreidæ, guardians of our house.


                               STROPHE II

 _Chor._ My child, my child, the mighty jaws of fire[422]
 Bind not the mood and spirit of the dead!
 But e'en when that is past he shows his wrath.
         When he that dies is wailed,
         The murderer stands revealed:                               320
 The righteous cry for parents that begat,
         To fullest utterance roused,
         Searches the whole truth out.


                             ANTISTROPHE I

 _Elect._ Hear then, O father, now
         Our tearful griefs in turn;
         From us thy children twain
         The funeral wail ascends;
 And we, as suppliants and as exiles too,
         Find shelter at thy tomb.
 What of all this is good, what void of ills?                        330
 Is not this now a woe invincible?

 _Chor._ Yet, even yet, from evils such as these,
 God, if He will, may bring more pleasant strains:
 And for the dirge we utter by the tomb,
 A pæan in the royal house may raise
         Welcome to new-found friend.


                              STROPHE III

 _Orest._ Had'st thou beneath the walls
         Of Ilion, O my sire,
         Been slain by Lykian foe,[423]
         Pierced through and through with spear,
         Leaving high fame at home,                                  340
         And laying strong and sure
         *Thy children's paths in life,
         Then had'st thou had as thine
         Far off across the sea
         A mound of earth heaped high,
 To all thy kith and kin endurable.


                             ANTISTROPHE II

 _Chor._ Yea, and as friend with friends
         That nobly died, he then
         Had dwelt in high estate
         A sovereign ruler, held
         Of all in reverence,
         High in their train who rule
         Supreme in that dark world;                                 350
         For he, too, while he lived,
         As monarch ruled o'er those
         Whose hands the sceptre held
         That mortal men obey.[424]


                            ANTISTROPHE III

 _Elect._ Not even 'neath the walls
         Of Troïa, O my sire,
         With those the spear hath slain,
         Would I have had thee lie
         By fair Scamandros' stream:
         No, this my prayer shall be
         That those who slew thee fall,
         *By their own kin struck down,                   360
         That one might hear far off,
         Untried by woes like this,
 The fate that brings inevitable death.

 _Chor._ Of blessings more than golden, O my child,
 Greater than greatest fortune, or the bliss
 Of those beyond the North[425] thou speakest now;
         For this is in thy grasp;
 But hold; e'en now this thud of double scourge[426]
         Finds its way on to him;
 Already these find helpers 'neath the earth,
 But of those rulers whom we loathe and hate
         Unholy are the hands:                                       370
         And children gain the day.


                               STROPHE IV

 _Elect._ Ah! this, like arrow, pierces through the ear!
 O Zeus! O Zeus! who sendest from below
         A woe of tardy doom
 Upon the bold and subtle hands of men....
         Nay, though they parents be,
         Yet all shall be fulfilled.


                               STROPHE V

 _Chor._ May it be mine to chant o'er funeral pyre
 *Cry well accordant with the pine-fed blaze,[427]
         When first the man is slain,
         And his wife perisheth!                                     380
 Why should I hide what flutters round my heart?
 On my heart's prow a blast blows mightily,
         Keen wrath and loathing fierce.


                             ANTISTROPHE IV

 _Orest._ And when shall Zeus, the orphan's guardian true,
 Lay to his hand and smite the guilty heads?
         So may our land learn faith!
 Vengeance I claim from those who did the wrong.                     390
         Hear me, O Earth, and ye,
         *Powers held in awe below!

 _Chor._ Yea, the law saith that gory drops once shed
 Upon the ground for yet more blood should crave;
 *For lo! fell slaughter on Erinnys calls,
 To come from those that perished long ago,
 And on one sorrow other sorrow bring.


                               STROPHE VI

 _Elect._ *Ah, ah, O Earth, and Lords of those below!
 Behold, ye mighty Curses of the slain,
 Behold the remnant of the Atreidæ's house
         Brought to extremest strait,                                400
         Bereaved of house and home!
 Whither, O Zeus, can any turn for help?


                             ANTISTROPHE V

 _Chor._ Ah, my fond heart is quivering in dismay,
 *Hearing this loud lament most lamentable:
         Now have I little cheer,
         And blackened is my heart,
 *Hearing that speech; but then again when hope
 *On strength uplifts me, far it drives my grief,
         *Propitious seen at last.


                             ANTISTROPHE VI

 _Orest._ What could we speak more fitly than the woes        410
 We suffer, yea, and from a parent's hands?
 Well, she may fawn; our mood remains unsoothed;
         For like a wolf untamed,
         We from our mother take
 A wrathful soul that to no fawning yields.


                              STROPHE VII

 _Chor._ *I strike an Arian stroke, and in the strain
         Of Kissian mourner skilled,[428]
 Ye might have seen the stretching forth of hands,
 With rendings of the hair, and random blows,
         In quick succession given,
 Dealt from above with arm at fullest length,
 And with the beating still my head is stunned,                      420
         Battered and full of woe.

 _Elect._ O mother, hostile found, and daring all!
         With burial as of foe
 Thou had'st the heart a ruler to inter,
         His citizens not there,
 A spouse unwept, with no lamentings loud.


                              STROPHE VIII

 _Orest._ Ah! thou hast told the whole full tale of shame;
 Shall she not pay then for that outrage dire
         Unto my father done,
         So far as Gods prevail,
         So far as my hands work?
 May it be mine to smite her and then die!                           430


                            ANTISTROPHE VII

 _Chor._ Yea, he was maimed![429] (that thou the tale may'st know)
 And as she slaughtered, so she buried him,
         Seeking to work a doom
 For thy young life all unendurable.
         Now thou dost hear the woes
 Thy father suffered, stained with foulest shame.


                            ANTISTROPHE VIII

 _Elect._ Thou tellest of my father's death, but I
         Stood afar off, contemned,
 Counted as nought, and like a cursèd hound
 Shut up within, I poured the tide of tears
         (More ready they than smiles)
 Uttering in secret wail of weeping full.                            440
 Hear thou these things, and write them in my mind.

 _Chor._ Let the tale pierce thine ears,
 While thy soul onward moves with tranquil step:
         So much, thou know'st, stands thus;
 Seek thou with all desire to know the rest;
         'Tis meet to enter now
 Within the lists with mind inflexible.


                               STROPHE IX

 _Orest._ I bid thee, O my father, help thy friends.

 _Elect._ Bitterly weeping, these my tears I add.

 _Chor._ With full accord so cries our company.
           Come then to light, and hear;                             450
           Be with us 'gainst our foes.


                             ANTISTROPHE IX

 _Orest._ My Might their Might, my Right their
           Right must meet.

 _Elect._ *Ye Gods, give righteous issue in our cause.

 _Chor._ Fear creeps upon me as I hear your prayers.
           Long tarries destiny,
           But comes to those who pray.


                               STROPHE X

 _Semi-Chor. A._ Oh, woe that haunts the race,
 And harsh, shrill stroke of Atè's bloody scourge!
         Woes sad and hard to bear,                                  460
         Calling for wailing loud,
 Ah, woe is me, a grief immedicable.


                             ANTISTROPHE X

 _Semi-Chor. B._ Yea, but as cure for this,
 And healing salve,'tis yours with your own hands,
         With no help from without,
         *To press your suit of blood;
 So runs our hymn to those great Gods below.

 _Chor._ Yea, hearing now, ye blest Ones 'neath the earth,
 This prayer, send ye your children timely help
         That worketh victory.

 _Orest._ O sire, who in no kingly fashion died'st,           470
 Hear thou my prayer; grant victory o'er this house.

 _Elect._ I, father, ask this prayer, that I may work
 *Ægisthos' death, and then acquittal gain.

 _Orest._ Yea, thus the banquets that men give the dead
 Would for thee too be held, but otherwise
 *Dishonoured wilt thou lie 'mid those that feast,[430]
 Robbed of thy country's rich burnt-offerings.

 _Elect._ I too from out my father's house will bring
 Libations from mine own inheritance,
 As marriage offerings. Chief and first of all,
 Will I do honour to this sepulchre.

 _Orest._ Set free my sire, O Earth, to watch the battle.     480

 _Elect._ O Persephassa, goodly victory grant!

 _Orest._ Remember, sire, the bath in which they slew thee!

 _Elect._ *Remember thou the net they handselled so!

 _Orest._ In fetters not of brass wast thou snared, father.

 _Elect._ Yea, basely with that mantle they devised.

 _Orest._ Art thou not roused by these reproaches, father?

 _Elect._ Dost thou not lift thine head for those thou lov'st?

 _Orest._ Or send thou Vengeance to assist thy friends;
 Or let them get like grasp of those thy foes,
 If thou, o'ercome, dost wish to conquer them.                       490

 _Elect._ And hear thou this last prayer of mine, my father,
 Seeing us thy nestlings sitting at thy tomb,
 Have mercy on thy boy and on thy girl;
 Nor blot thou out the seed of Pelopids:
 So thou, though thou hast died, art yet not dead;
 For children are the voices that preserve
 Man's memory when he dies: so bear the net
 The corks that float the flax-mesh from the deep.
 Hear thou: This is our wailing cry for thee,
 And thou, our prayer regarding, sav'st thyself.                     500

 _Chor._ Unblamed have ye your utterance lengthened out,
 Amends for that his tomb's unwept-for lot.
 But as to what remains, since thou'rt resolved
 To act, act now; make trial of thy Fate.

 _Orest._ So shall it be. Yet 'tis not out of course
 To ask why she libations sent, why thus
 Too late she cares for ill she cannot cure?
 Yea, to a dead man heeding not 'twas sent,
 A sorry offering. Why, I fail to guess:
 The gifts are far too little for the fault;                         510
 For should a man pour all he has to pay
 For one small drop of blood, the toil were vain:
 So runs the saying. But if thou dost know,
 Tell this to me as wishing much to learn.

 _Chor._ I know, my child, for I was by. Stirred on
 By dreams and wandering terrors of the night,
 That godless woman these libations sent.

 _Orest._ And have ye learnt the dream, to tell it right?

 _Chor._ As she doth say, she thought she bare a snake.

 _Orest._ How ends the tale, and what its outcome then?

 _Chor._ She nursed it, like a child, in swaddling clothes.   520

 _Orest._ What food did that young monster crave for then?

 _Chor._ She in her dream her bosom gave to it.

 _Orest._ How 'scaped her breast by that dread beast unhurt?

 _Chor._ Nay, with the milk it sucked out clots of blood.

 _Orest._ Ah, not in vain comes this dream from her lord.

 _Chor._ She, roused from sleep, cries out all terrified,
 And many torches that were quenched in gloom
 Blazed for our mistress' sake within the house.
 Then these libations for the dead she sends,
 Hoping they'll prove good medicine of ills.                         530

 _Orest._ Now to Earth here and my sire's tomb I pray
 They leave not this strange vision unfulfilled.
 So I expound it that it all coheres;
 For if, the self-same spot that I left leaving,
 *The snake was then wrapt in my swaddling clothes,
 And sucked the very breast that nourished me,
 And mixed the sweet milk with a clot of blood,
 And she in terror wailed the strange event,
 So must she, as that monster dread she nourished,
 Die cruel death: and I, thus serpentised,                           540
 Am here to slay her, as this dream portends;
 I take thee as my dream-interpreter.

 _Chor._ So be it; but in all else guide thy friends;
 *Bid some do this, some that, some nought at all.

 _Orest._ Simple my orders, that she [_pointing to_ ELECTRA] go within;
 And you, I charge you, hide these plans of mine,
 That they who slew a noble soul by guile,
 By guile may die and in the self-same snare
 Be caught, as Loxias gave his oracle,
 The king Apollo, seer that never lied: 550
 For like a stranger in full harness clad
 Will I draw near with this man, Pylades,
 To the great gates, a stranger I, and he,
 Ally in arms. And then we both will speak
 Parnassian speech, and imitate the tone
 Of Phokian tongue. And should no porter there
 Give us good welcome, on the ground that now
 The house with ills is haunted, there we'll stay,
 So that a man who passeth by the house
 Will guess, and thus will speak, “Why drives Ægisthos
 The suppliant from his gate, if he's at home
 And knows it?” But if I should pass the threshold 560
 Of the great gate, and find him seated there
 Upon my father's throne, or if he comes
 And meets me, face to face, and lifts his eyes,
 And drops them, then be sure, before he says,
 “Whence is this stranger?”—I will lay him dead,
 With my swift-footed brazen weapon pierced;
 And then Erinnys, stinted not in slaughter,
 Shall drink her third draught of unmingled blood.[431]
 Thou, then, [_to_ ELECTRA] watch well what passes in the house, 570
 So that these things may dovetail close and well:
 And you [_to the Chorus_] I bid to keep a tongue discreet,
 Silent, if need be, or the right word speaking,
 And Him[432] [_pointing to the statue of Apollo_] I call to look upon
    me here,
 Since he has set me on this strife of swords.

                               [_Exeunt_ ORESTES, PYLADES, _and_ ELECTRA


                               STROPHE I

 _Chor._ Many dread forms of evils terrible
         Earth bears, and Ocean's bays
         With monsters wild and fierce
 *O'erflow, and through mid-air the meteor lights         580
         Sweep by; and wingèd birds
 And creeping things can tell the vehement rage
         Of whirling storms of winds.


                             ANTISTROPHE I

 But who man's temper overbold may tell,
         Or daring passionate loves
         Of women bold in heart,
 Passions close bound with men's calamities?
         Love that true love disowns,
 That sways the weaker sex in brutes and men,                        590
         Usurps o'er wedlock's ties.


                               STROPHE II

 Whoso is not bird-witted, let him think
         What scheme she learnt to plan,
 Of subtle craft that wrought its will by fire,
 That wretched child of Thestios, who to slay
         Her son did set a-blaze
         The brand that glowed blood-red,
 Which had its birth when first from out the womb
         He came with infant's wail,
 And spanned the measure of its life with his,                       600
         On to the destined day.[433]


                             ANTISTROPHE II

 Another, too, must we with loathing name,
         Skylla, with blood defiled.[434]
 Who for the sake of foes a dear one slew,
 Won by the gold-chased bracelets brought from Crete,
         The gifts that Minos gave,
         And knowing not the end,
 Robbed Nisos of his lock of deathless life,
         She with her dog-like heart                                 610
 Surprising him deep-breathing in his sleep;
         But Hermes comes on her.[435]


                              STROPHE III

 And since I tell the tale of ruthless woes....[436]
         Yet now 'tis not the time
 *To tell of evil marriage which this house
         Doth loathe and execrate,
 And of a woman's schemes and stratagems
         Against a warrior chief,
 *Chief whom his people honoured as was meet,
 I give my praise to hearth from hot broils free,
         And praise that woman's mood
         That dares no deed of ill.


                            ANTISTROPHE III

 But of all crimes the Lemnian foremost stands[437]                  620
         *And the Earth mourns that woe
 As worthy of all loathing. Yes, this guilt
         One might have well compared
 With Lemnian ills; and now that race is gone,
         To lowest shame brought down
 By the foul guilt the Gods abominate:
 For no man honours what the Gods condemn,
         Which instance of all these
         Do I not rightly urge?[438]


                               STROPHE IV

 And now the sword already at the heart,
 Sharp-pointed, strikes a blow that pierces through,
     While Vengeance guides the hand;                                630
     For lo! the lawlessness
 Of one who doth transgress all lawlessly
 The might and majesty of Zeus, lies not
     As trampled under foot.[439]


                             ANTISTROPHE IV

 The anvil-block of Vengeance firm is set,
 And Fate, the swordsmith, hammers on the bronze
     Beforehand; and the child
     Is brought unto his home,
 And in due time the debt of guilt is paid
 By the dark-souled Erinnys, famed of old,
 For blood of former days.


     ORESTES _and_ PYLADES _enter, disguised as Phokian travellers,
            go to the door of the palace, and knock loudly_

 _Orest._ What ho, boy! hear us knocking at the gate.         640
 Who is within, boy? who, boy?—hear, again;
 A third time now I give my summons here,
 If good Ægisthos' house be hospitable.

                                             [_A_ SLAVE _opens the door_

 _Slave._ Hold, hold; I hear. What stranger comes, and whence?

 _Orest._ Tell thou thy lords who over this house rule,
 To whom I come and tidings new report;
 And make good speed, for now the dusky car
 Of night comes on apace, and it is time
 For travellers in hospitable homes
 To cast their anchor; and let some one come
 From out the house who hath authority;                              650
 The lady, if so be one ruleth here,
 But, seemlier far, her lord; for then no shame
 In converse makes our words obscure and dim;
 But man with man gains courage to speak out,
 And makes his mission manifest as day.

                          _Enter_ CLYTÆMNESTRA

 _Clytæm._ If ye need aught, O strangers, speak; for here
 Is all that's fitting for a house like ours;
 Warm baths,[440] and bed that giveth rest from toil,
 And presence of right honest faces too;
 If there be aught that needeth counsel more,
 That is men's business, and to them we'll tell it.                  660

 _Orest._ A Daulian traveller, from Phokis come,
 Am I, and as I went on business bound,
 My baggage with me, unto Argos, I
 (Just as I set forth,) met a man I knew not,
 Who knew not me, and he then, having asked
 My way and told me his, the Phokian Strophios
 (For so I learnt in talking) said to me,
 “Since thou dost go, my friend, for Argos bound,
 In any case, tell those who gave him birth,
 Remembering it right well, Orestes' death;
 See thou forget it not, and whether plans                           670
 Prevail to fetch him home, or bury him
 There where he is, a stranger evermore,
 Bear back the message as thy freight for us;
 For now the ribbed sides of an urn of bronze
 The ashes hide of one whom men have wept.”
 So much I heard and now have told; and if
 I speak to kin that have a right in him
 I know not, but his father sure should know it.

 _Clytæm._ Ah, thou hast told how utterly our ruin
 Is now complete! O Curse of this our house,
 Full hard to wrestle with! How many things,                         680
 Though lying out of reach, thou aimest at,
 And with well-darted arrows from afar
 Dost bring them low! And now thou strippest me,
 Most wretched one, of all that most I loved.
 A lucky throw Orestes now was making,
 Getting his feet from out destruction's slough;
 But now the hope of high, exulting joy,
 *Which this house had as healer, he scores down
 As present in this fashion that we see.

 _Orest._ I could have wished to come to prosperous hosts,
 As known and welcomed for my tidings good;
 For who to hosts is friendlier than a guest?                        690
 But 'twould have been as impious in my thoughts
 Not to complete this matter for my friends,
 By promise bound and pledged as guest to host.

 _Clytæm._ Thou shalt not meet with less than thou deserv'st;
 Nor wilt thou be to this house less a friend;
 Another would have brought news all the same:
 But since 'tis time that strangers who have made
 A long day's journey find the things they need,
 Lead him [_to her Slave, pointing to_ ORESTES] to these our hospitable
    halls,
 And these his fellow-travellers and servants:                       700
 There let them meet with what befits our house.
 I bid thee act as one who gives account;
 And we unto the masters of our house
 Will tell this news, and with no lack of friends
 Deliberate of this calamity.[441]

                               [_Exeunt_ CLYTÆMNESTRA, ORESTES, PYLADES,
                                   _and Attendants_

 _Chor._ Come then, handmaids of the palace,
         When shall we with full-pitched voices
         Show our feeling for Orestes?
     O earth revered! thou height revered, too,
     Of the mound piled o'er the body
     Of our navy's kingly captain,                                   710
     Oh, hear us now; oh, come and help us;
     For 'tis time for subtle Suasion[442]
     To go with them to the conflict,
     And that Hermes act as escort,
     He who dwells in earth's deep darkness,
     In the strife where swords work mischief.

                            _Enter_ KILISSA

 _Chor._ The stranger seems about to work some ill;
 And here I see Orestes' nurse in tears.
 Where then, Kilissa, art thou bound, that thus
 Thou tread'st the palace-gates, and with thee comes
 Grief as a fellow-traveller unbidden?                               720

 _Kilis._ Our mistress bids me with all speed to call
 Ægisthos to the strangers, that he come
 And hear more clearly, as a man from man,
 This newly-brought report. Before her slaves,
 Under set eyes of melancholy cast,
 She hid her inner chuckle at the events
 That have been brought to pass—too well for her,
 But for this house and hearth most miserably,—
 As in the tale the strangers clearly told.
 He, when he hears and learns the story's gist,
 Will joy, I trow, in heart. Ah, wretched me!                        730
 How those old troubles, of all sorts made up,
 Most hard to bear, in Atreus' palace-halls
 Have made my heart full heavy in my breast!
 But never have I known a woe like this.
 For other ills I bore full patiently,
 But as for dear Orestes, my sweet charge,
 Whom from his mother I received and nursed....
 And then the shrill cries rousing me o' nights.
 And many and unprofitable toils
 For me who bore them. For one needs must rear
 The heedless infant like an animal,                                 740
 (How can it else be?) as his humour serves.
 For while a child is yet in swaddling clothes,
 *It speaketh not, if either hunger comes,
 Or passing thirst, or lower calls of need;
 And children's stomach works its own content.
 And I, though I foresaw this, call to mind
 How I was cheated, washing swaddling clothes,
 And nurse and laundress did the self-same work.
 I then with these my double handicrafts,
 Brought up Orestes for his father dear;
 And now, woe's me! I learn that he is dead,                         750
 And go to fetch the man that mars this house:
 And gladly will he hear these words of mine.

 _Chor._ And how equipped then doth she bid him come?

 _Nurse._ 'How?' Speak again that I may better learn.

 _Chor._ By spearmen followed, or himself alone?

 _Nurse._ She bids him bring his guards with lances armed.

 _Chor._ Nay, say not that to him thy lord doth hate.[443]
 But bid him 'come alone,' (that so he hear
 Without alarm,) 'full speed, with joyous mind,'
 Since 'secret speech with messengers goes best.'                    760

 _Nurse._ And art thou of good cheer at this my tale?

 _Chor._ But what if Zeus will turn the tide of ill?

 _Nurse._ How so? Orestes, our one hope is gone.

 _Chor._ Not yet; a sorry seer might know thus much.

 _Nurse._ What say'st thou? Know'st thou aught besides my tale?

 _Chor._ Go tell thy message; do thine errand well:
 The Gods for what they care for, care enough.

 _Nurse._ I then will go, complying with thy words:
 May all, by God's gift, end most happily!


                               STROPHE I

 _Chor._ Now to my prayer, O Father of the Gods               770
         Of high Olympos, Zeus,
 Grant that their fortune may be blest indeed
 *Who long to look on goodness prospering well,
         Yea, with full right and truth
 I speak the word—O Zeus, preserve thou him!


                               STROPHE II

 Yea, Zeus, set him whom now the palace holds,
         Set him above his foes;
         For if thou raise him high,
 Then shall thou have, to thy heart's full content,
 Payment of twofold, threefold recompense.


                             ANTISTROPHE I

 Know that the son of one who loved thee well                        780
         *Like colt of sire bereaved,
 *Is to the chariot of great evils yoked,
 *And set thy limit to his weary path.
         *Ah, would that one might see
 *His panting footsteps, as he treads his course,
 *Keeping due measure through this plain of ours!


                              STROPHE III

         And ye within the gate,
         Ye Gods, in purpose one,
         Who dwell in shrines enriched
         With all good things, come ye,
         And now with vengeance fresh
         Atone for murder foul
         Of those that fell long since:                              790
         *And let that blood of old,
         *When these are justly slain,
         Breed no more in our house.


                                 MESODE

 O Thou[444] that dwellest in the cavern vast,
         Adorned with goodly gifts,
 Grant our lord's house to look up yet once more,
         And that it now may glance,
         In free and glorious guise
         With loving kindly eyes,
         From out its veil of gloom.
         Let Maia's son[445] too give
         His righteous help, and waft
         Good end with prosperous gale.


                            ANTISTROPHE III

         *And things that now are hid,                    800
         He, if he will, will bring
         As to the daylight clear;
         But when it pleases him
         Dark, hidden words to speak,
         As in thick night he bears
         Black gloom before his face;[446]
         Nor is he in the day
         One whit more manifest.


                               STROPHE IV

         *And then our treasured store,[447]
         *The price as ransom paid
         To free the house from ill,
         A woman's gift on breath
         Of favouring breeze onborne,
         We then with clamorous cry,
         To sound of cithern sweet,
         Will in the city pour;
         And if this prospers well,
 *My gains, yea mine, 'twill swell, and Atè then
         From those I love stands far.                               810


                             ANTISTROPHE II

 But thou, take courage, when the time is come
         For action, and cry out,
         Shouting thy father's name,
 When she shall cry aloud the name of “son,”
 And work thou out a woe that none will blame.


                             ANTISTROPHE IV

         And have thou in thy breast
         The heart that Perseus had,[448]
         And for thy friends beneath,
         And those on earth who dwell,
         Go thou and work the deed
         Acceptable to them,                                         820
         Of bitter, wrathful mood,
         And consummate within
         *The loathly work of blood;
 [And bidding Vengeance come as thine ally,]
         Destroy the murderer.

                            _Enter_ ÆGISTHOS

 _Ægis._ Not without summons came I, but by word
 Of courier fetched, and learn that travellers bring
 Their tale of tidings new, in no wise welcome.
 As for Orestes' death, with it to charge
 The house would be a burden dropping fear
 To one by that old bloodshed sorely stung.[449]
 How shall I count these things? As clear and true?
 Or are they vague reports of woman's fears,                         830
 That leap up high and die away to nought?
 What can'st thou say that will my mind inform?

 _Chor._ We heard, 'tis true; but go thou in and ask
 Of these same strangers. Nought is found in words
 Of messengers like asking, man from man.

 _Ægis._ I wish to see and probe the messenger,
 If he himself were present at the death,
 Or tells it hearing of a vague report:
 They shall not cheat a mind with eyes wide open.

                                                                 [_Exit_

 _Chor._ Zeus! Zeus! what words shall I                       840
         Now speak, whence start in prayer,
         *Invoking help of Gods?
         How with all wish for good
         Shall I speak fitting words?
         For now the sharp sword-points,
         Red with the blood of man,
         Will either work for aye
         The utter overthrow
         Of Agamemnon's house,
         Or, kindling fire and torch
         For freedom thus achieved,
         Will he the sceptre wield
         Of duly-ordered sway,
         His father's pride and state:                               850
         Such is the contest he,
         Orestes, godlike one,
         Now wages all alone,
         The one sole combatant,[450]
         In place of him who fell,
 Against those twain. May victory be his!

 _Ægisth._ [_groaning within_] Ah! ah! Woe's me!

 _Chor._ Hark! hark! How goes it now?
 What issue has been wrought within the house?
 Let us hold back while they the deed are doing,
 That we may seem as guiltless of these ills:
 For surely now the fight has reached its end.

                 _Enter_ Servant _from the chief door_

 _Serv._ Alas! alas! my master perishes!                      860
 Alas! alas! a third time yet I call.
 Ægisthos is no more; but open now
 With all your speed, and loosen ye the bolts
 That bar the women's gates. A man's full strength
 Is needed; not indeed that that would help
 A man already slain.

                         [_Rushes to the gate of the woman's half of the
                             palace_

                         Ho there! I say:
 I speak to the deaf; to those that sleep I utter
 In vain my useless cries. And where is she?
 Where's Clytæmnestra? What doth she do now?
 Her neck upon the razor's edge doth seem
 To fall, down-stricken by a vengeance just.                         870

               _Enter_ CLYTÆMNESTRA _from the side door_

 _Clytæm._ What means all this? What cry is this thou mak'st?

 _Serv._ I say the dead are killing one who lives.

 _Clytæm._ Ah, me! I see the drift of thy dark speech;
 By guile we perish, as of old we slew:
 Let some one hand at once axe strong to slay;
 Let's see if we are conquered or can conquer,
 For to that point of evil am I come.

          _Enter_ ORESTES _and_ PYLADES _from the other door_

 _Orest._ 'Tis thou I seek: he there has had enough.

 _Clytæm._ Ah me! my loved Ægisthos! Art thou dead?

 _Orest._ Lov'st thou the man? Then in the self-same tomb     880
 Shalt thou now lie, nor in his death desert him.

 _Clytæm._ [_baring her bosom_] Hold, boy! Respect
 this breast of mine, my son,[451]
 Whence thou full oft, asleep, with toothless gums,
 Hast sucked the milk that sweetly fed thy life.

 _Orest._ What shall I do, my Pylades? Shall I
 Through this respect forbear to slay my mother?

 _Pyl._[452] Where, then, are Loxias' other oracles,
 The Pythian counsels, and the fast-sworn vows?
 Have all men hostile rather than the Gods.

 _Orest._ My judgment goes with thine; thou speakest well:
 [_To_ CLYTÆMNESTRA] Follow: I mean to slay thee where he lies,890
 For while he lived thou held'st him far above
 My father. Sleep thou with him in thy death,
 Since thou lov'st him, and whom thou should'st love hatest.

 _Clytæm._ I reared thee, and would fain grow old with thee.

 _Orest._ What! Thou live with me, who did'st slay my father?

 _Clytæm._ Fate, O my son, must share the blame of that.

 _Orest._ This fatal doom, then, it is Fate that sends.

 _Clytæm._ Dost thou not fear a parent's curse, my son?

 _Orest._ Thou, though my mother, did'st to ill chance cast me.

 _Clytæm._ No outcast thou, so sent to house allied.          900

 _Orest._ I was sold doubly, though of free sire born.

 _Clytæm._ Where is the price, then, that I got for thee?

 _Orest._ I shrink for shame from pressing that charge home.

 _Clytæm._ Nay, tell thy father's wantonness as well.

 _Orest._ Blame not the man who toils when thou'rt at ease.[453]

 _Clytæm._ 'Tis hard, my son, for wives to miss their husband.

 _Orest._ The husband's toil keeps her that sits at home.[453]

 _Clytæm._ Thou seem'st, my son, about to slay thy mother.

 _Orest._ It is not I that slay thee, but thyself.

 _Clytæm._ Take heed, beware a mother's vengeful hounds.[454] 910

 _Orest._ How, slighting this, shall I escape my father's?

 _Clytæm._ I seem in life to wail as to a tomb.[455]

 _Orest._ My father's fate ordains this doom for thee.

 _Clytæm._ Ah me! the snake is here I bare and nursed.[456]

 _Orest._ An o'er-true prophet was that dread dream-born;
 Thou slewest one thou never should'st have slain,
 Now suffer fate should never have been thine.

                       [_Exit_ ORESTES, _leading_ CLYTÆMNESTRA _into the
                           palace, and followed by_ PYLADES

 _Chor._ E'en of these two I wail the twin mischance;
 But since long line of murder culminates
 In poor Orestes, this we yet accept,
 That he, our one light, fall not utterly.                           920


                               STROPHE I

 Late came due vengeance on the sons of Priam,
         Just forfeit of sore woe;—
 Late came there too to Agamemnon's house,
         Twin lions, twofold Death.[457]
 The exile who obeyed the Pythian hest
         Hath gained his full desire,
 Sped on his way by counsel from the Gods.


                               STROPHE II

 Shout ye, loud shout for the escape from ills
         Our master's house has seen,
 And from the wasting of his ancient wealth
         By that defilèd pair,                                       930
         Ill fate intolerable.


                             ANTISTROPHE I

 And so on one who loves the war of guile
         Revenge came subtle-souled;
 And in the strife of hands the child of Zeus
         In very deed gave help,
 (We mortals call her Vengeance, hitting well
         The meetest name for her,)
 Breathing destroying wrath against her foes.


                              STROPHE III

 She, she it is whom Loxias summons now,                             940
 Who dwelleth in Parnassia's cavern vast,
         *Calling on her who still
         *Is guileful without guile,
 *Halting of foot and tarrying over-long:
 The will of Gods is strangely overruled;
         It may not help the vile;[458]
 'Tis meet to adore the Power that rules in Heaven:
         At last we see the light.


                             ANTISTROPHE II

 *Now is the bit that curbed the slaves ta'en off:[459]
         Arise, arise, O house:
 Too long, too long, all prostrate on the ground                     950
         Ye have been used to lie.
        ·       ·       ·       ·       ·


                            ANTISTROPHE III

 Quickly all-working Time will bring a change
 Across the threshold of the palace old,
         When from the altar-hearth
         It shall drive all the guilt,
 With cleansing rites that chase away our woes;
 And Fortune's throws shall fall with gladsome cast,
           *Once more benign to see,[460]
 For new-come strangers settled in the house:
           At last we see the light.

  _Enter_ ORESTES, PYLADES, _and followers from the palace. His
        attendants bear the robe in which_ AGAMEMNON _had been murdered_

 _Orest._ See ye this country's tyrant rulers twain,          960
 My father's murderers, wasters of his house;
 Stately were they, seen sitting on their thrones,
 Friends too e'en now, to argue from their fate,
 Whose oaths are kept to every pledge they gave.
 Firmly they swore that they would slay my father,
 And die together. Well those oaths are kept:
 And ye who hear these ills, behold ye now
 Their foul device, as bonds for my poor father,
 Handcuffs, and fetters both his feet to bind.
 Come, stretch it out, and standing all around,                      970
 Show ye the snare that wrapt him o'er, that He
 May see, our Father,—not of mine I speak,
 But the great Sun that looks on all we do,—
 My mother's deeds, defilèd and impure,
 That He may be a witness in my cause,
 That I did justly bring this doom to pass
 Upon my mother.... Of Ægisthos' fate
 No word I speak. He bears the penalty,
 As runs the law, of an adulterer's guilt;
 But she who planned this crime against a man
 By whom she knew the weight of children borne
 Beneath her girdle, once a burden loved,
 But now, as it is proved, a grievous ill,                           980
 What seems she to you? Had she viper been,
 Or fell myræna,[461] she with touch alone,
 *Rather than bite, had made a festering sore
 With that bold daring of unrighteous mood.
 What shall I call it, using mildest speech?
 A wild beast's trap?—a pall that wraps a bier,
 And hides a dead man's feet?—A net, I trow,
 A snare, a robe entangling, one might call it.
 Such might be owned by one to plunder trained,
 Practised in duping travellers, and the life
 That robs men of their money; with this trap                        990
 Destroying many, many deeds of ill
 His fevered brain might hatch. May such as she
 Ne'er share my dwelling! May the hand of God
 Far rather smite me that I childless die!

 _Chor._ [_looking on_ AGAMEMNON'S _robe._] Ah me! ah me! these deeds
    most miserable!
 By hateful murder thou wast done to death.
         Woe, woe is me!
 And evil buds and blooms for him that's left.

 _Orest._ Was the deed hers or no? Lo! this same robe
 Bears witness how she dyed Ægisthos' sword,
 And the blood-stain helps Time's destroying work,                  1000
 Marring full many a tint of pattern fair:
 *Now name I it, now as eye-witness wail;[462]
 And calling on this robe that slew my father,
 Moan for all done and suffered, wail my race,
 Bearing the foul stains of this victory.

 _Chor._ No mortal man shall live a life unharmed,
 *Stout-hearted and rejoicing evermore.
         Woe, woe is me!
 One trouble vexes now, another comes.

 _Orest._ (_wildly, as one distraught._) Nay, know ye—for I know not how
    'twill end;1010
 Like chariot-driver with his steeds I'm dragged
 Out of my course; for passion's moods uncurbed
 Bear me their victim headlong. At my heart
 Stands terror ready or to sing or dance
 In burst of frenzy. While my reason stays,
 I tell my friends here that I slew my mother,
 Not without right, my father's murderess,
 Accursed, and hated of the Gods. And I
 As chiefest spell that made me dare this deed
 Count Loxias, Pythian prophet, warning me
 That doing this I should be free from blame,                       1020
 But slighting.... I pass o'er the penalty[463]....
 For none, aim as he will, such woes will hit.
 And now ye see me, in what guise equipped,

                       [_Putting on the suppliant's wreaths of wool, and
                           taking an olive branch in his hand_

 With this my bough and chaplet I will gain
 Earth's central shrine, the home where Loxias dwells,
 And the bright fire that is as deathless known,[464]
 Seeking to 'scape this guilt of kindred blood;
 And on no other hearth, so Loxias bade,
 May I seek shelter. And I charge you all,
 Ye Argives, bear ye witness in due time                            1030
 How these dark deeds of wretched ill were wrought:
 But I, a wanderer, exiled from my land,
 Shall live, and leaving these my prayers in death,...

 _Chor._ Nay, thou hast prospered: burden not thy lips
 With evil speech, nor speak ill-boding words,
 When thou hast freed the Argive commonwealth,
 By good chance lopping those two serpents' heads.

                      [_The Erinnyes are seen in the background, visible
                          to_ ORESTES _only, in black robes, and with
                          snakes in their hair_

 _Orest._ Ah! ah! ye handmaids: see, like Gorgons these,
 Dark-robed, and all their tresses hang entwined
 With many serpents. I can bear no more.

 _Chor._ What phantoms vex thee, best beloved of sons        1040
 By thy dear sire? Hold, fear not, victory's thine.

 _Orest._ These are no phantom terrors that I see:
 Full clear they are my mother's vengeful hounds.

 _Chor._ The blood fresh-shed is yet upon thy hands,
 And thence it is these troubles haunt thy soul.

 _Orest._ O King Apollo! See, they swarm, they swarm,
 And from their eyes is dropping loathsome blood.

 _Chor._ One way of cleansing is there; Loxias' form
 Clasp thou, and he will free thee from these ills.

 _Orest._ These forms ye see not, but I see them there:
 They drive me on, and I can bear no more.           [_Exit_

 _Chor._ Well, may'st thou prosper; may the gracious God     1050
 Watch o'er and guard thee with a chance well timed!

 Here, then, upon this palace of our kings
         A third storm blows again;
 The blast that haunts the race has run its course.
 First came the wretched meal of children's flesh;
         Next what befell our king:
 Slain in the bath was he who ruled our host,
         Of all the Achæans lord;
 And now a third has come, we know not whence,[465]
         To save ... or shall I say,
         To work a doom of death?
 Where will it end? Where will it cease at last,
         The mighty Atè dread,
         Lulled into slumber deep?

Footnote 401:

  Hermes is invoked, (1) as the watcher over the souls of the dead in
  Hades, and therefore the natural patron of the murdered Agamemnon; (2)
  as exercising an authority delegated by Zeus, and therefore capable of
  being, like Zeus himself, the deliverer and helper of suppliants. So
  Electra, further on, invokes Hermes in the same character. The line
  may, however, be rendered,

             “Who stand'st as guardian of my father's house.”

  The three opening lines are noticeable, as having been chosen by
  Aristophanes as the special object for his satirical criticism
  (_Frogs_, 1126-1176), abounding in a good score of ambiguities and
  tautologies.

Footnote 402:

  The words point to the two symbolic aspects of one and the same
  practice. In both there are some points of analogy with the earlier
  and later forms of the Nazarite vow among the Jews. (1) As being part
  of the body, and yet separable from it without mutilation, it became
  the representative of the whole man, and as such was the sign of a
  votive dedication. As early as Homer, it was the custom of youths to
  keep one long, flowing lock as consecrated, and when they reached
  manhood, they cut it off, and offered it to the river-god of their
  country, throwing it into the stream, as that to which, directly and
  indirectly, they owed their nurture. Here the offering is made to
  Inachos, as the hero-founder of Argos, identified with the river that
  bore his name. (2) They shaved their head, wholly or in part, as a
  token as a token of grief, and then, because true grief for the dead
  was an acceptable and propitiatory offering, this became the natural
  offering for suppliants who offered their prayers at the tombs of the
  departed. So in the _Aias_ of Sophocles (v. 1174) Teucros calls on
  Eurysakes to approach the corpse of his father, holding in his hand
  locks of his own hair, his mother's, and that of Teucros. In the
  offering which Achilles makes over the grave of Patroclos of the hair
  which he had cherished for the river-god of his fatherland,
  Spercheios, we have the union of the two customs. Homer. _Il._ xxiii.
  141-151.

Footnote 403:

  After the widespread fashion of the East, the handmaids of
  Clytæmnestra (originally Troïan captives) had to rend their clothes,
  beat their breasts, and lacerate their faces till the blood came. The
  higher civilisation of Solon's laws had forbidden these wild,
  barbarous forms of grief at Athens. Plutarch, _Solon_, p. 164.

Footnote 404:

  Purposely, perhaps, obscure. They seem to say that the old reverence
  for Agamemnon has passed away, and instead of it there is only a
  slavish fear for Ægisthos. For the more acute, however, they imply
  that those who have cause to fear are Ægisthos and Clytæmnestra
  themselves.

Footnote 405:

  The words, in their generalising sententiousness, refer specially to
  the twofold crime of Ægisthos as an adulterer and murderer. Then, in
  the Epode, the Chorus justify themselves for their seeming
  inconsistency in thus abhorring the guilt, and yet acting as
  instruments of the guilty in their attempts to escape punishment.

Footnote 406:

  The mourners speak, of course, of Agamemnon and Orestes, not of
  Ægisthos and Clytæmnestra.

Footnote 407:

  A mixture of meal, honey, and oil formed the half-liquid substance
  commonly used for these funereal libations. The “garlands” may be
  wreaths of flowers or fillets, or the word may be used figuratively
  for the libation itself, as crowning the mound in which Agamemnon lay.

Footnote 408:

  The words point to a strange Athenian custom. When a house was
  cleansed of that which defiled it, morally or physically, the filth
  was carried in an earthen vessel to a place where three ways met, and
  the worshipper flung the vessel behind him, and walked away without
  turning to look at it. To Electra's mind, the libation which her
  mother sends is equally unclean, and should be treated in the same
  way. So in Hom. _Il._ i. 314, the Argives purify themselves, and then
  cast the lustral water they have used into the sea. Lev. vi. 11, gives
  us an analogous usage. Comp. also Theocritos, _Idyll_ xxiv., vv.
  22-97.

Footnote 409:

  Partly it is the youth of Electra that seeks counsel from those who
  had more experience; partly she shrinks from the responsibility of
  being the first to utter the formula of execration.

Footnote 410:

  The word “escort” has a special reference to the function of Hermes in
  the unseen world. As he was wont to act as guide to the souls of the
  dead in their downward journey, so now Electra prays that he may lead
  the blessings she asks for upward from the dark depths of Earth.

Footnote 411:

  The Skythian bow, long and elastic, bending either way, like those of
  the Arabians (Herod. vii. 69). The connection of Ares with the wild,
  fierce tribes of Thrakia and Skythia meets us again and again in the
  literature of Greece. He was the only God to whom they built temples
  (_ibid._ iv. 59). They sacrificed human victims to an iron sword as
  his more appropriate symbol (iv. 62). The use of iron for weapons of
  war came to the Greeks from them (_Seven ag. Th._ 729; _Prom._ 714).

Footnote 412:

  It may be worth while to compare the method adopted by the three
  dramatists of Greece in bringing about the recognition of the brother
  by the sister. (1) Here the lock of hair, in its peculiar colour and
  texture resembling her own, followed by the likeness of his footsteps
  to hers, prepares the way first for vague anticipations, and then the
  robe she had made for him, leads to her acceptance of Orestes on his
  own discovery of himself. To this it has been objected, by Euripides
  in the first instance (_Electra_, vv. 462-500), that the evidence of
  the colour of the hair is weak, that a young man's foot must have been
  larger than a maiden's, and that he could not have worn as a man the
  garment she had made for him as a child. It might be replied, perhaps,
  that there are such things as hereditary resemblances extending to the
  colour of the hair and the arch of the instep, and that the robe may
  either have been shown instead of worn, or, being worn, have been
  adapted for the larger growth. (2) In the _Electra_ of Sophocles the
  lock of hair alone convinces Chrysothemis that her brother is near at
  hand (v. 900), while Electra herself requires the further evidence of
  Agamemnon's seal (v. 1223). In Euripides (v. 527), all proof fails
  till Orestes shows a scar on his brow, which his sister remembers.

Footnote 413:

  The saying is probably one of the widespread proverbs which imply
  parables. The idea is obviously that with which we are familiar in the
  Gospel “grain of mustard seed.” Here, as in the “kicking against the
  pricks” of Acts ix. 5, xxvi. 14, and _Agam._ v. 1604, we are carried
  back to a period which lies beyond the range of history as that in
  which men took note of the analogies and embodied them in forms like
  this.

Footnote 414:

  So in the _Odyssey_ (xix. 228), Odysseus appears as wearing a woollen
  cloak, on which are embroidered the figures of a fawn and a dog.

Footnote 415:

  An obvious reproduction of the words of Andromache (_Il._ vi. 429).

Footnote 416:

  The words seem to imply that burning alive was known among the Greeks
  as a punishment for the most atrocious crimes. The “oozing pitch,” if
  we adopt that rendering, apparently describes something like the
  “_tunica molesta_” of Juvenal. (_Sat._ viii. 235.) Hesychios (s. v.
  Κωνῆσαι) mentions the practice as alluded to in a lost play of
  Æschylos.

Footnote 417:

  The words are both doubtful and obscure. Taking the reading which I
  have adopted, they seem to mean that while men in general had means of
  propitiating the Erinnyes and other Powers for the guilt of unavenged
  bloodshed, Orestes and Electra had no such way of escape open to them.
  If they, the next of kin, failed to do their work, they would be
  exposed to the full storm of wrath. But a conjectural emendation of
  one word gives us,

                “For making known to men the earth-born ills
                That come from wrathful Powers.”

Footnote 418:

  Either that old age would come prematurely, or that the hair itself
  would share the leprous whiteness of the flesh.

Footnote 419:

  The words, as taken in the text, refer to Orestes seeing even in sleep
  the spectral forms of the Erinnyes. By some editors the verse is
  placed after v. 276, and the lines then read thus:—

          “And that he calls fresh onsets of the Erinnyes
          As brought to issue from a father's blood,
          Seeing clearly, though he move his brow in darkness.”

  So taken, the last line refers to Agamemnon, who, though in the
  darkness of Hades, sees the penalties which will fail upon his son
  should he neglect to take vengeance on his father's murderers.

Footnote 420:

  Stress is laid here, as in _Agam._ 1224, on the effeminacy of the
  adulterer.

Footnote 421:

  The great law of retribution is repeated from _Agam._ 1564. As one of
  the earliest utterances of man's moral sense, it was referred
  popularly among the Greeks to Rhadamanthos, who with Minos judged the
  souls of the dead in Hades. Comp. Aristot. _Ethic. Nicom._, v. 8.

Footnote 422:

  The funeral pyre, which consumes the body, leaves the life and power
  of the man untouched. The spirit survives, and calls on the Gods that
  dwell in darkness to avenge him. The very cry of wailing tends, as a
  prayer to them, to the exposure of the murderer.

Footnote 423:

  The Lykians, of whom Glaucos and Sarpedon are the representative
  heroes in the _Iliad_, are named as the chief allies of the Troïans.

Footnote 424:

  The words embody the widespread feeling that the absence of funereal
  honours affected the spirit of the dead, and that the souls with whom
  he dwelt held him in high or low esteem according as they had been
  given or withheld.

Footnote 425:

  Pindar (_Pyth._ x. 47), the contemporary of Æschylos, had made the
  name of these Hyperborei well known to all Greeks. The vague dreams of
  men, before the earth had been searched out, pictured a happy land as
  lying beyond their reach. There were Islands of the Blest in the far
  West; Æthiopians, peaceful and long-lived, in the South; and far away,
  beyond the cold North, a people exempt from the common evils of
  humanity. The latter have been connected with the old Aryan belief in
  the paradise of Mount Meru. Comp. also Herod. iv. 421; _Prom._ 812.

Footnote 426:

  _Sc._, the beating of both hands upon the breast, as the Chorus
  uttered their lamentations.

Footnote 427:

  Perhaps, simply “the sharp and bitter cry.” But the rendering in the
  text seems justified as repeating the wish already expressed (v. 260),
  that the murderers may die by this form of death.

Footnote 428:

  The Chorus at this point renew their words and cries of lamentation,
  smiting on their breasts. By some critics this speech and Antistrophe
  VII. are assigned to Electra, Antistrophe VIII. to the Chorus, with a
  corresponding change in the pronouns “my” and “thy.” The Chorus, as
  consisting of Troïan captives, is represented as adopting the more
  vehement Asiatic forms of wailing. Among these the Arians, Kissians,
  and Mariandynians (_Pers._ 920) seem to have been most conspicuous for
  their skill in lamentation, and, as such, were in request where hired
  mourners were wanted. Compare the opening chorus, v. 22.

Footnote 429:

  The practice of mutilating the corpse of a murdered man by cutting off
  his hands and feet and fastening them round his waist, seems to have
  been looked on as rendering him powerless to seek for vengeance. Comp.
  Soph. _Elect._ v. 437. This kind of mutilation, and not mere wanton
  outrage, is what the Chorus refer to.

Footnote 430:

  As in v. 351 the loss of honour among the dead was represented as one
  consequence of the absence of funereal rites from those who loved the
  dead, so here the restoration of the children to their rights appears
  as the condition without which that dishonour must continue. If they
  succeed, then, and then only, can they offer funereal banquets, year
  by year, as was the custom. There may be a special reference to an
  Argive custom mentioned by Plutarch (_Quæst. Græc._, c. 24) of
  sacrificing immediately after the death of a relative to Apollo, and
  thirty days later to Hermes.

Footnote 431:

  Another reference to the third cup of undiluted wine which men drank
  to the honour of Zeus the Preserver. Comp. _Agam._ v. 245.

Footnote 432:

  Possibly the pronoun refers to Pylades.

Footnote 433:

  The story of Althæa has perhaps been made most familiar to English
  readers by Mr. Swinburne's _Atalanta in Calydon_. More briefly told,
  the legend ran that she, being the wife of Œneus, bare a son, who was
  believed to be the child of Ares—that the Fates came to her when the
  boy, who was named Meleagros, was seven days old, and told her that
  his life should last until the firebrand then burning on the earth
  should be consumed. She took the firebrand and quenched it, and laid
  it by in a chest; but when Meleagros grew up, he joined in the chase
  of the great boar of Calydon, and when he had slain it, gave the skin
  as a trophy to Atalanta, and when his mother's brothers, the sons of
  Thestios, claimed it as their right, he waxed wroth with them and slew
  them. And then Althæa, in her grief, caring more for her brothers than
  her son, took the brand from the chest, and threw it into the fire,
  and so Meleagros died. Phrynichos is said to have made the myth the
  subject of a drama. In Homer (_Il._ x. 566), Althæa brings about her
  son's death by her curses.

Footnote 434:

  Skylla (not to be confounded with the sea-monster of Messina) was the
  daughter of Nisos, king of Megaris, who had on his head a lock of
  purple hair, which was a charm that preserved his life from all
  danger. And the Cretans under Minos attacked Nisos, and besieged him
  in his city; and Minos won the love of Skylla, and tempted her with
  gifts, and she cut off her father's lock of hair, and so he perished.
  But Minos, scorning her for her deed, bound her by the feet to the
  stern of his ship and drowned her.

Footnote 435:

  Hermes, _i.e._, in his office as the escort of the souls of the dead
  to Hades.

Footnote 436:

  The Chorus apparently is represented as on the point of completing its
  catalogue of crimes committed by women with the story of
  Clytæmnestra's guilt. Something leads them to check themselves, and
  they are contented with a dark and vague allusion.

Footnote 437:

  The story of the Lemnian women is told by Herodotos (vi. 138). They
  rose up against their husbands and put them all to death; and the deed
  passed into a proverb, so that all great crimes were spoken of as
  Lemnian. This guilt is that alluded to in Strophe III.

Footnote 438:

  In every case of which the Chorus had spoken guilt had been followed
  by retribution. So, it is implied, it will be in that which is present
  to their thoughts.

Footnote 439:

  _Sc._, is not forgotten or overlooked, but will assuredly meet with
  its due punishment.

Footnote 440:

  So in Homer (_Il._ xxii. 444), the warm bath is prepared by Andromache
  for Hector on his return from the battle in which he fell.

Footnote 441:

  As in her speeches in the _Agamemnon_ (vv. 595, 884), Clytæmestra's
  words here also are full of significant ambiguity. The “things that
  befit the house,” the proposed conference with Ægisthos, her
  separation of Orestes from his companions, are all indications of
  suspicion already half aroused. The last three lines were probably
  spoken as an “aside.”

Footnote 442:

  Suasion is personified, and invoked to come and win Clytæmnestra to
  trust herself in the power of the two avengers.

Footnote 443:

  An alternative rendering is,

              “Nay, say not that to him with show of hate.”

Footnote 444:

  Apollo in the shrine at Delphi.

Footnote 445:

  Hermes invoked once more, as at once the patron of craft and the
  escort of the dead.

Footnote 446:

  Or “before our eyes.”

Footnote 447:

  The “treasured score” is explained by the words that follow to mean
  the cry of exultation which the Chorus will raise when the deed of
  vengeance is accomplished; or, possibly (as Mr. Paley suggests), the
  funereal wail over the bodies of Ægisthos and Clytæmnestra, which the
  Chorus would raise to avert the guilt of the murder from Orestes.

Footnote 448:

  As Perseus could only overcome the Gorgon, Medusa, by turning away his
  eyes, lest looking on her he should turn to stone, so Orestes was to
  avoid meeting his mother's glance, lest that should unman him and
  blunt his purpose.

Footnote 449:

  Ægisthos had suffered enough, he says, for his share in Agamemnon's
  death. He has no wish that fresh odium should fall on him, as being
  implicated also in the death of Orestes, of which he has just heard.

Footnote 450:

  The word (_ephedros_) was applied technically to one who sat by during
  a conflict between two athletes, prepared to challenge the victor to a
  fresh encounter. Orestes is such a combatant, taking the place of
  Agamemnon.

Footnote 451:

  So, in Homer (_Il._ xxii. 79), Hecuba, when the entreaties of Priam
  had been in vain, makes this last appeal—

             “Then to the front his mother rushed, in tears,
             Her bosom bare, with either hand her breast
             Sustaining, and with tears addressed him thus,
             'Hector, my son, thy mother's breast revere.'”

Footnote 452:

  The reader will note this as the only speech put into the lips of
  Pylades, though he is present as accompanying Orestes throughout great
  part of the drama.

Footnote 453:

  The different ethical standard applied to the guilt of the husband and
  the wife was, we may well believe, that which prevailed among the
  Athenians generally. It has only too close a parallel in the ballads
  and romances of our own early literature.

Footnote 454:

  The line is memorable as prophetic of the whole plot of the
  _Eumenides._

Footnote 455:

  The phrase “wail as to a tomb” seems to have been a by-word for
  fruitless entreaty and lamentation.

Footnote 456:

  Clytæmnestra sees now the important of the dream referred to in vv.
  518-522.

Footnote 457:

  The words must be left in their obscurity. Commentators have
  conjectured Orestes and Pylades, or the deaths of Agamemnon and
  Iphigeneia, or those of Ægisthos and Clytæmnestra, as the “two lions,”
  spoken of. The first seems most in harmony with the context.

Footnote 458:

  The Eternal Justice which orders all things is mightier than any
  arbitrary will, such as men attribute to the Gods. That will, even if
  we dare to think of it as changeable or evil, is held in restraint. It
  cannot, even if it would, protect the evildoers.

Footnote 459:

  The Chorus feel that they have been too long silent; now, at last,
  they can speak. As slaves dreading punishment they had been gagged
  before; now the gag is removed.

Footnote 460:

  Or, “Once more for those who wail.”

Footnote 461:

  It is not clear with what form of animal life the _myræna_ is to be
  identified. The ideal implied is that of some sea-monster whose touch
  was poisonous, but this does not hold good of the “lamprey.”

Footnote 462:

  As the text stands, Orestes says that at last he can speak of the
  murder over which he had long brooded in silence. Another reading
  makes him speak of the oscillations in his own mind—

              “Now do I praise myself, now wail and blame.”

Footnote 463:

  Comp. vv. 270-288.

Footnote 464:

  Delphi was to the Greek (as Jerusalem was to mediæval Christendom) the
  centre at once of his religious life and of the material earth. Its
  rock was the _omphalos_ of the world. Consecrated widows watched over
  the sacred and perpetual fire. Once only up to the time of Æschylos,
  when the Temple itself was desecrated by the Persians, had it ceased
  to burn.

Footnote 465:

  Once again we have the thought of the third cup offered as a libation
  to Zeus as saviour and deliverer. The Chorus asks whether this third
  deed of blood will be true to that idea and work out deliverance.
