Context: After being trapped in a cell with Count Deku, the jedi leave the
pirates and let them go free.

Obi-Wan: We have no quarrell with you, and jedi do not seek revenge. Our
errands are with matters that do not involve you. Let's leave while we're
square.
Pirate: How very honorable of you.
Obi-Wan: Indeed, but I must warn you, Count Deku does not share that same
honor, and he knows where you live.
