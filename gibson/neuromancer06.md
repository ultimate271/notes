# SIX

## Case gets in to the London Database with the help of the Flatline and finds Colonel Willis Corto, whose eyes match those of Armitage
“YOU WANT YOU a paradise,” the Flatline advised, when Case had explained his
situation. “Check Copenhagen, fringes of the university section.” The voice
recited coordinates as he punched.

They found their paradise, a “pirate’s paradise,” on the jumbled border of a
low-security academic grid. At first glance it resembled the kind of graffiti
student operators sometimes left at the junctions of grid lines, faint glyphs
of colored light that shimmered against the confused outlines of a dozen arts
faculties.

“There,” said the Flatline, “the blue one. Make it out? That’s an entry code
for Bell Europa. Fresh, too. Bell’ll get in here soon and read the whole damn
board, change any codes they find posted. Kids’ll steal the new ones tomorrow.”

Case tapped his way into Bell Europa and switched to a standard phone code.
With the Flatline’s help, he connected with the London data base that Molly
claimed was Armitage’s.

“Here,” said the voice, “I’ll do it for you.” The Flatline began to chant a
series of digits, Case keying them on his deck, trying to catch the pauses the
construct used to indicate timing. It took three tries.

“Big deal,” said the Flatline. “No ice at all.”

“Scan this shit,” Case told the Hosaka. “Sift for owner’s personal history.”

The neuroelectronic scrawls of the paradise vanished, replaced by a simple
lozenge of white light. “Contents are primarily video recordings of postwar
military trials,” said the distant voice of the Hosaka. “Central figure is
Colonel Willis Corto.”

“Show it already,” Case said.

A man’s face filled the screen. The eyes were Armitage’s.

## Backstory on Willis Corto
TWO HOURS LATER, Case fell beside Molly on the slab and let the temperfoam mold
itself against him.

“You find anything?” she asked, her voice fuzzy with sleep and drugs.

### Case watches recordings and records to discover that he got fucked in a Screaming Fist mission.
“Tell you later,” he said, “I’m wrecked.” He was hungover and confused. He lay
there, eyes closed, and tried to sort the various parts of a story about a man
called Corto. The Hosaka had sorted a thin store of data and assembled a
precis, but it was full of gaps. Some of the material had been print records,
reeling smoothly down the screen, too quickly, and Case had had to ask the
computer to read them for him. Other segments were audio recordings of the
Screaming Fist hearing.

Willis Corto, Colonel, had plummeted through a blind spot in the Russian
defenses over Kirensk. The shuttles had created the hole with pulse bombs, and
Corto’s team had dropped in in Nightwing microlights, their wings snapping taut
in moonlight, reflected in jags of silver along the rivers Angara and
Podhamennaya, the last light Corto would see for fifteen months. Case tried to
imagine the microlights blossoming out of their launch capsules, high above a
frozen steppe.

“They sure as hell did shaft you, boss,” Case said, and Molly stirred beside
him.

The microlights had been unarmed, stripped to compensate for the weight of a
console operator, a prototype deck, and a virus program called Mole IX, the
first true virus in the history of cybernetics. Corto and his team had been
training for the run for three years. They were through the ice, ready to
inject Mole IX, when the emps went off. The Russian pulse guns threw the
jockeys into electronic darkness; the Nightwings suffered systems crash, flight
circuitry wiped clean.

Then the lasers opened up, aiming on infrared, taking out the fragile,
radar-transparent assault planes, and Corto and his dead console man fell out
of a Siberian sky. Fell and kept falling. . . .

### In the aftermath, Corto gives a politically motivated speech to cover up scandal in exchange for medical repairs
There were gaps in the story, here, where Case scanned documents concerning the
flight of a commandeered Russian gunship that managed to reach Finland. To be
gutted, as it landed in a spruce grove, by an antique twenty-millimeter cannon
manned by a cadre of reservists on dawn alert. Screaming Fist had ended for
Corto on the outskirts of Helsinki, with Finnish paramedics sawing him out of
the twisted belly of the helicopter. The war ended nine days later, and Corto
was shipped to a military facility in Utah, blind, legless, and missing most of
his jaw. It took eleven months for the Congressional aide to find him there. He
listened to the sound of tubes draining. In Washington and McLean, the show
trials were already underway. The Pentagon and the CIA were being Balkanized,
partially dismantled, and a Congressional investigation had focused on
Screaming Fist. Ripe for watergating, the aide told Corto.

He’d need eyes, legs, and extensive cosmetic work, the aide said, but that
could be arranged. New plumbing, the man added, squeezing Corto’s shoulder
through the sweat-damp sheet.

Corto heard the soft, relentless dripping. He said he preferred to testify as
he was.

No, the aide explained, the trials were being televised. The trials needed to
reach the voter. The aide coughed politely.

Repaired, refurnished, and extensively rehearsed, Corto’s subsequent testimony
was detailed, moving, lucid, and largely the invention of a Congressional cabal
with certain vested interests in saving particular portions of the Pentagon
infrastructure. Corto gradually understood that the testimony he gave was
instrumental in saving the careers of three officers directly responsible for
the suppression of reports on the building of the emp installations at Kirensk.

### Being discarded by Washington, Corto surfaces a few places in some odd jobs, before the record ends
His role in the trials over, he was unwanted in Washington. In an M Street
restaurant, over asparagus crepes, the aide explained the terminal dangers
involved in talking to the wrong people. Corto crushed the man’s larynx with
the rigid fingers of his right hand. The Congressional aide strangled, his face
in an asparagus crepe, and Corto stepped out into cool Washington September.

The Hosaka rattled through police reports, corporate espionage records, and
news files. Case watched Corto work corporate defectors in Lisbon and
Marrakesh, where he seemed to grow obsessed with the idea of betrayal, to
loathe the scientists and technicians he bought out for his employers. Drunk,
in Singapore, he beat a Russian engineer to death in a hotel and set fire to
his room.

Next he surfaced in Thailand, as overseer of a heroin factory. Then as enforcer
for a California gambling cartel, then as a paid killer in the ruins of Bonn.
He robbed a bank in Wichita. The record grew vague, shadowy, the gaps longer.

One day, he said, in a taped segment that suggested chemical interrogation,
everything had gone gray.

Translated French medical records explained that a man without identification
had been taken to a Paris mental health unit and diagnosed as schizophrenic. He
became catatonic and was sent to a government institution on the outskirts of
Toulon. He became a subject in an experimental program that sought to reverse
schizophrenia through the application of cybernetic models. A random selection
of patients were provided with microcomputers and encouraged, with help from
students, to program them. He was cured, the only success in the entire
experiment.

The record ended there.

Case turned on the foam and Molly cursed him softly for disturbing her.

## Case gets a call from Armitage instructing him that Molly and he are flying to Istanbul
THE TELEPHONE RANG. He pulled it into bed. “Yeah?”

“We’re going to Istanbul,” Armitage said. “Tonight.”

“What does the bastard want?” Molly asked.

“Says we’re going to Istanbul tonight.”

“That’s just wonderful.”

Armitage was reading off flight numbers and departure times.

Molly sat up and turned on the light.

“What about my gear?” Case asked. “My deck.”

“Finn will handle it,” said Armitage, and hung up.

Case watched her pack. There were dark circles under her eyes, but even with
the cast on, it was like watching a dance. No wasted motion. His clothes were a
rumpled pile beside his bag.

“You hurting?” he asked.

“I could do with another night at Chin’s.”

“Your dentist?”

“You betcha. Very discreet. He’s got half that rack, full clinic. Does repairs
for samurai.” She was zipping her bag. “You ever been to ’Stambul?”

“Couple days, once.”

“Never changes,” she said. “Bad old town.”

## Molly reflects on her visit to Chiba as similar to this
“IT WAS LIKE this when we headed for Chiba,” Molly said, staring out the train
window at blasted industrial moonscape, red beacons on the horizon warning
aircraft away from a fusion plant. “We were in L.A. He came in and said Pack,
we were booked for Macau. When we got there, I played fantan in the Lisboa and
he crossed over into Zhongshan. Next day I was playing ghost with you in Night
City.” She took a silk scarf from the sleeve of her black jacket and polished
the insets. The landscape of the northern Sprawl woke confused memories of
childhood for Case, dead grass tufting the cracks in a canted slab of freeway
concrete.

The train began to decelerate ten kilometers from the airport. Case watched the
sun rise on the landscape of childhood, on broken slag and the rusting shells
of refineries.
