BOOK IV
XXV
§ 2
# § 2
At first the mental activities of Alexandria centred upon the Museum, and were
mainly scientific. Philosophy, which in a more vigorous age had been a doctrine
of power over self and the material world, without abandoning these
pretensions, became in reality a doctrine of secret consolation. The stimulant
changed into an opiate. The philosopher let the world, as the vulgar say, rip,
the world of which he was a part, and consoled himself by saying in very
beautiful and elaborate forms that the world was illusion and that there was in
him something quintessential and sublime, outside and above the world.
Athens,[207] politically insignificant, but still a great and crowded mart
throughout the fourth century, decaying almost imperceptibly so far as outer
seeming went, and treated with a strange respect that was half contempt by all
the warring powers and adventurers of the world, was the fitting centre of such
philosophical teaching. It was quite a couple of centuries before the schools
of Alexandria became as important in philosophical discussion.

But of Philo the Jew in the first century A.D., and of Plotinus in the third,
interesting as the thought and influence of these men were, the scale of this
outline will not permit us to treat.
