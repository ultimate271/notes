Nor is there any convincing evidence of man in America before the end of the
Pleistocene.[43] The same relaxation of the climate that permitted the retreat
of the reindeer hunters into Russia and Siberia, as the Neolithic tribes
advanced, may have allowed them to wander across the land that is now cut by
Bering Strait, and so reach the American continent. They spread thence
southward, age by age. When they reached South America, they found the giant
sloth (the _Megatherium_), the glyptodon, and many other extinct creatures,
still flourishing. The glyptodon was a monstrous South American armadillo, and
a human skeleton has been found by Roth buried beneath its huge tortoise-like
shell.[44]

All the human remains in America, even the earliest, it is to be noted, are of
an Amer-Indian character. In America there does not seem to have been any
preceding races of sub-men. Man was fully man when he entered America. The old
world was the nursery of the sub-races of mankind.
