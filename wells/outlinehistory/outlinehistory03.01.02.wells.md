# § 2
Among the earliest evidences of some creature, either human or at least more
man-like than any living ape upon earth, are a number of flints and stones very
roughly chipped and shaped so as to be held in the hand. These were probably
used as hand-axes. These early implements (“Eoliths”) are often so crude and
simple that there was for a long time a controversy whether they were to be
regarded as natural or artificial productions.[23] The date of the earliest of
them is put by geologists as Pliocene--that is to say, _before the First
Glacial Age_. They occur also throughout the First Interglacial period. We know
of no bones or other remains in Europe or America of the quasi-human beings of
half a million years ago, who made and used these implements. They used them to
hammer with, perhaps they used them to fight with, and perhaps they used bits
of wood for similar purposes.[24]

But at Trinil, in Java, in strata which are said to correspond either to the
later Pliocene or to the American and European First Ice Age, there have been
found some scattered bones of a creature, such as the makers of these early
implements may have been. The top of a skull, some teeth, and a thigh-bone have
been found. The skull shows a brain-case about half-way in size between that of
the chimpanzee and man, but the thigh-bone is that of a creature as well
adapted to standing and running as a man, and as free, therefore, to use its
hands. The creature was not a man, nor was it an arboreal ape like the
chimpanzee. It was a walking ape. It has been named by naturalists
_Pithecanthropus erectus_ (the walking ape-man). We cannot say that it is a
direct human ancestor, but we may guess that the creatures who scattered these
first stone tools over the world must have been closely similar and kindred,
and that our ancestor was a beast of like kind. This little trayful of bony
fragments from Trinil is, at present, apart from stone implements, the oldest
relic of early humanity, or of the close blood relations of early humanity,
that is known.

While these early men or “sub-men” were running about Europe four or five
hundred thousand years ago, there were mammoths, rhinoceroses, a huge
hippopotamus, a giant beaver, and a bison and wild cattle in their world. There
were also wild horses, and the sabre-toothed tiger still abounded. There are no
traces of lions or true tigers at that time in Europe, but there were bears,
otters, wolves, and a wild boar. It may be that the early sub-man sometimes
played jackal to the sabre-toothed tiger, and finished up the bodies on which
the latter had gorged itself.[25]
