# § 5
Guesses about the duration of the great age of cold are still vague, but in the
Time diagram on page 60 we follow H. F. Osborn in accepting as our guides the

[Illustration: TIME DIAGRAM OF THE GLACIAL AGES.

The reader should compare this diagram carefully with our first time diagram,
Chapter II, § 2, p. 14. That diagram, if it were on the same scale as this one,
would be between 41 and 410 feet long. The position of the Eoanthropus is very
uncertain: it may be as early as the Pliocene]
