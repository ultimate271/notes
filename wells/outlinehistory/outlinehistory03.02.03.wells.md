# § 3
When the Dutch discovered Tasmania, they found a detached human race not very
greatly advanced beyond this Lower Palæolithic stage. But over most of the
world the Lower Palæolithic culture had developed into a more complicated and
higher life twenty or thirty thousand years ago. The Tasmanians were not
racially Neanderthalers;[34] their brain-cases, their neck-bones, their jaws
and teeth, show that; they had no Neanderthal affinities; they were of the same
species as ourselves. There can be little doubt that throughout the hundreds of
centuries during which the scattered little groups of Neanderthal men were all
that represented men in Europe, real men, of our own species, in some other
part of the world, were working their way along parallel lines from much the
same stage as the Neanderthalers ended at, and which the Tasmanians preserved,
to a higher level of power and achievement. The Tasmanians, living under
unstimulating conditions, remote from any other human competition or example,
lagged behind the rest of the human brotherhood.[35]

About 200 centuries ago or earlier, real men of our own species, if not of our
own race, came drifting into the European area.
