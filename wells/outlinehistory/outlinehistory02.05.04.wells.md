# § 4
And while we are enumerating the forces that change climate and the conditions
of terrestrial life, we may perhaps look ahead a little and add a fourth set of
influences, at first unimportant in the history of the world so far as the land
surface is concerned, but becoming more important after the age of Reptiles, to
which we shall proceed in our next chapter. These are the effects produced upon
climate by life itself. Particularly great is the influence of vegetation, and
especially that of forests. Every tree is continually transpiring water vapour
into the air; the amount of water evaporated in summer by a lake surface is far
less than the amount evaporated by the same area of beech forest. As in the
later Mesozoic and the Cainozoic Age, great forests spread over the world,
their action in keeping the air moist and mitigating and stabilizing climate by
keeping the summer cool and the winter mild must have become more and more
important. Moreover, forests accumulate and protect soil and so prepare the
possibility of agricultural life.

Water-weeds again may accumulate to choke and deflect rivers, flood and convert
great areas into marshes, and so lead to the destruction of forests or the
replacement of grass-lands by boggy wildernesses.

Finally, with the appearance of human communities, came what is perhaps the
most powerful of all living influences upon climate. By fire and plough and axe
man alters his world. By destroying forests and by irrigation man has already
affected the climate of great regions of the world’s surface. The destruction
of forests makes the seasons more extreme; this has happened, for instance, in
the northeastern states of the United States of America. Moreover, the soil is
no longer protected from the scour of rain, and is washed away, leaving only
barren rock beneath. This has happened in Spain and Dalmatia and, some
thousands of years earlier, in South Arabia. By irrigation, on the other hand,
man restores the desert to life and mitigates climate. This process is going on
in Northwest India and Australia. In the future, by making such operations
worldwide and systematic, man may be able to control climate to an extent at
which as yet we can only guess.
