# § 7
The general drift of thought in the concluding years of the fourth century B.C.
was not with Aristotle, nor towards the laborious and necessary accumulation of
ordered knowledge. It is possible that without his endowments from the king he
would have made but a small figure in intellectual history. Through them he was
able to give his splendid intelligence substance and effect. The ordinary man
prefers easy ways so long as they may be followed, and is almost wilfully
heedless whether they end at last in a cul-de-sac. Finding the stream of events
too powerful to control at once, the generality of philosophical teachers
drifted in those days from the scheming of model cities and the planning of new
ways of living into the elaboration of beautiful and consoling systems of
evasion.

Perhaps that is putting things coarsely and unjustly. But let Professor Gilbert
Murray speak upon this matter.[192]

“The Cynics cared only for virtue and the relation of the soul to God; the
world and its learning and its honours were as dross to them. The Stoics and
Epicureans, so far apart at first sight, were very similar in their ultimate
aim. What they really cared about was ethics--the practical question how a man
should order his life. Both, indeed, gave themselves to some science--the
Epicureans to physics, the Stoics to logic and rhetoric--but only as a means to
an end. The Stoic tried to win men’s hearts and convictions by sheer subtlety
of abstract argument and dazzling sublimity of thought and expression. The
Epicurean was determined to make Humanity go its way without cringing to
capricious gods and without sacrificing Free-Will. He condensed his gospel into
four maxims: ‘God is not to be feared; Death cannot be felt; the Good can be
won; all that we dread can be borne and conquered.’”

And meanwhile the stream of events flowed on, with a reciprocal indifference to
philosophy.
