The history we need to tell here of India is simpler even than this brief
record of Egypt. Somewhere about the time of Hammurabi or later, a branch of
the Aryan-speaking people who then occupied North Persia and Afghanistan,
pushed down the northwest passes into India. They conquered their way until
they prevailed over all the darker populations of North India, and spread their
rule or influence over the whole peninsula. They never achieved any unity in
India; their history is a history of warring kings and republics. The Persian
empire, in the days of its expansion after the capture of Babylon, pushed its
boundaries beyond the Indus, and later Alexander the Great marched as far as
the border of the desert that separates the Punjab from the Ganges valley. But
with this bare statement we will for a time leave the history of India.
