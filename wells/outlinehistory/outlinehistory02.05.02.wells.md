Another entirely different cause of changes in the general climate of the earth
may be due to variations in the heat of the sun. We do not yet understand what
causes the heat of the sun or what sustains that undying fire. It is possible
that in the past there have been periods of greater and lesser intensity. About
that we know nothing; human experience has been too short; and so far we have
been able to find no evidence on this matter in the geological record. On the
whole, scientific men are inclined to believe that the sun has blazed with a
general steadfastness throughout geological time. It may have been cooling
slowly, but, speaking upon the scale of things astronomical, it has certainly
not cooled very much.
