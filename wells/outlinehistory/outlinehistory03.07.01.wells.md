# § 1
It is improbable that there was ever such a thing as a common human language.
We know nothing of the language of Palæolithic man; we do not even know whether
Palæolithic man talked freely.

We know that Palæolithic man had a keen sense of form and attitude, because of
his drawings; and it has been suggested that he communicated his ideas very
largely by gesture. Probably such words as the earlier men used were mainly
cries of alarm or passion or names for concrete things, and in many cases they
were probably imitative sounds made by or associated with the things named.[78]

The first languages were probably small collections of such words; they
consisted of interjections and nouns. Probably the nouns were said in different
intonations to convey different meanings. If Palæolithic man had a word for
“horse” or “bear,” he probably showed by tone or gesture whether he meant “bear
is coming,” “bear is going,” “bear is to be hunted,” “dead bear,” “bear has
been here,” “bear did this,” and so on. Only very slowly did the human mind
develop methods of indicating action and relationship in a formal manner.
Modern languages contain many thousands of words, but the earlier languages
could have consisted only of a few hundred. It is said that even modern
European peasants can get along with something less than a thousand words, and
it is quite conceivable that so late as the Early Neolithic Period that was the
limit of the available vocabulary. Probably men did not indulge in those days
in conversation or description. For narrative purposes they danced and acted
rather than told. They had no method of counting beyond a method of indicating
two by a dual number, and some way of expressing many. The growth of speech was
at first a very slow process indeed, and grammatical forms and the expression
of abstract ideas may have come very late in human history, perhaps only 400 or
500 generations ago.
