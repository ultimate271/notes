# § 5
History is and must always be no more than an account of beginnings. We can
venture to prophesy that the next chapters to be written will tell, though
perhaps with long interludes of set-back and disaster, of the final achievement
of world-wide political and social unity. But when that is attained, it will
mean no resting stage, nor even a breathing stage, before the development of a
new struggle and of new and vaster efforts. Men will unify only to intensify
the search for knowledge and power, and live as ever for new occasions. Animal
and vegetable life, the obscure processes of psychology, the intimate structure
of matter and the interior of our earth, will yield their secrets and endow
their conqueror. Life begins perpetually. Gathered together at last under the
leadership of man, the student-teacher of the universe, unified, disciplined,
armed with the secret powers of the atom and with knowledge as yet beyond
dreaming, Life, for ever dying to be born afresh, for ever young and eager,
will presently stand upon this earth as upon a footstool, and stretch out its
realm amidst the stars.
