# § 4
We may summarize the discussion of the last two chapters here by making a list
of the chief elements in this complicated accumulation of human beings which
made up the later Babylonian and Egyptian civilizations of from two thousand
five hundred to three thousand years ago. These elements grew up and became
distinct one from another in the great river valleys of the world in the course
of five or six thousand years. They developed mental dispositions and
traditions and attitudes of thought one to another. The civilization in which
we live to-day is simply carrying on and still further developing and working
out and rearranging these relationships. This is the world from which we
inherit. It is only by the attentive study of their origins that we can detach
ourselves from the prejudices and immediate ideas of the particular class to
which we may belong, and begin to understand the social and political questions
of our own time.

(1) First, then, came the priesthood, _the temple system_, which      was
the nucleus and the guiding intelligence about which the      primitive
civilizations grew. It was still in these later days a      great power in the
world, the chief repository of knowledge and      tradition, an influence over
the lives of every one, and a binding      force to hold the community
together. But it was no longer      all-powerful, because its nature made it
conservative and      inadaptable. It no longer monopolized knowledge nor
initiated fresh      ideas. Learning had already leaked out to other less
pledged and      controlled people, who thought for themselves. About the
temple      system were grouped its priests and priestesses, its scribes, its
physicians, its magicians, its lay brethren, treasurers, managers,
directors, and the like. It owned great properties and often      hoarded huge
treasures.

(2) Over against the priesthood, and originally arising out of it,
was the _court system_, headed by a king or a “king of kings,” who      was in
later Assyria and Babylonia a sort of captain and lay      controller of
affairs, and in Egypt a god-man, who had released      himself from the control
of his priests. About the monarch were      accumulated his scribes,
counsellors, record keepers, agents,      captains, and guards. Many of his
officials, particularly his      provincial officials, had great subordinate
establishments, and      were constantly tending to become independent. The
nobility of the      old river valley civilizations arose out of the court
system. It      was, therefore, a different thing in its origins from the
nobility      of the early Aryans, which was a republican nobility of elders
and      leading men.

(3) At the base of the social pyramid was the large and most
necessary class in the community, _the tillers of the soil_. Their      status
varied from age to age and in different lands; they were      free peasants
paying taxes, or serfs of the god, or serfs or      tenants of king or noble,
or of a private owner, paying him a rent;      in most cases tax or rent was
paid in produce. In the states of the      river valleys they were high
cultivators, cultivating comparatively      small holdings; they lived together
for safety in villages, and had      a common interest in maintaining their
irrigation channels and a      sense of community in their village life. The
cultivation of the      soil is an exacting occupation; the seasons and the
harvest sunsets      will not wait for men; children can be utilized at an
early age,      and so the cultivator class is generally a poorly educated,
close-toiling class, superstitious by reason of ignorance and the
uncertainty of the seasons, ill-informed and easily put upon. It is
capable at times of great passive resistance, but it has no purpose      in its
round but crops and crops, to keep out of debt and hoard      against bad
times. So it has remained to our own days over the      greater part of Europe
and Asia.

(4) Differing widely in origin and quality from the tillers of the
soil was _the artisan class_. At first, this was probably in part a
town-slave class, in part it consisted of peasants who had      specialized
upon a craft. But in developing an art and mystery of      its own, a technique
that had to be learnt before it could be      practised, each sort of craft
probably developed a certain      independence and a certain sense of community
of its own. The      artisans were able to get together and discuss their
affairs more      readily than the toilers on the land, and they were able to
form      guilds to restrict output, maintain rates of pay, and protect their
common interest.

(5) As the power of the Babylonian rulers spread out beyond the
original areas of good husbandry into grazing regions and less      fertile
districts, a class of _herdsmen_ came into existence. In      the case of
Babylonia these were nomadic Semites, the Bedouin, like      the Bedouin of
to-day. They probably grazed their flocks over great      areas much as the
sheep ranchers of California do.[151] They were      paid and esteemed much
more highly than the husbandmen.

(6) The first _merchants_ in the world were shipowners, like the
people of Tyre and Cnossos, or nomads who carried and traded goods      as they
wandered between one area of primitive civilization and      another. In the
Babylonian and Assyrian world the traders were      predominantly the Semitic
Arameans, the ancestors of the modern      Syrians. They became a distinct
factor in the life of the      community; they formed great households of their
own. Usury      developed largely in the last thousand years B.C. Traders
needed      accommodation; cultivators wished to anticipate their crops. Sayce
(_op. cit._) gives an account of the Babylonian banking-house of
Egibi, which lasted through several generations and outlived the      Chaldean
Empire.

(7) A class of _small retailers_, one must suppose, came into
existence with the complication of society during the later days of      the
first empires, but it was not probably of any great importance.      It is
difficult to understand how there could be much active      retailing without
small change, and there is little evidence of      small change to be found
either in Egypt or Mesopotamia.[152]      Shekels and half-shekels of silver,
weighing something between a      quarter and half an ounce, are the lightest
weights of stamped      metal of which we find mention.

(8) A growing class of _independent property owners_.

(9) As the amenities of life increased, there grew up in the court,
temples, and prosperous private houses a class of _domestic      servants_,
slaves or freed slaves, or young peasants taken into the      household.

(10) _Gang workers._--These were prisoners of war or debt slaves,      or
impressed or deported men.

(11) _Mercenary soldiers._--These also were often captives or
impressed men. Sometimes they were enlisted from friendly foreign
populations in which the military spirit still prevailed.

(12) _Seamen._

In modern political and economic discussions we are apt to talk rather glibly
of “labour.” Much has been made of the _solidarity of labour_ and its sense of
community. It is well to note that in these first civilizations, what we speak
of as “labour” is represented by five distinct classes dissimilar in origin,
traditions, and outlook--namely, classes 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, and the oar-tugging
part of 12. The “solidarity of labour” is, we shall find when we come to study
the mechanical revolution of the nineteenth century A.D., a new idea and a new
possibility in human affairs.
