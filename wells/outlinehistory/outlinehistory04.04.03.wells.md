# § 3
But, meanwhile, in Egypt and upon the Mediterranean coast another system of
writing grew up. Its beginnings are probably to be found in the priestly
picture-writing (hieroglyphics) of the Egyptians, which also in the usual way
became partly a sound-sign system. As we see it on the Egyptian monuments, the
hieroglyphic writing consists of decorative but stiff and elaborate forms, but
for such purpose as letter-writing and the keeping of recipes and the like, the
Egyptian priests used a much simplified and flowing form of these characters,
the _hieratic script_. Side by side with this hieratic script rose another,
probably also derivative from the hieroglyphs, a script now lost to us, which
was taken over by various non-Egyptian peoples in the Mediterranean, the
Phœnicians, Libyans, Lydians, Cretans, and Celt-Iberians, and used for business
purposes. Possibly a few letters were borrowed from the later cuneiform. In the
hands of these foreigners this writing was, so to speak, cut off from its
roots; it lost all but a few traces of its early pictorial character. It ceased
to be pictographic or ideographic; it became simply a pure sound-sign system,
an _alphabet_.

There were a number of such alphabets in the Mediterranean differing widely
from each other.[134] It may be noted that the Phœnician alphabet (and perhaps
others) omitted vowels. Possibly they pronounced their consonants very hard and
had rather indeterminate vowels, as is said to be still the case with tribes of
South Arabia. Quite probably, too, the Phœnicians used their alphabet at first
not so much for writing as for single initial letters in their business
accounts and tallies. One of these Mediterranean alphabets reached the Greeks,
long after the time of the Iliad, who presently set to work to make it express
the clear and beautiful sounds of their own highly developed Aryan speech. It
consisted at first of consonants, and the Greeks added the vowels. They began
to write for record, to help and fix their bardic tradition....
