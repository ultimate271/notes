# § 7
For some time Buddhism flourished in India. But Brahminism, with its many gods
and its endless variety of cults, always flourished by its side, and the
organization of the Brahmins grew more powerful, until at last they were able
to turn upon this caste-denying cult and oust it from India altogether. The
story of that struggle is not to be told here; there were persecutions and
reactions, but by the eleventh century, except for Orissa, Buddhist teaching
was extinct in India. Much of its gentleness and charity had, however, become
incorporated with Brahminism.

Over great areas of the world, as our map has shown, it still survives; and it
is quite possible that in contact with western science, and inspired by the
spirit of history, the original teaching of Gautama, revived and purified, may
yet play a large part in the direction of human destiny.

But with the loss of India the Aryan Way ceased to rule the lives of any Aryan
peoples. It is curious to note that while the one great Aryan religion is now
almost exclusively confined to Mongolian peoples, the Aryans themselves are
under the sway of two religions, Christianity and Islam, which are, as we shall
see, essentially Semitic. And both Buddhism and Christianity wear garments of
ritual and formula that seem to be derived through Hellenistic channels from
that land of temples and priestcraft, Egypt, and from the mentality of the
brown Hamitic peoples.
