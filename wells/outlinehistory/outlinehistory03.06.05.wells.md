# § 5
It may clear up the necessarily rather confused discussion of this chapter to
give a summary of the views expressed here in a diagram. This, on page 149,
should be compared later with the language diagram on page 155.

We have put the Australoids as a Negroid branch, but many authorities would set
back the Australoid stem closer to the Tasmanian, and there may even be sound
reasons for transferring both Australoids and Tasmanians as separate branches
to the left of the “Later Palæolithic Races.” To avoid crowding we have omitted
the Hairy Ainu. They may be the last vestiges of an ancient primitive
Pre-Nordic Pre-Mongolian strain from which the Nordic races are descended.
