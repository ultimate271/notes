In reading this chapter it is well to remember how laborious and difficult are
the tasks of comparative philology, and how necessary it is to understand the
qualifications and limitations that are to be put upon its conclusions. The
Aryan group of languages is much better understood than any other, for the
simple reason that it has been more familiar and accessible to European
science. The other groups have been less thoroughly investigated, because so
far they have not been studied exhaustively by men accustomed to use them, and
whose minds are set in the key of their structure. Even the Semitic languages
have been approached at a disadvantage because few Jews think in Hebrew. But a
time is fast approaching when Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, and Indian
philologists will come to the rescue in these matters, and good reason may be
found for revising much that has been said above about the native American,
Ural-Altaic, primitive Chinese, and Polynesian groups of tongues.
