# § 3
After this first glimpse of something at least sub-human in the record of
geology, there is not another fragment of human or man-like bone yet known from
that record for an interval of hundreds of thousands of years. It is not until
we reach deposits which are stated to be of the Second Interglacial period,
200,000 years later, 200,000 or 250,000 years ago, that another little scrap of
bone comes to hand. Then we find a jaw-bone.

This jaw-bone was found in a sandpit near Heidelberg, at a depth of eighty feet
from the surface,[26] and it is not the jaw-bone of a man as we understand man,
but it is man-like in every respect, except that it has absolutely no trace of
a chin; it is more massive than a man’s, and its narrowness behind could not,
it is thought, have given the tongue sufficient play for articulate speech. It
is not an ape’s jaw-bone; the teeth are human. The owner of this jaw-bone has
been variously named _Homo Heidelbergensis_ and _Palæoanthropus
Heidelbergensis_, according to the estimate formed of its humanity or
sub-humanity by various authorities. He lived in a world not remotely unlike
the world of the still earlier sub-man of the first implements; the deposits in
which it is found show that there were elephants, horses, rhinoceroses, bison,
a moose, and so forth with it in the world, but the sabre-toothed tiger was
declining and the lion was spreading over Europe. The implements of this period
(known as the Chellean period) are a very considerable advance upon those of
the Pliocene Age. They are well made but _very much bigger_ than any truly
human implements. The Heidelberg man may have had a very big body and large
forelimbs. He may have been a woolly strange-looking creature.
