A fifth region of language formation was south-eastern Asia, where there still
prevails a group of languages consisting of monosyllables without any
inflections, in which the tone used in uttering a word determines its meaning.
This may be called the Chinese or MONOSYLLABIC group, and it includes Chinese,
Burmese, Siamese, and Tibetan. The difference between any of these Chinese
tongues and the more western languages is profound. In the Pekinese form of
Chinese there are only about 420 primary monosyllables, and consequently each
of these has to do duty for a great number of things, and the different
meanings are indicated either by the context or by saying the word in a
distinctive tone. The relations of these words to each other are expressed by
quite different methods from the Aryan methods; Chinese grammar is a thing
different in nature from English grammar; it is a separate and different
invention. Many writers declare there is no Chinese grammar at all, and that is
true if we mean by grammar anything in the European sense of inflections and
concords. Consequently any such thing as a literal translation from Chinese
into English is an impossibility. The very method of the thought is
different.[84] Their philosophy remains still largely a sealed book to the
European on this account, and vice versa, because of the different nature of
the expressions.
