# § 2
One special development of the dinosaurian type of reptile was a light,
hopping, climbing group of creatures which developed a bat-like web between the
fifth finger and the side of the body, which was used in gliding from tree to
tree after the fashion of the flying squirrels. These bat-lizards were the
_Pterodactyls_. They are often described as _flying_ reptiles, and pictures are
drawn of Mesozoic scenery in which they are seen soaring and swooping about.
But their breastbone has no keel such as the breastbone of a bird has for the
attachment of muscles strong enough for long-sustained flying. They must have
flitted about like bats. They must have had a grotesque resemblance to heraldic
dragons, and they played the part of bat-like birds in the Mesozoic jungles.
But bird-like though they were, they were not birds nor the ancestors of birds.
The structure of their wings was altogether different from that of birds. The
structure of their wings was that of a hand with one long finger and a web; the
wing of a bird is like an arm with feathers projecting from its hind edge. And
these Pterodactyls had no feathers.
