# § 2
Certain very fundamental things there may have been in men’s minds long before
the coming of speech. Chief among these must have been fear of the Old Man of
the tribe. The young of the primitive squatting-place grew up under that fear.
Objects associated with him were probably forbidden. Every one was forbidden to
touch his spear or to sit in his place, just as to-day little boys must not
touch father’s pipe or sit in his chair. He was probably the master of all the
women. The youths of the little community had to remember that. The idea of
_something forbidden_, the idea of things being, as it is called, _tabu_, not
to be touched, not to be looked at, may thus have got well into the human mind
at a very early stage indeed. J. J. Atkinson, in an ingenious analysis of these
primitive tabus which are found among savage peoples all over the world, the
tabus that separate brother and sister, the tabus that make a man run and hide
from his stepmother, traces them to such a fundamental cause as this.[63] Only
by respecting this primal law could the young male hope to escape the Old Man’s
wrath. And the Old Man must have been an actor in many a primordial nightmare.
A disposition to propitiate him even after he was dead is quite understandable.
One was not sure that he _was_ dead. He might only be asleep or shamming. Long
after an Old Man was dead, when there was nothing to represent him but a mound
and a megalith, the women would convey to their children how awful and
wonderful he was. And being still a terror to his own little tribe, it was easy
to go on to hoping that he would be a terror to other and hostile people. In
his life he had fought for his tribe, even if he had bullied it. Why not when
he was dead? One sees that the Old Man idea was an idea very natural to the
primitive mind and capable of great development.[64]
