# § 3
It has been necessary to deal rather fully with the political structure of the
Roman republic because of its immense importance to this day. The constitution
of Carthage[236] need not detain us long.

Italy under Rome was a republican country; Carthage was that much older thing,
a republican city. She had an “empire,” as Athens had an “empire,” of tributary
states which did not love her, and she had a great and naturally disloyal
industrial slave population.

In the city there were two elected “kings,” as Aristotle calls them, the
_suffetes_, who were really equivalent to the Roman censors; their Semitic name
was the same as that used for the Jewish _judges_. There was an impotent public
assembly and a senate of leading personages; but two committees of this senate,
nominally elected, but elected by easily controlled methods, the Hundred and
Four and the Thirty, really constituted a close oligarchy of the richest and
most influential men. They told as little as they could to their allies and
fellow citizens, and consulted them as little as possible. They pursued schemes
in which the welfare of Carthage was no doubt subordinated to the advantage of
their own group. They were hostile to new men or novel measures, and confident
that a sea ascendancy that had lasted two centuries must be in the very nature
of things.
