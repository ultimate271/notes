# § 3
Far less prevalent at this time were certain other truly birdlike creatures, of
which the earlier sorts also hopped and clambered and the later sorts skimmed
and flew. These were at first--by all the standards of
classification--Reptiles. They developed into true birds as they developed
wings and as their reptilian scales became long and complicated, fronds rather
than scales, and so at last, by much spreading and splitting, feathers.
Feathers are the distinctive covering of birds, and they give a power of
resisting heat and cold far greater than that of any other integumentary
covering except perhaps the thickest fur. At a very early stage this novel
covering of feathers, this new heatproof contrivance that life had chanced
upon, enabled many species of birds to invade a province for which the
pterodactyl was ill equipped. They took to sea fishing--if indeed they did not
begin with it--and spread to the north and south polewards beyond the
temperature limits set to the true reptiles. The earliest birds seem to have
been carnivorous divers and water birds. To this day some of the most primitive
bird forms are found among the sea birds of the Arctic and Antarctic seas, and
it is among these sea birds that zoologists still find lingering traces of
teeth, which have otherwise vanished completely from the beak of the bird.

The earliest known bird (the _Archæopteryx_) had no beak; it had a row of teeth
in a jaw like a reptile’s. It had three claws at the forward corner of its
wing. Its tail too was peculiar. All modern birds have their tail feathers set
in a short compact bony rump; the _Archæopteryx_ had a long bony tail with a
row of feathers along each side.
