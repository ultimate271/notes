# § 2
We do not know yet the region in which the ancestors of the white and whitish
Neolithic peoples worked their way up from the Palæolithic stage of human
development. Probably it was somewhere about south-western Asia, or in some
region now submerged beneath the Mediterranean Sea or the Indian Ocean, that,
while the Neanderthal men still lived their hard lives in the bleak climate of
a glaciated Europe, the ancestors of the white men developed the rude arts of
_their_ Later Palæolithic period. But they do not seem to have developed the
artistic skill of their more northerly kindred, the European Later Palæolithic
races. And through the hundred centuries or so while Reindeer Men were living
under comparatively unprogressive conditions upon the steppes of France,
Germany, and Spain, these more-favoured and progressive people to the south
were mastering agriculture, learning to develop their appliances, taming the
dog, domesticating cattle, and, as the climate to the north mitigated and the
equatorial climate grew more tropical, spreading northward. All these early
chapters of our story have yet to be disinterred. They will probably be found
in Asia Minor, Persia, Arabia, India, or north Africa, or they lie beneath the
Mediterranean waters. Twelve thousand years ago, or thereabouts--we are still
too early for anything but the roughest chronology--Neolithic peoples were
scattered all over Europe, north Africa, and Asia. They were peoples at about
the level of many of the Polynesian islanders of the last century, and they
were the most advanced peoples in the world.
