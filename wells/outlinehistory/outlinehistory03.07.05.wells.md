Across to the north-east of the Aryan and Semitic areas there must once have
spread a further distinct language system which is now represented by a group
of languages known as the TURANIAN, or URAL-ALTAIC group. This included the
Lappish of Lapland and the Samoyed speech of Siberia, the Finnish language,
Magyar, Turkish or Tartar, Manchu and Mongol; it has not as a group been so
exhaustively studied by European philologists, and there is insufficient
evidence yet whether it does or does not include the Korean and Japanese
languages. (A Japanese writer, Mr. K. Hirai, has attempted to show that
Japanese and Aryan may have had a common parent tongue.[83])
