So today is a tuesday. I don't know what I want to write about, but I told
myself that I was going to write right now, and so that is what I am doing. I
do want to say, that typing on this logitech piece of shit is really starting
to wear on me, and I can't wait until my next mech comes in the mail. That will
be the day.

I might even, in antcipation of getting that new mech, just bring my current
one in to the office. I could use my Corsair in the mean time, and when my new
mech comes in, that one can be used for the house.

I think that would be better, because the new one will be the sort that I can
use for gaming, and the current one is nice because it has the function row
keys.

So with that out of the way, I want to talk about what it is that I wanted to
write about. I want to create something of a series, titled something to the
likes of "Things I've learned from Mathematics (and you should too)". Of
course, that is a cheesy Barnes and Noble exclusive kind of title, but it's
more or less what I think everyone should know about certain mathematical and
physics principles.

The first kinds of articles I have thought about writing are.

On numbers.
The Lorentz Transformation.
Evaluating functions for complex numbers.
Maclarin series and their analytic functions.
Trigonometric identities.

Of course, there are many, many, more things to write about here.

The next sort of article that I am working on is the "retold myths" articles. I
am currently working on a "dialogue of Seth and Cain" as a sort of entrance in
to this domain. Some more ideas for this section is.

Noah's ark
Samson
Jonah
Specific miricle of Jesus

And so on. Like the first option, you could see the limitless possiblities for
articles of this sort.

For the first kind of article, it will be nice, because I won't have to do
anything to make it polished. I think, the best thing to do, actually, would be
to learn latex, and write it that way. Regardless, the point is, these
articles won't have drafts. They will be more straight from the horses mouth,
so to speak. In fact, most of these sorts of articles will require more time in
preparation than in actual writing, and drafting will be next to non-existant.

On the other hand, the other sort of artcile, the retold myths article, will be
more challenging. I think partly because I am not as familiar with myths as I
am with math, but also because it will require more drafting, more raw
material, and a lot of introspection. It will be more difficult to get
everything out on the page, and unlike the first kind of article, this sort of
article will not neccesarily come easily, or correctly, the first time it is
written.

This kind of article has the advantage that I can just write whatever I want,
and it will at least have some merit, but the biggest thing when it comes to
writing this sort of article is to remember that it comes in increments, and
that you don't have to use everything you write.
