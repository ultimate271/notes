So last night I had a couple dreams.

The first one took place in Colorado.

The second one was something somewhat similar, but I don't remember it at the
moment.

The Colorado dream started in a sort of condo like place. It takes place on the
sort of highway intersection in my dreams that represents "not home"
intersections. There was a house there, and in the house was a guy that was
going to introduce me to his friend group. He asks me if I want to smoke some
weed, and I tell him that I'm not interested.

So we end up going to a bowling alley, but this is something like a role play
bowling alley? That's the best way I know how to describe it. Essentially, each
person in the group is to take a certain character, and on the side of the
alley, there will be a character that will appear, and when that character
appears, the person who cooresponds to that character will get up and act out
that character, or something like that. It was strange.

Anyway, this friend takes me to this group, and I get acquaninted with them.
That's honestly about all I remember about this dream.
