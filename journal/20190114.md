So last night I had a few dreams, and I remember some of them, but not all of
them, and particularly not all of the details.

So the first dream, I decide to go to church with Grant. We are there, and as
we are there, we are in the congregation, and everyone is all huddled together
singing something. I'm in between GRant, who is on the end, and someone else,
and I end up pulling Grant in to me. Afterward, Grant mentions that he didn't
expect me to pull him in so close.

When the service is over, I end up talking with someone else there. I forget
exactly what the thing was, but she had some sort of baby, but it wasn't a
standard baby, it was like some sort of lizard thing that she was treating like
a baby. I honestly don't remember much about it at all. We end up having a
conversation about it in the rafters where the organ is.

So the second dream is the most prominent of last night. It is basically a sort
of horror movie. So the premise is, our house is set on the bay (or ocean, or
some large body of water) and from my parents back yard, there is the water,
with a pier, and the pier extends out sideways across the shoreline for quite a
ways. All along this shoreline with our pier, our dad has captured some fish,
and he has genitcially mutated them based upon color to react to different ways
to electrical impulses, and by doing so, he will create patterns and such for
spectecle and awe.

So at the beginning of the dream, I remember going under the water, and I
actually watched from the bottom, as teh yellow fish, and the blue fish, and
other fish all arranged themselves quickly in different patterns to create
rather cool fish patterns.

I think it was from this first trip underwater, though, that something started
to go wrong, and the fish suddenly decided to get hyper aggressive, and began
to attack me. I started swimming off, and I started to get really heavy, and I
just barely got to the edge of the water where I was able to get out.

After I got out, I started to explain to my mom, and dad, what had happened,
but my dad didn't believe me. Kyle was there as well, and he wanted to check it
out from the shore, so he tethered himself to a rope, and started walking out.

My dad wanted to check it out, but I warned him that he shouldn't just jump in
and see, so I started to try and post a board on to the side of the pier that
would be used as the base of a tether.

Eventually, I forget exactly what happened, but my dad ended up just jumping in
to the water. When he went in, the fish started attacking him, and latching
themselves on to him, and he was able to swim out. WHen he got out, I was able
to scrape the fish off of him on our back porch. He then called Kyle over, and
said that the fish were becoming violent. I was a little annoyed at this point,
because that was exactly what I had said, but I was glad that we were taking
action now.

So at this point, I remember my dad coming up with a plan. He said that what he
was going to do was jump in the water, and let the fish attack him, and then
get out, and we can scrape them all off onto the land. I said that I didn't
like this plan too much, but I didn't have a better idea, and I wasn't actively
opposed to this plan, so I agreed to help in it.

Also, it's worth mentioning at this point that in the dream I am convinced that
this is the premise for a movie, and that this dream is all just a sort of
reenactment of that movie. I tried to think about how the movie ended, but I
didn't know, because I hadn't seen the movie all the way through, so I decided
that when I would wake up, I would watch the movie. This wasn't a lucid dream,
but it was sort of nearly so.

So my dad jump in again, and the fish begin to attack him. My dad is swimming
around the area where the fish are, but as he gets to a point, the fish begin
to overwhelm him, and he can't get out. I see that I need to help him, but I'm
apprehensive about getting bitten again by all of these fish. However, I looked
out, and a lot of the fish that would have bitten me were biting my dad, so I
decided to get in, and if I did get bitten, it would be minimal.

I get to my dad, and I try and boost him up on to the edge to help him out, but
he says, "No, you first, then I can get out." I tell him "No stupid, I came in
to the water to help you." In this confusion, he brings me under multiple
times, because I am trying to help him up, but he doesn't want to get out of
the water until I get out. Eventually, he gives in, and I boost him up out of
the water, and then I get out of the water. At this point, I scold him, and I
ask him, "What's the rule?" and he says "Always accept help when it's given"
and I said, "Okay, good, so we're on the same page now."

So now we are at a point where the fish are starting to mutate. They have
gotten stronger with the passes we have done to try and get them out of the
water. They are beginning to jump out of the water in attempts to attack us
while we are on land. Some of them have taken the form of Crocodile Jaws (just
the jaws and not the body), and they are quite large and strong.

So at this point, we are at a loss of what to do. I remember saying something
like, "They are mutating, and they will continue to get stronger as long as
they are in the water."

At this point, someone, I forget who, but he could be best described as a "good
ole boy," goes to the wall of our parents house, and he peels off a sort of
"ant killer" tab, which was covering up an ant hole, and out of it comes a
bunch of ants. I remember thinking, "Why the fuck would he do that?" He then
says, "It's time we did this to them," refering to the tab.

Someone else there, who could be best reffered to as a good ole girl, then
says, "It's time you hit them with the tide bleach. That will kill them for
sure." I remember saying, "Oh, no no no, that's a really bad idea, it will only
make them mutate faster. But I remember that no matter how much I told them
that it felt like a bad idea, they were convinced that it was the only way to
stop them from mutating further. It was around this point that I woke up.

The last dream took place with my grandparents. They decided that they wanted
to play a game. They were to give me a phrase or something similar, and then I
would have a dream about something, and then after the game I would recall my
dreams, and they would compare them to the phrase, and see how well it matched.

I agreed to this, and proceeded to have something like seven dream fragments. I
don't remember them now, but in the dream I did.

So after I had all of these fragments, I started to explain them, and we had a
humorous time comparing all of the fragments to the words that they were
supposed to match with. My grandparents thought the whole thing was humorous.
