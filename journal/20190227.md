So last night I did some active imagination work. It's hard to say exactly what
came out of it, but I feel as though I made some good progress towards
understanding my psyche.

Something I want to say is, I think meditating should be focused on achieving
tasks such as "imagine yourself as a stomach looking up at your eyes" as many
times as you can in the time. I like this approach for two reasons.

The first is that I can see a clear coorelation between being able to do
something like this as you wish, and being able to flex your brain muscles in a
certain way on demand. It reminds me of mental squats in a sense. Sure, the
exact motion of the squat is something you will never be demanded of, but it
has the utility to apply to many kinds of strength based movements.

So that being said, I tried it for some time, and I would say I was fairly
successful in attempting to maintain that state of awareness of where "I" was.
I was definitely pretty honest with myself about when I was tricking myself
into thinking that I was in that state, and when I recognized that my mind was
playing tricks on me, I recovered as gracefully as I could.

The second thing I like about this kind of meditation is that it's usually
pretty sharp and clear when you are doing it right. If you are doing it right,
you will actually feel like a stomach looking up at a head, but when you are
not doing it right, you will be able to, with an elementary level of focus, be
aware of that, and resume on the task of attempting to go back to the state of
awareness.

The last thing that I want to say about this sort of meditation that I like
about it is that it requires you to backtrace your thought processes. In other
words, when you enter in to the meditative state of feeling like a being inside
of a stomach that is looking out of the eyes as if through a periscope, and you
are able to maintain that way of thinking genuinely for six or more seconds,
and then you "fall out" of that way of thought, you then have to go back and
ask yourself what thought process led to you falling out of the train of
thought, and that requires you to trace back on thoughts that you maybe
originally had no idea were happening.

As another thing that I like about this style of meditation is that it's
clearly exhausting, and not for the reason that Vissassipana is exhausting.
Vissassipana is exhausting because thinking about the breathe is super boring,
and so the brain generates all sorts of aches and pains associated with your
sitting position and brings up anxieties of things that you haven't dealt with
in order to try and "snap you out of it" in some sense. So vissassipana is
exhausting in the sense that you are constanly fighting off the urge to just
sit up and walk away from the chair.

This sort of meditation is exhausting for a different reason. It's exhausting
because conjuring your brain to see itself in a certain way is mentally tiring.
If Vissassipana is running, then this style of meditation would be more akin to
lifting. Actually, it would be more like bodyweight lifting. Being asked to do
100 pullups is exhausting in a way that running a mile is not, and vice versa.
They are both exhausting, but in different ways.

It's interesting how I just made this analogy as well. It seems to me that,
when I run, I am thinking for the most point about things like my posture, my
stride, my breath, and so forth. I'm thinking about these things in a way to
allow myself to ensure that I am getting the most full and deep breaths that I
can, and also to ensure that I am running in a way that won't hurt me the next
morning.

The sort of "meditative trance" that I go in to when running is much like a
vissassipana session.

When doing pullups, on the other hand, I do still think about the breath, but
more so I am thinking about imagining my "essence" or "being" as being
something that is outside of space, and this "being" is able to "bend" space
in certain way so that my muscles will flex and contract in a specific manner.
So in that, the meditative trance that I fall in to when doing pullups is
similar to the meditattive trance that I fall in to when doing this second
style of meditation.

So with that all being said, I don't know if there is much more to say on that
front.
