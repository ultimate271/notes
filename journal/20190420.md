So right now I am here, and I am writing in a piece of paper. There are many
things that I could write about, but the one that I am going to actually write
about is first talking about my typing ability.

So my typing is getting pretty good, from what I can tell. It's to the point
where I am able to type out something like seventy words per minute on a
consistent basis, and those words that come out are generally pretty accurate
and pretty cohesive. Occasionally something comes out that isn't quite exactly
what I want it to be, but that's okay.

Something else I want to say is that, reading something like Sanderson, it's
interesting to me that something like that can exist. That is, the life of a
man like Sanderson is literally sitting in room, and coming up with these
fantasy worlds that he then morphes into a novel that he then publishs and
releases and gets put on the shelves, and then everone reads it.

So yeah.

Something, also, tahtI want to say, as long as we are freewriting like this, is
that I had a very strange conversation with my brothers last night. Evan seems
cool but Kyle, I don't know man, I'm worried about him.

Like, I don't think I have to say much more than that. I think he is on a poor
state of mind. He could do greatly with a mushroom trip or something, but he
hasn't taken one and has this ridiculous stance on it all.

It's the tragedy of Christianity, I think.

So enough of that.
