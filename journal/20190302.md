So right now I want to try something a little bit new. I am typing with my
keyboard in my lap. It is an interesting experience. I would venture to guess
that this is not an ideal typing set up. Not at all. In fact, I would say it's
one of the inferior methods. I feel as though I am getting carpal tunnel
syndrome just by typing with my fingers like this in this way.

By the way, something feel wrong about the way my wrists sit. I just put some
things under my wrists, and I'm not sure if that feels better or worse. I just
elevated my keyboard, and this is most definitely worse.

I just put the keyboard further back and I can say for sure this is better.
