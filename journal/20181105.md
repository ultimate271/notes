So I just want to take this time to talk about how much of a piece of garbage I
can be some times.

Last weekend, I staying in my room the entire time. I checked my phone maybe
four times to make sure that no one was interested in me for any reason, and
besides that I rummaged through about a dozen different video games, not really
landing on one that I wanted to play at all, and cycling through the various
games wondering why they weren't satiating me. I didn't feel like playing
games, and I didn't feel like going out and doing things, so instead of either
of those things I scraped random youtube videos and masterbated around four or
five times throughout the weekend. Towards the end of the weekend, I ate some
beef, but I still felt hungry, and I didn't want more beef, so I went to the
grocery store, bought some donuts, and ate those with some milk. I did not work
out a single time, and that was the only time I actually went outside my
apartment. I had not other human contact besides what you would consider my
contact with others through twitch and youtube, which is wholly oneway and
non-recipricol.

So the question then is, if you're so disgusted with yourself, why don't you
change it, and the thing is, I don't really know. The answer I think is that
the critical mass for something to change hasn't been reached yet in a way. Or
rather, it's not the critical mass, but the incentives to change. I feel like I
have lost my ability to connect with others. I am disgusted with myself, and
that has become something of my identity, and with that as your identity, it
becomes difficult to connect with others over something like that. Not only do
they not care, but I also don't want them to care. It doesn't make for good
conversation.

In fact, it doesn't make for good journal entries either. I'm not sure why I am
writing this to be totally honest. I know that this sort of thing is
self-indulgent, and I really don't want to do that. It becomes a lot better
when I'm at work, which I am now. At least when I'm here, I have some
motivation to be a better person.

Something also, I think, to recognize, is that I have experimented with this
new diet, with both intermittent fasting and carnivore, and perhaps it has gone
on too long. Literally all I have been eating has been beef, almond butter and
strawberry preserves with milk, nuts during work, and now, in the past couple
of weeks, donuts. I should surely find something that seems reasonable to eat.

I also need to really clean my apartment. It's becoming ridiculous.
