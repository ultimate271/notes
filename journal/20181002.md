Last night, I had a dream. I was in my room, in my parents, playing video
games. I don't know what game I was playing. I was doing it to pay punishment
for my thing. My dad comes in, and asks me why I'm playing. I tell him it's
because it's the only path of punishment that I thought I could take. He tells
me that there is another, and that we will go out and sort this out. Me, him,
my mom, and Kyle and Evan, all get into the suburban, and are going to the
courthouse to retune my punishment. He get's distracted by some of his friends,
though, on the way. They start to talk about hobbies and things. That's all I
remember.
