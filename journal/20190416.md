So I have read now the first two chapters of Elantris. The prologue introduced
Elantris, then the first proper chapter introduced Prince Raoden, and his
transformation into a Shaod, and the second chapter introdcued his now
"widowed" fionce (I forget her name, something like Celeste, it's actually
Sarene). The third chapter introduces some more characters, and I'm not sure
exactly what those characters are supposed to fit in the whole story. I will
re-read that section at some point. But right now is not reading practice,
right now is writing practice.

So let's see, what is there that I want to write about.

Firstly, the reason I can justify my writing right now is becasue I am waiting
for the structure update to finish on some data that I am waiting for. I know,
if I wait long enough, the structure update will surely finish, but for the
time being, I am simply waiting here, waiting for the thing to do whatever it
needs to do.

Right as I type that, the structure update starts moving again. It looked, for
a moment, as if it were frozen, but now it is going through fields and such
again, and it is doing so at a decent pace, so I presume that it is working
properly again.

I need to do some testing today. It is still in the morning, so if I could get
at least one case done before I do anything. It shouldn't take me a long time
to do these things, it's just a matter of opening up word, and then following
all of the steps that need to be taken in order to get there. So let's chill
out for a moment.

Now that the structure update is finished, we can go and check what's going on
with the program. I'm going to dive in. I will return when I feel it is
appropiate.
