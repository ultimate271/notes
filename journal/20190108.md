So last night I had two dreams.

The first dream took place in a sort of alternate first person view of sc2. I
took the point of view of a probe, and I was recieving coaching from PiG. I do
want to note that I did not have him up on youtube or anything, it was silent
in the room when I had this dream.

So I remember being up on the main base, and walking down near the choke point.
PiG then instructed me to build a pylon, and when one didn't come out
immediately, he said, "What are you waiting for." At this point I said that I
was having trouble navigating the hotkeys, and he said, "Oh, you should just
practice building pylons really fast, look at me do it" And he started
selecting probes, and building pylons immeditely after selecting them.

At some point, he said, "You just need to expose yourself to having
conversation." Which is a weird thing to say, but it makes sense if you think
of my difficulty and anxiety with sc2 as related to my difficulty in
maintaining conversations that I find uninteresting.

Related to this dream, I think happening before it, I got a new keyboard. I
felt the keys, and they felt nice. I noticed this was a super small 40% layout,
but the layout wasn't quite dvorak. I started to take off the keycaps to mix it
around to the proper dvorak layout, but as I started doing that, it began
getting all mixed up, so eventually I decided to just take all of the keycaps
off, and rearrange them. That was the extent of that part of th edream.

So the other dream was actually a lucid dream. I wish I could remember how it
came about, because it wasn't entirely a seamless transition from waking to
dreaming, but I do remember that I felt the sleep paralysis, and I chose to let
myself feel paralyzed instead of moving with it. It feels really good, by the
way, if it were a drug I would totally take it. I mean, not really, but you get
the point.

Anyway, the dream materialized as a wal-mart store. But this store was more
like a giant box, with rows of shelves. I remember walking in to the store, and
there was a man there, and there was a center area that led to, I forget what
the name of the sign was, but on the right there was mens clothing, and on the
left there was womens.

One of the coolest things about this dream was, when I walked in, and I saw the
back of the store, I thought to myself, "Surely it's a bit longer than that"
and when I thought that, the store became longer. As in, I felt as though it
should be longer, and when I felt that, it became longer.

I understood that I was dreaming the whole time, and I began to walk around
looking for someone to talk to. At first, I wasn't sure what I was going to ask
them, but I just thought that I would talk to anyone, and ask them if they
could help me find something in the store.

So first I turned around and tryed to talk to the first man I could see, but he
ignored me and continued on his way. I then thought, "I know, I should talk to
an associate, that would make more sense. So I began to look around for someone
who worked there. At first, I couldn't find anyone, but eventually I found an
old man talking with a customer, and so I walked over, and I said, "Excuse me,
I was wondering if you could help me." But both of them turned kept their backs
turned to me, and gave me an "Eat Shit" sort of look, and walked away.

At this point, I wasn't sure what to do, and the dream started to vanish. I
wanted to try and keep it, but I could feel myself returning to my room, and at
this point I lost it completely.

I'm not sure how far on this endeavor I will be able to take it, once I start
smoking weed again. We will see.
