So this is something that I like to do occasionally, I just write for as long
as I would like to write and I don't stop. I'm not even reading what it is that
I am writing, I am just closing my eyes and writing into the machine. It's
totoally possible that I am writting into the machine in something that doesn't
make any sense as a sencence, but I think that this is okay, because it allaws
me to get into a sort of warm up  for being able to write as much as I would
like to write. I want my consciousness to sort of just flow out of the fingers
and onto the keyboard / other thing the machine the computer, and I just want
it all to come uout naturally without any dinterurpputiong from the thoughts of
correcting or altering what I have to say because it is incororrector or
anything like that. I mostly just want to be able to get to a speed where I am
writing words and I don't have have yidaea whan sort of correctness there is to
them, they are just waords and they come out and I have nothing to do with teh
speed or teh accuratcy wwhith which the come out of the fingers. It's really
quite freeing to thingk that I don't have tocrorrect shit wwhen I write in the
way, I can just wriete out oeverything that comevs into my head, and it just
comes out in a sort of quasi correct and quisi readable form, and no one knowns
the difference so that is finun.

I have been bplaying some traccraft 2, and it's incteresting, because I have
gootten to the point where wI feel I am gains ing some of the fundamentals of
rthe game. Howewver, I am noti netrestied in the game for the reason that I
really hate the chooesees, aond edfenidng cheesis in the game is not a fund
thingk. IIt would b elike in chess, if the trikey four move checkmate where a
common and even recommended startegey, I appericeaate that something like that
is in the cgame of chosee, but it's not what jchess ins about , and it
shouldn't be what starcraft is about. I do want to say thought thtat I think it
is possible to get to gM in sc2 by plaiying an honset game, it's just that,
well, it seems like by playing an honest game, you really have to play against
people who insist on doing all of these crazy shit, and when that happpens, it
becmoes a different game. I do want to say that there is something that is
quite cool about playing the game without the urge to chees or do anything like
that , itas something about sometihng and I don't know where my thoughts are
going now, it's really something and there is noise here where I d'nte have
thougts. Bacsiclally what I am saying is that something is somtehing and thotat
there is something else in the something else, and I don't really want to talk
too much about scracreaft,. Something that gets' ms me is that I have to toake
a break after I win a game of stracreft, I think with weed that wouldn't be an
issue, but when I win some sc2, espceicially musmlitpyle games in a row, I have
this strong inclinatino to stop, an. It's stressful, I think, is part of it,
and really its' ssomething. But plpaing a bamcro style is so good. I love
having sixiteen gateways, wihth three robobs and some starports and when a big
fight haoppens, even if it is a bad fight, my micro and lack there of can be
maede up for in the fact that i can remake my entire army and ahve some more
units ready to go, and these new units will be able to break whatever it is
that the opponinent sis doing , so it's not an usisue to have this som much
thstuff going on. It's lreally a good way to play. The problem is whin I get
all ined , it's a huge deal, and I don't know what to do with it. I don'nt know
haw to handle it. Everytime I get all ined, I die, even if I think I know what
I am doing. I need to get better at throwing bateries I think, and placing
fefense in the way. But if I expamnd fanst, as I do, then getting all inned is
a struggle at protecting the natural.

I like playing against zerg, because the early ling pressure can be stopped by
placing buildings at teh ramp of th enatural, and when that happens, you place
a unit ther iwih hold psosition, and they can't get past the thing taht you are
doing, so then it can go into a late game rather organically, and zergs always
go into late game, and when I have more units them tthem I wusulally win. There
was on egome a I played wehre osmeeone with mutas and a roach army was able to
attack in multilpele places, and I wasn't able to dfefned and it was quite
awful, but that guy I think was dimaned level, and I had the problem that I
didn't place enough statci d at the rogight point, and he even quit after he
did this stuff, and I wan tohat game, even though I dshouldn't have, but that
was a gacase where I think that the poerson was actually a pretty good playier
and his bmarcor game was on point and he knowe what eh was doing so I was not
aboule to fight him aor anything there.

I am done typing like this, it is awful, and I like to take breaks and stuff
when I write, this is really a dumb exercise and I want to stop, but I can',t,
it's rally quite bettern when someon e in my head want's to say something, but
just doing it to do it I think is not what I want to do.
