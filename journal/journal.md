# Unknown date that I will probably delete at some point (I was really high)
So this  is a story all about how my life got twist turned upside down and I'd
like to take a minute just sit right there I'll tell youa all about how I
became the fresh prince of bel air.

So for real though, what I want to be able to do is take my stream of
conscousness and transmit it directly onto this machine. That way, I can do
things like write blogs and journal articles and diary entries and all sorts of
stuff. and not have to thkni about what is going on beneath my fingers. So
yeah, when I g et to that point, it will be a good day, I can feel as though I
am getting close to that point, but it is really just a meter of time before I
totally get there. It's difficult to do, and it takkes a lot of practice. I lke
doing it though, it's just a matter of doing so in a way where I stay
comfortable.. I will say, I do not lke the way this keyboard I am uisng is so
slanted to the left. I want to get a 69% keyboard at some point, but I haven't
done my research on twhere to find them and how much they cost and cet etc. .

Regardless, there are a few things I want to say, The first thing is that I
think Ros Namajunes is one of the most gorgeous individuals I have ever met.
Like, absolutely stunning individual. It's absurd really. And I mean that in
the least sexual way possible. In fact, I would go so far te say that my
thoughts about rose are such that I would remove any feeling of sex about her
because that really obscures the kind of human being she is. She is so beautful
in so many ways, it's quite amazing to be honest.

To start, she is an amazing fighter. She cut her hair for practicality reasons,
she doesn't wear heels because it doesn't make sense for her to, she wears
loose pants and comfortable shooes.Everything about her is absolutely spot on.
She has the most genuine heart, the strongest soul of any individual I have
seen, and speaks with the most sincerity for herself and the poule around her
and the human race as a whole. I am absolutely blown away by her heart and her
soul, and her mind, and her body. Everything about this human being is
stunning. 

That only scatches the surface too. She eembodies everything that is good in
the world, and her charcter is what everyone should be actively seeking every
day to what she seekxs. It's in that constant search for the best version of
ourselves that we find the best version of ourselves. But only for glimpses.
The window into the soul is always dynamic, and one should always understand
how that window lies in with reality.



# 20180627 Intro to the journal - Brothers Karamazov leading to a visit with my father

So I am getting to a point in my life where I feel like my life is becoming a
really interesting story, a story that will be worth telling in perhaps
autobiographical format at some point. However, and this is a difficulty that I
have had in the past with my tale of Delita, and that is my memory of things is
not quite clear on certain details of the story that can sometimes be very
relevent to how things play out. And even if my memory is totally correct, the
act of actively trying to conjure up memories of things that happened even just
two years in the past is proving to be difficult, and one can only imagine that
conjuring up memories like this is sure to have so hindsight 20 20 glasses
going on, so this is my attempt to acheive a few things.

One, I want to write more. I have just gotten to the point where I can think
words in dvorak and they come out onto my fingers in pretty quick pace, so I
want to harness that and really make my typing ability become ingrained into my
subconscious so that I can really reap the benefits of switching keyboard
layouts. On top of that, I want to get used to the idea of writing down things
that might seem very long or very perhaps even cumbersome, but when read back
don't take very long to read. That is something I have noticed is that, when I
write, I write in very consice thoughts, and I'm afriad to venture to far on
tangents because when you write a tangent, it seems like you are on that
tangent for a very long time because writing take a very long time to do in
comparison to thinking or reading, but when you read it back it feels
disjointed because I don't stay on those tangents for very long, and the reader
is left to wonder why the writer is constanly cutting all of his tangents
short. It makes it seem as though I want to say something but that I am
constantly going back to the thing I stemmed from, which, like I said, creates
very disjointed and disorienting writing.

The second, is that I want to remember these things, my feelings, emotions,
thoughts, and etc, as they are still fresh in my memory. This journal is not
intended as a thereputic tool (although, surely it can be used as such in
certain times, and any journal and writing in general is always in a way
thereputic) but instead as a reflective one, a tool I can use to create a sort
of imprint of my emotions, of my actions, and of the events that happen to me
and those around me. I want this to be a sort of picture, a video of my life,
but this is better than a video because the reader consuming this medium has
access to the inner thoughts and emotions that go on inside of my head, where
as a consumer of video would have to infer that from the video being watched.
In a way, it is worse because the truth can be distorted through the lens of my
writing, but I will do my best to keep this metaphorical mirror as flat and
clean as possible, perhaps even making note of the places where the mirror may
be smudged or distorted so that the reader will know when something that is
being written is my perception of the truth rather than the raw unfiltered
facts of what happened.

So all of that out of the way, this first article will be a bit of a doozy, and
will be uncharacteristic of what I want this to be. What I want this to be is
my thoughts and emotions of the events of the day before, written in the
morning of the following day, in a way that puts the context of the day before
into my philosophical musings of this current day. However, I feel it neccesary
to start today with a whole background of what has happened to me over the past
8 months, since the day I got that phone call from my mother that my father was
diagonosed with Luekemia. But then that goes against the spirit of what I just
said, as if I went over that past 8 months, I would be conjuring up feelings
and emotions over those 8 months rather than reflecting on my current thoughts
and feelings of what is going on right now, so I am left in a bit of a quandry.
I think the best way to resolve this is to simply start at the start where I am
right now, and to go over the background of other things in my life before this
journal was started as they seem appropiate. So let's do that.

So I am currently section 2 part 1 chapter 1 of "The Brothers Karamazov".
Currently I have two translations of that novel by, one being the etext version
that I make annotiations in, translated by Constance Garrett, and the other is
the "everyman edition" or some such, that I bought at the store some weeks ago,
and is another translation by two individuals who I forget their names at the
moment. I have also just recently, this past weekend (so 4 days ago now) bought
a tablet to read on, and I have been reading on this tablet for the past few
days now, and I am liking that method quite a lot.

All of that preface to say, the themes and motivations of those characters, and
the events that happen to them, greatly remind me a lot of the various aspects
of myself. I read (I think on reddit somewhere) that when Dicken's and
Dostoeyevsky met (or maybe they didn't meet, and Dos. was simply commenting on
Dicken's words) Dickens said that he feels that he has two people inside of
him, always at opposition to eachother, and that each of these two people
together makes up the whole of who he is as a person, to which Dos. replied
"only two?" Indeed, I feel quite the same way as the Russian in this respect,
and I can see this sort of notion in a very crystal clear sort of way expressed
in the Brothers K. I very much have inside myself an Aloysha, but I also have
inside of me a Dmitri, and as much as I don't want it to be the case (and I
think most everyone would agree on this point) I have a bit of Fyodor in me as
well.

And to get to the point I am really trying to make, in the story right now,
the action is rising, Mitya has stomped the head in of his father, and Aloysha
is acting as a mediator between all of the crucial characters of the novel
(which creates a very cool dynamic of the story) and at the end of the day, as
Aloysha goes back to the monestary to rest for the night, he learns that Father
Zossima, his mentor and perhaps his true father figure in the story (if you
insist on analyzing it as such), is in poor health and will indeed come to his
death in the very near future. Aloysha, knowing this, talks about how he feels
his place is in the monestary, with the father, and that all other wordly
responsibities don't matter in comparison to the illness of this Zossima.

This feeling is much similar to the feeling I feel right now. Currently, two
days ago, my little brother Evan has finished his donation of stem cells, and
the process of transplanting the cells into my father (excuse my crudeness in
terms here, there is surely a much more elegent and scientific way of saying
this) has just begun. My father was admitted into UTSouthwestern a week ago,
where he was administered chemeo in some amount throughout the week in
preperation of this transfusion. This is a sort of end cap on the entire
process that has gone on for the past 8 months, my father having had 8
treatment of chemeo in that, along with regular appointments, spinal taps, and
other things which I feel guilty not knowing the full details of. And it is at
this end cap that I have this feeling that my place is with my father. I have
this feeling for two reasons, one being scarier than the other. The first
reason is because I feel that this process is difficult, and that as much
support as my father can get can only help, and that it is my responibility to
give him that support. The second, scarier reason, is that my father may die in
this process, and if he does, that means that there are things about our
relationship that I can never right. That is the scarier thing.

And that is where I come at this weird conflicting feelings. Obviously, the
death of my father is a scary thing, and any reasonable sane person when asked
if they would be okay with the event of the death of a their father would
obviously say they would rather their father not die, and that they would
prefer if he would keep on living. However, my emotions in this instance are
different, and are something I have been struggling with pretty much ever since
he was diagonsed. You see, what worries me more about his death is not the
actual grief of his death itself (although for sure I know I will experience at
least some grief, even if it is fleeting and not at all like what I imagine it
might feel like) but instead the anguish at having his death come to a point
where I feel our relationship is on a cliffhanger. My father and I have had a
very strange relationship over the past few years, not even talking about my
childhood, which I'm sure a hypnotist could find some buried thoughts and
memories and emotions of things that I have tucked away in there, but just in
the past few years we have been in a weirld place that is hard to describe. I
still have moments where I have lingering hatred (perhaps hatred is too strong
a word) resentment, bitterness, and overall distaste for him. I have moments
where I think to who he is, how I was raised (by both him and my mother), and
how we interact, and I have displeasure in our relationship, and these moments
where in the past have been simply me being dissatissfied with the relationship
and nothing more, now are associated with moments of guilt as I have these
thoughts, these thoughts of a man who is fighting against a terrible disease, a
man who is fighting it as he fights everything else in his life, and needs my
support and my love.

And the truly conflicting thing is, these thoughts have even gone so far as to
give me a sense of "well fuck him anyway". This is the truely disconcerting
thing. I have had thoughts that, well maybe he doesn't get past it, and that's
where the story of my relationship with my father ends, and maybe I'm okay with
that. I have never gone so far as to entertain the idea that "well maybe he
does deserve it" as certainly, though I do have these qualms about my father, I
don't believe that any human no matter how vile ever "deserves" anything, and
even if the concept of one human deserving something were a reasonable one, my
father would certainly not be one who would deserve the treatment he has
received by this disease in the least. Indeed, let it be known, though I have
my troubles and my issues with my fathers actions towards me and our
relationship, and I have my issues with his ideaology, and how he lives his
life and the choices he has made through it, I know that truely deep down he is
not a bad man, and quite on the contrary I know that he has a very strong sense
of selfless giving towards his family, which includes me his son of course, and
I don't want to say that I know he loves us, because the word love doesn't mean
much of anything without context, but I know that his sense of giving towards
family is strong, perhaps the strongest thing that he feels. Of course I am
only speculating, but this is something inside of me that I know to be true,
and I can only know it to be true in having this relationship of father and
son.

However, I still have these reservations, these feelings of anomosity towards
him, lingering from my own actions and our relationship as it evolved over the
past six or so years through my time in college and afterward. Of course, I
know these thoughts are simply thoughts I cannot help in myself, and that all of
my thoughts are the consequences of my upbringing, my life, and of the universe
that provides and generates all things.

Still, the point in all of this is that there is still a discord in the
relationship between me and my father. In fact I have talked with my mother
more than with my father about this relationship, and this is only something
that can't be talked about, but will only come in time. But now that the
possibility of time is limited, now that it's unsure whether time will persist
past this transplant, this is where my feelings come from, and this is where it
comes back full cicle to the protagonist Aloysha, who feels he should be with
his Father Zossima in his last days and with nothing else. I feel my place now
is visiting my father, I need to see him, to be with him. Is it selfish? Do I
want this simply so that I don't have to live with the idea that if he does
die, I will be able to tell myself I did all I could to get things in a less
disconcordant way than I would otherwise? I don't think it is selfish. Seattle
Brett might have treated this moment selfishly (and I do still hold that
everything we do as human beings in done selfishly in a certian sense) but now
I know it in myself that my feelings of needing to be with my father come from
something else, something apart from me. Of course, it is not apart from me,
but it comes from my meditation of this world, the observance of my thoughts,
not from trying to control my thoughts. It is this observer, who observes this
feeling, this feeling of needing to be with my father. I know intellectually
the selfish reasons for wanting to visit him more, which is why the thoughts
could appear in the first place, but the thoughts and feelings appeared quite
on their own, without the guidance of the ego and it is simply the observance
of them that I am feeling now.

I made a visit this past sunday, four days ago, and I actually visited twice
with a session of Bikram Yoga sandwiched in between. I want to make time to
visit him, but there are so many other things I want to pursue in my life right
now that it makes finding time for it difficult. However, this feeling is
strong, and I am glad, as my heart has been eased on one point having visited
him. When I visited, the nurse there had to administer a Lovanox shot to him,
which he had to do for me after my incident at the hospital, and that got us to
talking about my experince. Something I've said a few times, is that in a way
it's much easier to be on that side than it is to be on this side, and I hold
to that, although for me I was only on that side for a few days, where as he is
on that side, and has been for over eight months now, but we got to talking
about that again, and my dad can agree to an extent. I then mentioned something
which I have said before I know to my mom, and maybe to my dad as well, I don't
remember, but I said it during my visit this past Sunday, that I wish I would
have told them at the time of my incident, but I knew I was going to be okay.
And the way I put it was, "I don't if it was foolishness, or false knowledge, or
where that knowledge came from, but I knew that my numbness was temporary,
that it didn't feel permanent, and that I knew I would get back the use of my
left arm, and that I wish I would have told my parents that, because it seemed
so obvious to me that it was temporary, and I didn't know that they were so
worried about that." And to that, my father replied, that he knows too that he
will get through this transfusion as well. And the way he put it, he put in a
way that I know was not false, he spoke candidly, in reply to my words of
course, but that, in spite of the percentages and prognosises that people give
of him, he knows that he will survive through this. It's true, it's genuine, or
at least, it's as true and genuine as I know it can be being on this side of
the disease and not that one, and the doubts I have been having that perhaps he
might not make it through this (for indeed I have had doubts that I haven't
talked about in this article, but they are there), doubts which I have known
and I wish to false, those doubts I can at least supress in good conscious.
Yes, I felt guilty supressing those doubts before the visit, for fear that I
was not supressing doubts, but instead supressing a realist attitude towards
this situation, but now I know that they are true, honest to god doubts that I
feel, and I can supress them honestly, knowing they are doubts and not thoughts
of acceptance. Acceptance is important, but now is not the time for that, and
these thoughts are not thoughts of acceptance. And so I will visit, and so I
will rejoice in my life, in my feelings of "being there" (oh there must be a
better word for that), and I will rejoice in the lives that we share together.
I will continue to visit, without expectation, because that is what I feel I
need to do, not to gain anything for myself or for my father, or for anyone
else, but because I simply feel that my place is with my father.

# 20180628 Dreams: Arguing with Kyle about Russian letters - Blessing of the Cells

So this is the beginning of my second dedicated journal article. There are a
few things that I want to go over, and I'm not sure which to start with. The
first is a dream I had, that had me waking up a little disturbed, and the
second is I already forgot what it is. Oh, right, it has to do with a text I
got from my mom. Let's start with the dream.

Okay, so today I had a most peculiar dream. Fortunately, this one did not
involve marijuana in any way (the last dream I had was a couple nights ago, and
very much had to do with marijuana, but I that one, though it might be worth
writing down, was not near as interesting phycologically as this one). The
dream started (or at least the first thing I remember about the dream) in the
parking lot of a park. This park was similar to a park I remember visiting as a
kid where we had a sort of PE session once. The parking lot was on let's say
the south end of the park (this detail is not relevent, and I am only using
south to give indications of direction) and has a sort of open field from this
lot. I am referring to strictly the dream park by the way, and I don't think
this childhood PE experience has anything to do with the dream. Anyway, from
that parking lot, it opens into a sort of open field, but it's not really fully
open as there were paths and trees and stuff, so the field wasn't open enough
to play any sort of sport on, but there was a grassy part. Across this grassy
part, parallel to the parking lot, there was a path that goes across, and
across this path from the lot, was a sparsly wooded area. Not wooded, but there
were enough trees for that to be a detail that I noticed. In the dream I don't
go past this part, so that part of the dream is not really expanded upon, but
in the dream I knew it to contain picnic tables and things, where families
might bring food and picnic things and have a nice family night out. So in this
dream, the first thing I remember is being in a suburban, similar to the
suburban my mom had when we were growing up, and I am driving this suburban. I
remember my mom being involved in the dream somehow, I think she was in the
passenger side of the vehicle, and Kyle I know was in the back seat. So I'm in
the parking lot, and I remember saying something to the effect of "hey, lets go
over to the creek side of this park, I'd like to show it to you" or something
like that. You see, this from the parking lot of this park, one could drive to
the west (again, irrelevent direction) and towards the west side of the park
it became more dense, there were different things to do, and it was the same
park as the park where families might picnic, but in this area of the park were
sports fields and things of that nature along with a bit more winding road and
such. So I drive over to that part of the park, and at some point along the
ride, I remember making the decision that we were done there and that we wanted
to go home. Instead of using my phone to find the directions home, however, I
remember thinking something like I wanted to just find the way home and I
thought I knew it. So as I start to drive through this other section of the
park, driving as if on autopilot, driving through roads without thinking as if
I had taken this path many times before, Kyle starts reading to me about
Russian pronouncations. You see, I have been learning Russian lately, but I
have only just started, and at this point I have not gone beyond learning the
alphebet, which is why this came up in the dream. So Kyle start showing me
letters, and they just appear in the dream, and I start reciting them back to
him, the way they are pronounced. And what ends up happening is, Kyle gives me
a letter, I give him back the correct answer, but Kyle then tells me it is the
wrong answer. When I question him on it, he insists that it is the wrong
answer. In fact, I remember the letters, it was ю, and я, which are "yoo" and
"ya", and I know for a fact I said something in the dream like, "I know the
backwards R one is Ya" but Kyle kept insisting that it was "ee", and I said no,
"ee" is и, but I didn't put together until just now that they are both backward
versions of other english letters, and in the dream I was just insisting that
the backward R was not the sound "ee" but "ya". I remember getting very upset
in the dream at Kyle, and eventually I made it to a dead end in the road, a
sort of dead end that was the end of a parking lot where soccer moms might park
when their child has a game at the very end of the park, and beyond the soccer
fields I know there was a densly wooded area with a creek that marked the edge
of the park, and I knew that I was lost. So at this point I decide to stop
arguing with Kyle about the russian letters, and I begin to make my way back to
the original parking lot that I mentioned when the dream first started (or
rather back to when I first remember the dream), and when I make it back to
that parking lot, I am met by my dad. I don't remember driving up to him,
(indeed, I don't remember looking out of the car when I was driving at all, and
most of my dream took place inside the scope of the suburban) but I do
remember, when I was right next to him, I pulled up beside him in a parking
spot, and he was simply standing there, and I stopped so that he could open the
passenger side door and get in the car. At this point I think my mom had
magically gotten in the back seat, since she had gone out of my memory by that
point in the dream, and so the passenger seat was open, so my dad got in, and
he was upset, as if I was not doing as I was told, and that he was displeased
with my defience, and he might have said something, but at this point in the
dream I remember conceding to looking up my home address (1700 Tulane Dr., the
address of my parents house) on my phone, and starting up the GPS. At this
point, my dad commanded me to drive home, in the stern way that he does, and
after looking up the address I placed the phone GPS beside me like I do when I
drive with the GPS and began to make my way home. As I began to leave this
parking lot of the park, and go out on the road which ran North-South, which
was just east of the park, and marked the other end of the park, is when the
dream ended.

The reason I spell out this dream is not because I think anything remarkable
happened, but when I woke I was almost in a sweat. I knew I didn't have the
time near my, but looking outside I could tell that while it certainly was
morning, I knew I had not overslept, and I had my tablet next to me, which as I
mentioned in my previous article I have recently acquired, and I went to check
if it had finished it's windows updates, because I remembered that it had to do
that recently, and also to check the time on it, and it said something like
11:38. I had a very breif moment of panic, so breif in fact that the moment of
panic did not even happen as a realized that there was no way that it was past
11, and at the very worst I thought that it could only be 7:38, and the time
was off by a timezone. Upon opening the browser, I found that it was 6:38 in
the central time zone, and at that point I began to wake for real. It was nice,
feeling that awake at that time of day, and since today is a Thrusday and I
have no obligation to make my way to the gym to practice with Paco, I had
plenty of time to collect myself, have some water, drink some juice, rotate the
laundry, and perform some morning tasks that I usually perform in a bit more
hurry (or rather, not hurry, but with a sense of guilt as my morning tasks run
in to the time that I should be at work).

What struck me about this dream though, was two things. The first is my arguing
with Kyle about russian letters, which I now understand was probably my brain
sorting out which backward english letters coorespond to which russian sounds.
The fact that I got so upset at him for that though, actually does concern me,
and I don't feel guilty about it (for how can one ever feel guilty about the
happennings of a dream?) but it did disturb me for quite some time. I also have
been meaning to spend more time learning russian, but have let other things
take precedence, in particular, reading and writing in english, which I greatly
enjoy. So I think there was a bit of apprehension and insecurity about my lack
of learning Russian in the dream as well. There is probably some significance
to the fact that it was Kyle I was getting upset at, and this dream does remind
me of one road trip back in the days when I used to play Go, and I wanted to
try my hand at blind Go during this trip, and I remember getting upset at Kyle,
because he had some sort of handheld device that he was keeping track of and
playing the stones on, and when we got to move 30 or so, I tried to play a
stone and he informed me that a stone had already been played at that position,
and I remember arguing with him that there was not a stone on that position,
and that he must have made some mistake in interpreting the moves I had given
him, because earlier, I had remembered playing in a different way. At that
point, I remember my dad making a comment that the one who could see the stones
was probably right, and maybe he was, but I disliked that my opinion on the
matter was being shrugged off so matter-of-factly, and I remember at the very
lesat thinking that, while it could be true that my memory of the board state
could very easily be wrong, I also had strong memory of playing the stone in a
different position, and not only did I have memory, but I had reasoning as to
why I would have placed that stone in the place I did, and I also knew how the
way I phrased the way the stone was placed could be mis-interpreted by Kyle,
who did not enjoy Go at all in the way I did. So at that point, as I thought to
it, I am almost certain what happened is I told him to place the stone in a
certain way in relation to the other stones (because trying to keep track of
absolute positioning I knew would be too hard for me) and Kyle misinterpreted
my words and placed the stone in the wrong location, and that created a board
state on the handheld which was different than the state in my head. All of
this ended pretty much at that point, because I remember trying to continue on,
but after about 30 stones I knew the board state would be difficult to remember
anyway, as Go board states can get very complicated rather quickly, and this
entire thing was just an attempt to handicap myself to the point where I could
even get Kyle to play with me in the first place, and I knew that he had no
real interest anyway, and that the only reason he would even humor me in that
moment was because of the boredom of a long road trip, so at that point we
dismissed the game, and I remember suggesting perhaps we play for real, but
Kyle didn't want to, and that was that.

That whole experience, and me being upset at both Kyle and in a lesser way my
dad, was the first memory that came in to my mind after I woke from my dream
today. It was probably almost exactly ten or eleven years ago that this
happened, and I am certain that this memory led to the events of the dream
today. In fact, the concept of Kyle giving me "the state of things how it is"
(either a Go board state, or the association of Russian letters to their
pronounciation) and me trying to recall that state from memory is so strikingly
similar that I feel this has to be the reason for the inclusion of Kyle in my
dream today. And also the inclusion of my father as well. That's actually
really fascinating, now that I think about it, how very similar the memory fits
the dream, but with my current task of learning Russian rather than my task of
playing a game of Go.

So yeah, most of this session has been dominated by that dream, so much so that
I haven't even got to the second part I wanted to talk about which is the text
(or rather, group text sent to me, my brothers, lacey, and Granny and Papa)
sent by my mom. The reason I find this text so interesting is a couple things.
The first is that I didn't fully understand the text at first, and actually had
to look up a word to understand really what was going on, and the second is my
reaction to it. So enough mystery about it, this is the text in it's entirety.

    Text Message
    Tuesday 11:17 AM
    Ann Webster Family

    We just had the
    blessing of the cells
    with the Chaplin and
    they are hanging the
    stem cells.

That is the exact text as it appears in my phone as of this moment. One thing I
will say is that I did not see this text until I got back from Jiu-Jitsu class
that lunch, which would have been about an hour later, and by that point,
multiple people had responded with things like "praying for you" and stuff like
that. There was also a text sent from my mom sent at 11:28 (after both her
parents had responded) saying "\*chaplian" (escape sequence mine since
markdown), which followed with a text from Lacey, also giving her prayers.

So what struck me first about this was, I when I first saw this message, it
showed up as seven messages in my phone, since it was a group message and a
bunch had already responded. (Me nor any of my brothers responded) So when I
read the first message, I didn't know what a Chaplin was, and the correction to
chaplain didn't help either. When I first read the message, I just saw
"blessing" and thought she was asking for blessings, like someone may do,
similar to how someone may ask for prayers, but upon reading it further, I
realized that it read "the blessing of the cells", so I thought maybe she was
asking for us to pray for the cells to be blessed, which I also thought was
strange, but I know both my parent but particularly my mom can be very
superstitious when it comes to religion and things of that nature. My mom is
the sort that believes in the bible literally, and takes the six thousand year
interpretation of the world to be the actual truth. I don't resent her for it
(much), but I am fascintated by it because she is otherwise a rather
intelligent woman. However, upon getting to the point where I could entirely
read the message and comprehend what it said, I noticed that "the blessing of
the cells" was an event that happened with "the Chaplin" (chaplain as she
corrected herself later) and that it was an event that happened before the
transfusion. This is all I have to go on.

Now, at this point, I very much want to say that I do not intend to bring this
up pretty much to anyone. It was one text message, and if some ass hole wants
to give his blessing to a bag of Evan's blood before an extremely delicate and
scary (there must be a better word than scary to describe the chance of 20
percent death and 50 percent prognosis, as I don't want to portray fear, but
rather the sense of, this shit is serious and must be taken seriously)
infusion, and if that blessing make my mom, and maybe my dad too, I don't know,
but definitely my mom, feel better, than so be it. I don't care of the pope
himself comes with his stupid hat kisses the rod they use to hang, as long as
the pope isn't ill and it doesn't effect the procedure in any way. However, I
did not know what I chaplain was, and had to look it up to find out that a
chaplain is like a pastor, but the word chaplain is used when he is the
religous figure of an institution such as a hospital or prison or other such
place, so that the cells were blessed by the guy who I'm sure does this shit
all the time around there.

And that is what got me to thinking, how gross and disgusting that practice is.
I'm all for giving people a sense of hope or meaning, that kind of shit is what
things like Christianity is for, it's for people who don't have an explanation
for the things that happen in the world and inside ourselves, so they come to
the lowest hanging fruit because that fruit makes sense to them, and if eating
of that fruit helps them cope, or deal, or otherwise make better of their lives
in a positive way, than who am I to say that the fruit isn't there and that
it's the product of thousands of years of in-factual cultural evolution?
However, it's not the actual blessing of the cells which disgusts me, it's the
concept that somehow this chaplain has more right, or more capability, or more
divinity with the lord that he should do it rather than someone close to the
people involved. This is how this ass hole makes his living, is by telling
people that he is able to bless their cells, and that the lord will guide the
doctors hands, and he will use this farce to give hope to people in desperate
situations, and that's how he makes his living. It's fucking gross. Like
despicably gross.

And obviously, even bringing up the topic of this text message would be wrong
to do with my family, even my brothers. Perhaps Jason would be the only one I
would come close to saying anything to, but he and I aren't close enough that
something as trival as this text message that we both received would be a topic
of conversation that he and I would have together. So instead this is something
that will most likely never be discuss except long in the future when my dad
has recovered and I bring it up in a conversation over dinner or something, and
even then it the topic of religion is still such a touchy one, even with my
mom, that we are all wise enough to avoid the subject completely. So this is
what I'm left with.

I could go on a little bit, but I'm over my time and I have to get back to
work, so I will leave it at that. It just gives me a strange sense of discord,
not only my opinion of this text message and also my reaction to it and the
fact that I can't rectify it by bringing it up. It's amazing how utterly wrong
and disgusted it makes me feel over something that shouldn't be that big of a
deal. And it's not that big of a deal, I can very easily move on with my life,
but this is just one more thing about religion and my parents that will never
be aligned, and it makes me want to vomit. That is all.

Until next time.

# 20180629 Dreams: Psilocibin, Colorado trip ski lift, Kim in Seattle - Convesation with my mom
Okay, so I had another dream today that I want to share briefly. I did not
intend for this to become a dream journal, but as long as I am having vivid and
memorable dreams that can be interpreted easily, I will continue to write about
them, and if nothing else it gives me a topic to get into the flow of writing
as I start each entry. At this moment, I haven't ever come to a point where I
feel like I have nothing to say, but I am only three articles in at this point
and who knows when I have been doing this for a few weeks I might become
exhausted of this exercise and feel as though it becomes wearisome, or
repetitive, or some other such feeling, and I don't want that, and writing
about dreams I think will help not only for me to have more memorable dreams
(because I really do love waking up and thinking about a dream) but also it
will help in sparking ideas to write about here.

So without further ado, this particular dream was a three parter. I don't
recall much about the first part, except that it invovlved Isiah from BJJ, who
I have not actually interacted much with as of late, but is a pretty cool guy,
and I end up eating Psilocibin Mushrooms with him in the dream. He shows me a
stash, and I take some of it and I eat them, and there is a particularly large
cap that he says I should only eat if I'm feeling very adventurous, and I end
up eating it.  I don't remember much of the dream beyond those details. The
mushrooms were in a room which was like Grant's room in Denton, but that
location has not come up before in my dreams, so it seems a bit minor of a
detail.

The second part of the dream involved me going to Colorado. I was with someone,
I forget who, but in this instance of going to Colorado, it was Peter and
Madison, and me and I'm pretty sure this someone was a girl, and instead of
driving there, we decided to take the ski lifts there. Obviously that's absurd,
but in the dream there was a network of ski lift like infrastructure for
trasportation, and Peter and Madison were in the seat in front of us, and me
and this girl (who I didn't interact with much, and I even forget if she was a
girl or not) were together in the seat behind them. The most striking thing
about this dream was a couple things. Most of the dream was about dialog
between Peter and I as he turned back and we discussed things, although the
actual dialog, and even what the dialog was regarding escapes me at this time.
The two notable things were this. One, I remember a moment, when we are going
over one of the poles that holds up the ski lift, where Peter and Madison after
they went over it turn back and inform us to be careful of that pole, and I
remember thinking that it can't be too bad, but when we go over it, we bounce
quite violently, and I had to hold myself in the dream to keep from falling out
of the lift. The second thing I remember is, shortly after this bump (the ride
was mostly smooth besides that one massive bump) we decide to stop at one of
the stops (because this ski lift like apparatus had stops along the way) and
visit another place before reaching our destination. This place is another
dream location that is extremely memorable for me, and I know I've written
about before, but this section of the dream ended before we explored it again.
It is difficult for me to recall the dream where this location was in the past,
but the location can best be described as a deserty area with lots of mountains
that have flat tops that come up and create canyon like valleys between them,
and the entire desert area is a pilgramage type thing with the start of the
pilgramage being a water place with lots of grassy mounds that create a lot of
paths, where lots of people go to recreate in, followed by this plilgramage
desert thing, and followed by an indoor hallway that goes to a snowy place. I
don't want to spend too much time describeing this whole thing because that is
another dream, and the only detail is that we decided to stop at the first area
just to check it out before getting back on the lift.  However, we merely
decided that, and this portion of the dream ended before we even really got off
the lift. I don't have memory of getting off the lift, only that we intended to
do so.

The final part of the dream is the most beautiful, and as I was waking up I
only wanted to go back to sleep to experience more of this dream. What made
this section of the dream beautiful was not anything that happened in the
dream, but the beauty of the locale. In this section of the dream, I was
returning to Seattle, the dream version of Seattle that I have had before, and
in this dream version of Seattle, as I was driving up, there is a point you hit
where you get there, and the whole thing is like one path that goes around this
great mound, and from the top of this section of the path, you can see the path
going off to the left, and a whole grassy area that is the mound that doesn't
have any path on it, but instead is just a great grass that goes down almost
like a ski slope with trees on each side and everything, and from the top here
you can see the beautiful water off in the distance, the water of Seattle that
is a bit like the lake that you see from Lakeview drive when I first got to
Seattle with all the boats and everything out there, but the dream version
where it's even more open, more diverse and so much more expansive and
wonderful. So this section of the dream was mostly me driving my way to this
hill top place, and me observing the humble sights, those sights which are also
breathtaking in the dream but that I can't recall in their details, as I
thought about my destination. I remember thinking about the destination as I
was driving there, and in this dream I was also on my way to meet Kim, the girl
I dated twice in college, as in a went on two seperate dates with her. The
reason Kim comes up I think is two reasons. The first and less artistic reason
is because I seem to recall seeing pictures of her on facebook at one point
visiting Seattle. I could be wrong on that point but I remember seeing it and
memory is the only important thing in dreams. The second is that, while I was
in seattle, and I was smoking all the weed and getting unreasonably high all
the time, I remember having a sketch notebook that was an absurd size,
something like 11x14, and I had this idea of using flower and star patterns to
create a scene I would call "Kim and Brett on the Rooftop" which would portray
in a sense the scene of her and I sitting on the roof of building at UTD, where
we sat after our second "date", and we just sat there for 10 minutes, and as we
sat there I thought about her, and about our dates, and I just decided that it
wasn't really flying. I thought about how I could have gone in to make a move,
to try and kiss her or something, but it felt wrong, like it was disingenuous,
and that I would simply be doing it to keep up with the social norms of what
that date and what that moment would have been like in a movie. This was a
beautiful moment for me, because though my kiss with Maddie months before had
been very bold "pink" in my memory of what that was like, this was instead the
most beautiful "gray" memory I can have. It was resolve, it was knowing that
Kim and I just weren't sparking, and I saw the beauty of that in that moment,
and it's more beautiful than grey. This happened I think my senior year, before
Scarlett, and Seattle was obviously after Scarlett, and I had wanted to capture
this moment in art somehow, but even in Seattle I wasn't able to find the
inspiration to make that piece, and I probably never will. Maybe I will at some
point, but I would have to go back to Seattle and smoke a lot of weed and go to
a particular park and find a spot on a bench that I have very clearly in my
mind, the same park where Sockeye tryouts were (and I only mention those
tryouts as an identifier and not because I want to associate this with those
tryouts in any way) and I would have to sit there with the very same sketchbook
with a pencil and make it appear, as if something else were guiding my hand.
That may happen in my life time, but maybe not, we will see. Anyway, that huge
tangent I went on merely to say, in this dream, I was driving to meet her
there, and I remember thinking about the junction of this top of the hill in
the dream world and the lake water view from there. And when I arrived there, I
remember stopping the car to park, because the rest would be a walk down to the
part of that section in the dream world that is at the bottom of the hill where
there is a VIP club that I am welcome to (and I am welcome there just because
it's my dream world and it would be weird if I weren't, I suppose I could be
rejected but that is not this club), and I was planning to walk down and meet
Kim at the entrance to that club so we could go down to the water and go on a
long walk together and reunite after a long time. I want to be clear that I
have no intention of reuniting with the real Kim, we truly were incompatible
chemistry wise when we dated, but this dream version of her represents a sort
of non-sexual uniting of two souls that miss eachother and want to see
eachother. She represents something inside of me, especially in this dream and
not in my active conscious mind. And so I remember in this dream, I made it to
this ridge, and I stopped and got out of my car, and stood there and was taken
away by the view. I was not taken away in the sense that I lost my senses or my
capabilities, but instead I simply looked out and took in it's beauty, a beauty
which I knew was there but always manages to take you everytime you take it
even though you know what you're about to see, and I acknowledged this feeling
of admiration, serene beauty, and I accepted it and turned toward the path to
see something I didn't expect. What I had expected was to go along this path on
my own, and to meet Kim at the bottom like I said, but instead when I turned to
the path, I saw her there, eager to meet me, a bit in the distance but not so
far that I was entirely sure that it was her and I could examine what she was
wearing, perhaps 100 meters in dream distance, and I saw she was wearing a
rather intricate swimsuit, the kind of swimsuit which would accentuate all of
her best feminine features, but at the same time modest, something she herself
might call cute, but I could only call the perfect swimsuit for her body at
that time as I saw, as if she gave thought to who I was and what I would like
to see her wear. And all of this I must remind you was all taken very
non-sexually, as if we were more acquainted than we actually are in real life
and we had shared intimate things before, as if our dating experienced turned
not into a relationship that would have a definite "break-up" point, but as if
our relationship would have turned from a couple dates of two people that don't
spark to a sort of comfort in sharing things with eachother that we would come
to eachother to discuss things and meet for food occasionally to talk about
mundane things like how our new job was going or how our life endeavors were
treating us, and through this relationship we hadn't met in a long time since
life had taken us different directions, but now life brought us back into the
same direction again and we were meeting again and we both had accepted and
were glad in the sort of relationship that we had had as two human beings, and
I saw her there, and with that feeling I saw her and was wholly surprised,
because I did not expect to see her at this juncture and expected to meet her
further down, but she had walked up to meet me and had been waiting for not too
long, because she was expecting me and knew when I would arrive, and when I saw
her I was taken by surprise and then a feeling of warmth that can only be
described in the context of this terrible run-on sentance which I should be
punished for writing. I saw her there, her beauty coming out through the
swimsuit she was wearing, and she smiled upon seeing me, and I smiled as well,
and we came towards eachother and we shared a hug. We embraced breifly, me
feeling her body and her swimsuit against my clothed self and noting the
juxtaposition of those two feelings, swimsuit and clothes, and the embrace was
breif but when it ended we stil held hands I told her that I wasn't expecting
to see her here, and that she didn't have to climb all the way up here, and she
replied that she knew that, but wanted to surprise me, to which I replied that
she looked beautiful, and that the backdrop of the water only made her more
beautiful, and then I took her hand and we both looked out to the water and
took in it's beauty together, both admiring it, but at the same time both
maintaining our facilities, our wits so to speak, not letting the beauty
control our emotions but instead letting the beauty become a part of our
emotions, and I looked out upon it, upon that scene, and everything felt right
with the world. And at that moment, we turned back to eachother, made eye
contact, and without even talking to eachother we both knew that I was to take
her hand and lead her down to the lake where there was water and we would walk
and talk and share eachother at that gorgeous scene.

It was at this point that I woke up. I will remark that I know last night I
slept naked, and I do not recall having any morning wood when I woke, and I
usually make some note of morning wood, especially now that I have abstained
from masturbation. I make this point only to say that there was no sexual
interest or motivation for this dream, and that the beauty of it was not the
sort of sensual and sexual beauty that we as mammals of the homo sapien race
only so much like to indulge in, but instead the beauty is the kind of beauty
that makes you feel utter awe, not even like you're lucky to be alive and
witness it, but just that it takes you away, not taking away your senses or
reasonableness, but instead the sort of beauty that fills you with awe and
becomes just another part of the whole beautiful stirring pot that is our
emotions.

When I woke, all I wanted to do was go back to sleep to experience more of the
dream again, but alas, that was not to be, as I had to make my way to training.

Speaking of, I have had so far a great day as far as training is concerned.
Paco taught a lot of standup things that I like a lot, and we had a very good
morning session. Also, today I had some very good rolls with people at no-gi
open mat, one with the little short hispanic dude who I am friends with on
facebook but I forget what his preferred name of reference is. David is my
guess, as that is his middle name on facebook, and his first name is something
like Fredricco or something, but yeah.

I think I have decided to forego registering for the Five grappling tourney.
This is something I have been struggling with lately, and I don't know if it is
connected, but I had a lot of anxiety for Dallas open, and I am getting a lot
of anxity for this tournament, and I can't help but think that I have created
an association with my loss in Denver to my subsequent drive home and visit in
jail only fifteen hours later, and that association is acting as a strong
catalyst for my tournament anxiety. Obviously I have gotten tournament anxiety
in the past, but this is on a new level. And I hate that I am feeling this
anxiety, but I think it is wise to respect it, and take a break from the
tournament scene. As much as it pains me, I really don't want to sign up for a
tournament and lose, as I already have excuses for my losing and I see that as
the expected outcome. Indeed, I am a new blue belt, and I know there are a lot
of killer blue belts out there, and I know this is something that everyone
struggles with, but there is something more. It's not that I expect to lose,
but it is more that I think I associate now the feeling of lose with my
experience in jail, which is a horrible thing to associate. The thing is, I
don't know if it would be wise to compete anyway to overcome that anxiety, or
instead to just wait it out until the weight of that felony charge is entirely
off my shoulders. As much as I don't want the latter to be the case, and as
silly and stupid as that sounds, either win or lose I don't expect to gain much
from competing. Rather, I think what I should do is go to more open mats, and
expose myself to more training partners, so that rather that discovering myself
and my Jiu-Jitsu through competition, discover it more organically and more
playfully through increased exposure. I am sure that I will compete again, and
I will certainly still be a blue belt when this felony charge gets resolved, so
I feel most confident in waiting this out. I'm am still mentally conflicted,
but in my heart this makes the most sense to me.

I almost forgot what I really wanted to journal about today. That thing was the
interaction with my mom yesterday. So yesterday, or the day before, I forget, I
wrote about how I have this feeling, similar to the feeling of Aloysha with
Father Zossima in Brothers Karamazov, where I have this need to stay with my
father in this time. So Thursday, I called my mom after work, but before yoga,
at around 5:30 in the afternoon, and when I called her and she answered I could
tell immediately that I woke her. Her voice was distant and vague, and I quite
honestly think I have never heard that voice before. It reminded me of the
voice of Ciara when she would wake. I like that voice, but upon hearing it I
knew I woke her. The conversation started like that. I called, and she answered
after about three or four rings, and she said "hello" in a very delierious
voice. I replied in a bit more of an enthusastic voice and I said hey, and let
there be a silence for a bit. After that silence, I then continued on with
the start of the conversation, which we had talked about having before, saying
that I was calling just to catch up on how things were going and to see if it
would be okay to visit. What followed was about six to eight or so minutes of
her describing to me my fathers condition, how he has been having diareahha and
fevers and is running a 104.5 temperature, and she mentioned a lot of things
about blood counts and transfusions and lots of other things that the doctors
have been doing to keep it under control. I stood there, in the stairwell of my
workplace just listening to her talk, mostly just taking it in and not
responding at all in any way, and instead just letting her talk and tell me
the things that she wanted to tell me. She also mentioned how she can't even
bring in water and other things into the room because his immune system is so
compromised and such that they can't risk anything to infect him, and she went
on like this like I said for over six minutes. Towards the end I started
contibuting with things such as "yeah" or "hmm" or "right" but I still just
stood there, pacing, and listening. And this sort of thing is what I knew he
would be going through, but hearing it from my mother made it more real in a
sense. I knew it would be rough, but I wasn't sure in what way it would be
rough, so it was interesting to here her talk to me about my fathers condition.
And listening to her, I got the very distinct impression that she very much
didn't want me to come, and I say this for this reason. So many times,
especially, and I have memories of this as a child, coming back from Houston
after visiting family, my mother and father would discuss events and
conversations of the previous week or weekend or whatever, and they would talk
about different people in the extended family, and their discussion would
always be in a sort of "negative but benefit of the doubt" tone. Saying things
like "and did you see what she was wearing" or "yeah, she stayed fixated on
that topic of conversation for so long" and other things about the things
people said, and the things people wore, and how someone acted in a certain way
in a certain setting. And not only that but they would always do so in a way so
as to speak poorly of the people which we had just had conversation with and
shared time with. And I paint this in perhaps too negative of a light, because
I know surely they also talked about good things too, like relatives of
relatives getting a new job or talking about how some new significant other was
good for someone, and things such as that, but in my memory, I remember this
sharply, because I would always reflect on their conversation and tone as I
eavsdropped their words from the back of the car, and I would contrast that to
the conversation and tone that they had during the events and during the
gatherings, and they were so remarkably different that it rose in me a feeling
of disgust. And the disgust was at the sheer two-facedness of it all, because
though I did enjoy our gatherings to an extent, I was generally speaking very
much against them as a child, not only becasue they were always sandwiched
between a long drive from home to Houston and back, but also because I took
very little interest in the conversations of adults, and would have only my
handheld video games to ammuse myself during the whole time, and while I
enjoyed playing video games, I selfishly saw no reason to bring ourselves so
often to this entirely different city to play video games there, when I could
have just as easily stayed at home and played the console games that I
generally enjoyed more. Indeed, as a child I was quite bent on playing video
games in most of my free time, but I digress. My point is, the distaste for
these gatherings that I had in myself, I was always as open as I could be about
them, and would keep to myself in the corner with my games and make my
appearances as I was obligated to, and I would be cordial enough simply because
that was the path of least resistance, all the while my parents would continue
with the festivities and the nicities and all of the other obligations of
socail interactions with extended family, and they would give an air of
enjoying themselves that I thought could only be false as I listened to them
speak back on the whole experience in the car ride back. Of course, in more
adult eyes looking back, I see that one can still enjoy oneself and still
gossip ruefully about the people you enjoyed, but I rarely enjoyed myself in
anyway and saw this same distaste in their ride back. I mention all of this to
say, I know both sides to my parents, both the outward side that they show to
their family, and the inner side that they share with only eachother, but which
I as their child was able to overhear in that situation, and knowing both those
sides, I could sense something in this in the conversation with my mom
yesterday. Indeed, she was being entirely genuine with me as she explained for
her time my father's condition, and when she was done I started talking for a
bit about how I'm not sure where it comes from but lately I have had this
feeling that I need to visit more, but even as I was saying something so short
as that my mom would inturrupt me in my words to attend to the nurses that were
there caring for my father and to attend to her motherly duties that I know she
feels so strongly for in herself, and even as I said my words, I could get the
sense that she very much did not want me to visit. So after I was inturrupted
briefly in the middle of my short thought, I finished the thought, but instead
of going on to the next thought that I would have shared had I not gotten this
sense from her, I instead put the ball in her court, and gave her entierly the
option to tell me to just stay the fuck away. But, of course, since my mom is
too nice, she did not take that opportunity, and instead we went back and forth
a little bit about how my father's condition again as if to deter me. I then
said something to the effect of how I don't mind those things and still feel
strongly like you both need my support, but I did then go on to say that I'm
not sure if visiting is the right way to support, again giving her the
opportunity to tell me to stay the fuck away, but of course again she didn't
take and said how she wasn't sure either. So at this point I left the stairwell
and said something like, "well, how about I go to yoga and I'll text you when
I'm done and we can go from there" and even at that point she kept saying how
she would text me, but even in that I could sense that she wasn't sure what she
was meant to do, at which point I said something like, "No, don't even think
about me, I'll text you and if you don't reply I'll just assume your sleeping
or something and I won't bother you any further" and we left it at that before
we shared our conversation ending formalities and I moved on.

The entire conversation lasted something like nine minutes if I recall
correctly from what my phone read. Looking back the call started at 5:30 and
lasted 8 minutes total. And I remember when I finished, and I looked at my
phone, I was in a position where my office was to my right, and the parking
garage was on my left, and I could see 114 the road that would lead to the
hospital on the right and to yoga to the left. And I looked at all these things
and I was able to put together the map of everything in my head along with the
timeline of how things would go in the future, and again like I said about my
perspective on the tournament earlier in this entry, I knew in my heart what
the correct thing to do was but my mind and reasoning and logic hadn't
proccessed everything yet, and so I felt conflicted mentally but not
emotionally, but the mental conflict indeed does create a sort of emotional
one, but this confict was instead a sort of destruction of my emotions as I
forced myself to try and see this entire thing from a logical and zoomed out
perspective.

In that moment, the primary thought in my head was actually the same as
Aloysha's in the Brothers Karamazov, after he joined the hands of Ivan and
Katerina, of that of a righteous fool. Indeed, where did my feeling of being
with my father come from? And why only just now did it make sense for me to
support them in this time. My father was in no state to be presentable. I
thought back to my experience in the hospital, and I felt shame at my present
state more than anything. I didn't want people to see me in that state, I
wanted to find my inner peace, and endure my feelings of pain and also the
feelings of narcotic numbing on my own, without the sympathy of others. I was
in a pitiful state, and I did not want to receive pity, as receiving pity only
made me feel more pitiful, and I didn't want to feel more pitiful but less
pitiful, so I wanted all the people who meant well and cared for me and wanted
to be there for me to go away so that I could enjoy (indeed, enjoy is the word,
but not in its traditional sense) my suffering in peace, and on my own, so that
I could find my inner self and use that inner self to get through my time
there. And I have talked about this with my father, and though he has said
otherwise (indeed, my father is much more extraverted than I, who consider
myself having a rather extreme, if not maybe a little disengenuous, case of
introversion), I thought about my own feelings and emotions. Indeed, if my
feeling of being with my father is genuine, why is it just now eight months
after he has been diagnosed, that I feel the need to see him? I know in myself
what changed, but those changes are only recent, and quite honestly they don't
hold up to scrutiny. What a saintly fool I am!

Indeed, it would make sense to visit my father just to be with him in his
current state in the heat of battle, as his body attempts aggressively to
accept the stem cells donated by my brother Evan, if I had been there for him
in his other states, but I have not and have only visited sporadically and in
times of better health, in the times between his treatments of Chemo where he
is feeling higher energy and less beaten down. If I had visited in his lower
times there, if my feelings of being there for him and for my mom had been much
stronger like they are now before in the past eight months and I had seen him
in his pitiful and beaten states and helped him through those times, and I knew
that my support in those other moments were appreciated, and that it helped,
and that I provided something for him, if I had been there in those moments
with that effect, then surely I would have insisted that I visit in this moment
as well. But I didn't, and so why now, at the time when he is beaten down the
worst, after I had so many opportunities to give my visits and my support a
test drive, why now at the worst time should I give my support a try? I of
course have my best intentions in mind, but my past actions make it so I can't
follow through on these feelings I have, it doesn't make sense, because I would
I know that I would be doing more good than harm?

And this is where I go back to the conversation with my mother. In that moment,
looking left and right at all the things I would do in that moment, I hadn't
gone through those thoughts yet, but my emotions knew them, and my thoughts
eventually independently came to the same line as my heart as I made my way to
my car and drove out of the parking garage and made my way west to yoga. I
struggled through my thoughts, doing my best to become an observer of my
emotions but not letting them guide my thoughts, and the thoughts I just
described above are the thoughts I came to in that drive. And when I arrived at
yoga I knew that it was not right for me, in that moment, being unable to
change the past eight months of my actions, to visit my father that evening.
Instead, I knew it was right to send my mother a message indicating my
intentions at that moment, and to instead find another time to visit my
parents.

I also thought back to my visit that weekend, where my father told me that he
knew he was going to get through this. My mother and father have gotten through
this so far with the support and everything else that has guided them through
this battle, and they can continue to do what has worked. This has been eight
months for them supporting eachother through this, and at this sort of climax
of it, they can continue to do so. If I were a wishing man I would be wishing
that I could go back in time and change myself, tell myself to visit more
through the poor times as much as the good times, but I didn't do that already,
and it's foolish to wish for such things. Instead, I can try and give my
support in the best way I can.

So after I finished the Bikram yoga class, I messaged my mom and said this.

    So, after our convesation I thought about and think it would be wise to not
    visit tonight and let you both get rest. Have some of my strength as you
    both go through this today, and I'll keep up to date with caring bridge and
    messages. Much love.

To which my mom replied with

    Thank you for making the decision! I am not great at making those right
    now. Love you too!

That message did not come until two minutes later, and at that point I had
already put the phone in the shoe and gone to the Yin class which I had decided
last minute that I wanted to join. And I had a great Bikram class and a great
Yin class.

On a much lighter note, the speed dating event that I signed up for was
canceled tommorrow, and will happen instead like a full fucking month from now.
At first I was really dissappointed about that, but instead I thought about it
and that gives me an opportunity to go to the Roughnecks game tomorrow, which
will be fun. It's a blessing in disguise I think. I will plan on messaging my
mom tomorrow to see how my dad is doing, and to see if visiting is something
that will make sense at that point. If it is, I think the plan will be to go to
the 3 o clock bikram class tomorrow, and then the Roughnecks game after, which
means I'll have time either around noon or just after noon (or before noon) to
visit. Before noon actually probably makes the most sense, but I don't know
what the state of "eating food" will be for my dad but if it's okay than before
noon would be a good time so that he can socialize and eat, if he is in a state
where socializing and eating is going to be a thing that is even on his mind.
This time I will be more keen on the signals I get from my mom and see what to
do from there.

# 20180630 Dream, trapdoor and father, event of Papa and us at Bavarian Grill
So today was the day that I was planning on doing the speed dating event, but
that was canceled so instead I am going to plan on going to the Roughnecks game
in about an hour. I will arrive late, but fuck it, I don't want to watch the
first quarter anyway.

I still haven't decided if I want to do this journaling in the morning or the
afternoon. I want learning the Russian language to take priority, not only
because I do want to seriously learn it, but also because I feel that the
morning while the brain is still warming up is the best time to learn something
so taxing as learning a language, and my mind will be more receptive to the new
words and concepts and grammatical ideas in the morning compared to later in
the day, I know that. However, if I am to follow the trend of writing down my
dreams in this journal, I should definitely write sooner rather than later as I
am apt to forget my dreams by this time in the after noon. Indeed, it is late
now, 5:30, after the time when I would normally get off of work, and I had a
dream but I have forgotten most of it by this point, so that leaves me in a bit
of a predicament. I might elect to write about the dream first, if I have one,
and do this journalling just before I begin doing my Russian work for the day,
with some actual work thrown in the mix in the morning so I don't feel too
guilty about the whole thing, all before going to Jiu-Jitsu, at which point I
could return, do my work in the afternoon, along with whatever reading I want
to get done. That seems like the best course of action. Indeed, also, I feel as
though I tend to have the most ideas of what to write about in the morning, and
currently when I have those ideas, I will try to make note of them in my head
so that I remember them when I get to the journal, but later in the afternoon,
not only has the magic or spark of those ideas escaped, if not even the idea
entirely, but my motivation to write about these things has passed. I would
then leave my media consumption to the evening, be that a Russian TV show, or
novel reading, or my mastabatory youtube watching, just before bed as I am
eating my meal for the day. I think that is the best course of action when it
comes to the schedule for how these things will probably end up turning out.

So about this dream. Like I said, I don't remember much about my dream. I know
earlier in the day I had memory of it before the point that I have memory now,
but the earliest I can remember is, I was in a sort of rusty trapdoor, and I
was walking back in to it after looking around for my father. I was looking
around this area, and I don't remember what happenend at that point or what the
area was like, but I do remember having a sort of sense of "actually, let's
pretend like I was never looking here and escape back and pretend like I wasn't
doing this" which I think is probably a sense of my feeling to be with my
father followed by my recent events of calling myself a righteous fool put
together in a sort of dream way, and so after I was done exploring this area, I
was going to go back down into this rusty trap door which led to I don't know
where, at which point my father, along with some of his work colleagues which I
have never met but heard of before and have pictures in my head of what I
imagine their faces look like, finds me escaping down this trap door and says
something like "Hey, what are you doing here," in a very good natured and
surprised to see me sort of way. I remember at that point, I had that instant
where, when you are trying to fabricate an alibi, and the entire reason for
that alibi vanishes instantly before it can be used and you decide to entirely
abandon it and pretend like you weren't trying to fabricate an alibi, at that
moment I entirly abandoned my alibi and immediatly came up with a different
one, closer to the truth, saying that I was just coming here to look for him,
which was partially true but I made it sound like I had just started looking
and was coming up the trapdoor rather than going down it. My father took this,
and I came up to him, and the only other thing I am able to remember about this
dream was that, after I woke up, I got the very strong feeling that one does
when having a dream that it was my dream self understanding the situation
better than my real self, and that my father was good enough to visit today and
that I should go through with my plan to visit.

So taking this article through the rest of the day then, most of this day I
have been scraping through resources on the Russian language, looking through
various textbooks, youtube videos, tv shows, and articles, and whatever else,
trying to find the best resource for me to use to learn Russian. In between, I
began reading the B and N version of the Aeneid that I purchased some days ago,
and despite it being an somewhat archaic one, I find it to be quite readable
actual, more so than a lot of other translations of ancient works like this
one, and I quite like it because in the notes of the translation it talks about
the traslators great care in trying to maintain the tone of the original
without sacrificing the readability of it. The effect is something quite
noticably "old poemey" which I dislike a bit, but something which I believe I
will quite enjoy actually.

After doing that for some time, I called my mom and talked with here a bit. I
called her just before noon, after I was browsing reddit looking at my nsfw
subs for a bit and weirding myself out a touch, I gave myself ample time
in-between doing that and calling her so as to not feel so strange about it. In
fact, I think that is when I read the aeneid. Regardless, when I called her,
she was clearly distruaght to a point, but I feel she is staying strong, but
she was talking to be about my fathers condition, and she mentioned his dignity
(which was the word I was looking for earlier, I used pitiful earlier, but
dignity is a much better word here) and I mentiond that I entirely understad
that. Basically, I would have visited, except that she was planning on coming
back to the house to shower and gather herself and work through an issue with
her Fidelity credit card and other such housekeeping things, as well as to
visit Kyle and Evan and Granny and Papa while they were all together at the
house, and so I decided that while she does all of that, it made the most sense
to me to forgoe the visit today, and make the visit tomorrow. I don't imagine
that my fathers condition will be any different tomorrow, but my mom
understands as I do that the visit is certainly not going to be a sociable one,
as all sense of modesty and visitation has entirely vanished as of late. She
mentioned something about the doctors wanting to give my father steroids to
stop the "turf war" as she called it between my dad's still fighting cells and
Evan's transfused cells, and apparently that turf war is still going on to an
effect that is beyond what they had hoped for, and if it continues this way
they will hope to give him steroids which will kill a lot of the transfused
cells so they really don't want to do that but they might have to. I don't know
how that all works, as I am not a doctor after all, but regardless, my father
is in poor condition, but that was to be expected, and all of these things are
tactics that go in to the strategy of making a bone marrow transplant.

Also, as I mentioned, my grandparents are in town, and they texted me yesterday
asking me if we wanted to go to the german restaurant, the Bavarian Grill, for
dinner. I replied that I had plans for the evening but I could go late, and
that worked for everyone, so I ended up eating with them yesterday evening. I
had a pleasent conversation with my grandfather on my mothers side (indeed, as
you probably know my father's father was dead before I was born and his mother
died of old age about five years ago now) about his experience learing french
late in life like he did. I asked him at what age he decided to try and learn
French, and he told me that it was around his retirement, which was around age
55 for him. Mostly I was interested in how fluent and conversational he was
able to get with it, and he said that he was never able to get to the point
where he was truly thinking in french, and he was always thinking in english
and translating to french in his head. However, he also said that he only took
a nine month course at Rice university, and that he only visited france and
became immersed in it for a few weeks. He mentioned an incident where the train
they were on was coming to a stop before their desired stop, and the announcer
got on in french, and he was able to determine from the announcements that
there was an accident on the rail further ahead, and that they were trying to
clear up the accident and that there would be another train coming for them in
45 minutes or whatever, and he was able to determine that all through great
concentration at that moment, and that was what he felt like the peak of his
french had gotten too. Regardless, it was a pleasent conversation, and we
ended up talking about language and some of their travels and a bunch of other
things.

More amusing at this dinner event, though, was the interaction of my
grandfather with the waiter there. When we were seated and the waiter got us
our order, I could tell that he was not very comfortable with his position, and
gathered that he was probably new. I had ordered water, and I consitently had
to ask him to refill the glass, which is generally something that they do just
as they are passing by, and I wouldn't have minded so much if the glass weren't
so small (it was probably only a 16 oz glass) and if the glass didn't have so
much ice in it and if I hadn't just came from Bikram class and been needing the
water in a bad way. I mention only to illustrate the noviceness of our waiter,
which I don't mind (indeed, I could give my opinion on the uncomfortableness I
feel when being treated and waited on, but that's an entirely different
discussion). So after we finish the meal, and Papa goes to pay for the check,
the waiter returns after a bit of time, and shows him the card. He mentions
that something went wrong and shows my grandfather the black thingy doogy magig
foldy thing whatever that is called, opening it to him showing what I can only
assume is a receipt that says the card was declined. However, my grandfather
was not to keen on taking the hint to read what was being said, and the waiter,
bless his heart, was trying his best to be discreet about the whole thing, said
something like "well, it seems the system hasn't taken the card". My
grandfather then asked, "well is it your system or the card" at which point the
waiter says "well it may have been a bit of both" to which I could only laugh
because at this point I am thinking that the card must have been declined, and
my grandfather gives him another card and as the waiter is walking away, my
grandfather raises his voice to be heard across the table asking "well, was the
card declined or did it just not get run through the system?" at which point
the waiter, in all his attempts to be discrete at that point, eventully fell
into his ineveitable annoucement across the table that the card had been
declined. Kyle and Evan my brothers got great amusement out of this of course,
and after the waiter ran the other card and it was accepted, and my grandfather
had called Fidelity and asked about the transaction and found that there was no
transaction that had been run through there system (indeed, I have later
guessed that there might be something going on on Fidelities end since my mom
was mentioning that she was having troubles with her card as well), when the
waiter got back, and he and my grandfather began exchanging words, the
conversation went something like "well it seems the card wasn't even run,
becaues I called fidelity and they said they had no record of the transaction"
to which the waiter replied that it could have been their network and that this
sort of thing has happened before, to which my grandfather replied, "well hose
your network." Well, I don't know what the fuck "hose your network" means, but
the waiter interpretted this to mean "how old's your network" and replied that
he wouldn't know as he as only been working here two months. At this my
grandfather ended up conceding a bit, and the waiter walked away after
apologizing very sincerely for what was probably the sixth time in five
minutes, and asked us if we would like anything before leaving, making eye
contact with me directly and asking me if I would like more water. I could do
nothing but smile and say "no thank you", and if I would have been on top of my
game I would have been able to make some witty remark about the callousness of
my grandfather in that moment, but I couldn't think of anything clever, and
indeed have not come up with anything clever that I could have said to lighten
the situation even in reflection (although my reflection hasn't been too deep).
Indeed, this waiter should have just been refilling my water glass without
asking my permission to do so, so he was clearly quite new to the whole thing
and was only so unfortunate to come across my grandfather and his hallowed
fidelity card, and as he walked away, rid of us and entirely done with our
table as the check was payed, my grandfather began to laugh. And as my
grandfather laughed, I couldn't help but let out a good laugh as well. Indeed,
seeing him laugh with his great big belly bouncing up and down with each heave
of his voice, as his abdominals contracted and curled him up involunarily into
a hunched position as his laugh got bigger and bigger and less and less
controlled only made me want to laugh even more, and I decided not to supress
it in that moment, and I myself had a great good laugh, the kind of laugh that
you just let out in the moment as I could only feel sympathy for the poor
waiter and understanding of my grandfathers frustration. Indeed, that laugh
came out of me not out of pity for the waiter, but instead at the way my
grandfather handled the entire situation, with the least amount of empathy and
understanding as possible. To see my grandfather interact with that waiter was
something straight out of a comedy, a shakespearean comedy, where the actors go
back and forth with the most absurd clash of personalities, the one being an
old man with a lot of money who would never have his card declined due to a
lack of funds, and the other a young kid just trying to make the best of a
situation and acting in the most timid way. Innocent aggression matches violent
timidness. How funny that was. And I could have supressed that laugh, but I had
no reason to, and certainly a small part of me was laughing with my
grandfather, as I certainly have seen a lot of that assholery behavior in
myself before, but more I was laughing at the perfect storm that was that
scene, and the escalation it came to (indeed, it wasn't even really escalated,
because I know my grandfather and I know his kindheartedness, but that waiter
certainaly had not seen that side of him), and I laughed simply at the fact
that the escalation could have been entirely avoided had my grandfather had
just a touch of empathy for the man, but he didn't, and that was only all too
amusing to me. So I let myself laugh at that scene.

Besides that, as we were leaving I was able to discuss the topic of my arrest
with Kyle, and was able to get his side of the whole thing, which was good to
hear, as he rode with me in my car back to the house, where we finished our
conversation and I made my way back to my apartment.

Indeed, I have to stop now (I am quite done anyway) and make my way to the
Roughnecks game. That's it for today.

# 20180701 Ramblings of a man in the haze of waking - Ramblings of the lit analyzer
So today it is now in the morning, where as yesterday it was the evening time,
like I said I would do in my article yesterday. In fact, I literally just woke
up, and I am still gathering myself as far as waking up and gathering my
senses. You might be able to tell by the lack of grace in my sentence
structure. Yeah, it's very stilted, as if I don't know what I want to talk
about, and I am simply just writing words for the sake of writing words. So be
it, words are fun to write anyway, although it is quite interesting, I can tell
that my writing is much slower than it usually is. I'm not sure if this is
because I am just waking up, or if it is because I have nothing to say.

I do actually have something to say, and I thought about writing about this
last night after I came back from the Roughnecks game, but I didn't and instead
spent my time trying and failing to go to sleep as I wholly decided I wanted to
read anything and everything that I came across, jumping from literary work to
work, even reading various synopses on wikipedia to see if I want to read them,
before finally coming to a mindless hearthstone tournament to ease my mind. I
have this idea for my lit anaylzer, as well as ideas for my workout logger, and
both of those projects have been neglected by me as of late, so I might end up
writing out my ideas for each of those and getting to work on them, and making
one of them my project for the day/evening. Regardless, lets go back to the
events of my life.

Last night I know I had a dream, and I remember having a sort of moment when I
woke up in the night, but not entierly woke up but just that half awake half
not awake at all state that you arrive at sometimes, and in this state I
remember trying to keep in my head some detail about this dream, but even at
the time I remember thinking that it wasn't worth remembering and that the
dream was wholly short and entirely boring, so I don't remember what happened.
If I had a nice dream, similar to the Seattle dream I had a few days ago, then
perhaps this whole, "wake up and start writing immediately" thing would feel
more natural, but as of right now it feels like I am simply writing for the
sake of it without getting anywhere. Although I do say, now that it is a few
minutes past getting into it, and I am beginning to wake up a little better,
this is starting to flow a little better. Actually, I think I will decide to
take a shower, go outside for a bit, collect myself, and think about what I
might want to write about, and come back and continue writing. Yes, let's do
that. I will return.

So I am back now from my walk, which took me about 30 minutes in total to
complete, and I am back and I have a few things I want to talk about.

The first is, I think I am spreading myself a little thin as far as my hobbies
and interests are concerned, and I have been having a hard time finding the
time to do all the things I want to do, and I am not making strategic choices
as to what to sacrifice. That whole point my lie wholey in that statement right
there, but I had this sort of strong feeling about it as I was nearing the end
of my walk, as I was talking to myself about my felony, which was the primary
topic of conversation on my walk. The second has to do with my feeling of out
of place ness at the Roughnecks game, which also might have the whole of the
idea expressed in that statement right there.

So I am definintely being spread thin as far as all the things I want to do,
and I very much ran in to this last night as I was reading from so many
different books and things. I have so many great ideas of things I want to
write and program about, but it seems as though by the time I end up doing
them, I get lost in them, and begin working on them, it's time for bed, and
it's back to the whole grind of work, sleep, eat, train, yoga, repeat, which is
why my work life is beginning to suffer, as that is the path of least
resistance for me right now. At least, it will be the path of least resistance
until I get fired, at which point finding a job will be the path of least
resistance, I think, unfortunately. So with all of that, one can imagine why I
don't want to dedicate myself to a girlfriend, as that would just be one more
additional thing that would occupy my time, and I don't want that.

I would like to brainstorm about the various things I want to continue on with
for my projects, so before I do that I do want to touch on breifly the game
yesterday. The game was a wholly boring game. The wind was a bit strong, not so
strong that the concept of throwing upwind was entirely impossible, but enough
to the point where upwind and downwind scores were just as important a
consideration as breaks and holds, so the way the game ended up going was the
Roughnecks went up by five or six and then proceeded to trade downwind points
with Austin Sol through the third quarter when I left. I sat in my two typical
corners, which were on the downwind side of the field, but even there there
wasn't much to see. The one thing I will say is that I was very impressed by
Steven Borik's play, and he is doing great things for himself for the team. He
was a defensive handler for the team, and he did a very damn good job at it,
finding holes and punching in upwind bombs that you would expect from any calm,
collected, seasoned veteran. I made eye contact with Falkor as I was walking by
the stands, and he made eye contact with me, and that was it. Not even a smile
or anything, just eye contact. I made a smile and a raise of the eyebrows,
which was not returned, so I guess that is the level of our interaction now. I
will surely make comment of it if we ever to stop to talk to eachother on the
field, but unless that happens I'll just let it be for now. I liked him, but I
think he very much looks down on me and has become a bit of a douche now
because of his acheivments in ulitmate, and that's cool with me. I don't
particularly care. Besides that, I ran across Jack who was coming back from Two
Finger, which I didn't realize was this weekend, so we crossed paths as he was
coming in and I was leaving, and shared a pleasent exchange, so that was the
only real redeeming quality of the game yesterday. So enough of that.

So I want to talk about my productivity now. There are two primary projects
which, when I have them under control, will I feel go long ways to increseing
my productivity, and both of those projects are my workout logger, and my
literary analyzer, and on both of them I am just a little bit stuck as to what
I want to do with them. The lit analyzer I have tried to work on a few times,
but I have always gotten stuck at this one aspect of it, and that aspect is the
concept of how exactly do I want to expose the structure of a work? Everytime I
think I find the best way to do something, I think of a better way to do it,
but then when I think about doing it that way, I find reasons why my first way
was better, and I am sort of stuck in this loop of "well how the fuck do you
want to represent literature anyway you asshole?" One consistent piece that has
remained constant throughout, and a piece that I want to keep, is that of
organizing the entire thing into a tree like structure. However, I always run
in to opposing ideas of how to parse the whole of the work into said structure.
What I am doing at this point, is I am putting the authors imposed structure,
being the chapter, and book and section deliniations, all as implicitly part of
the tree (and indeed, this has to be done in order to break the source material
into smaller files, otherwise the entire thing would be too difficult to
manipulate in Vim without becoming annoyed at the unweildiness of the file, so
there are practical reasons for this), but I have noticed sections where
chapters will come to a sort of cliffhanger and the cliffhanger will be
resolved at a later point in the story, even across chapters (Clancy or Dan
Brown or other writers would have this problem for sure), so while the concept
of dividing up my files into chapters for ease of reading is one I want to
keep, when it comes to analyzing the whole of the work, it doesn't make as much
sense to me to keep the author's impossed structure.

So lets go back to a Clancy novel, and use that as a framework for how I want
to analyze this. Let's reduce a novel down into it's simplest forms. A Clancy
novel will generally have multiple threads running through the thing. So in the
prologue, Clancy will kick of his threads, usually three or four of them, and
in doing will then set the stage for the different, at first disconnected
stories that end up coming into eachother. I've had this sort of idea last
night, that each thread would be it's own independent thing, and that it will
contain a list of events that are a part of the thread, but already I run in to
the problem what the best way to represent all of this would be. Take the Lord
of the Rings for instance. I could have Frodo's thread be sepearte from Sam's
thread, even though for the most part they are always together, they do
seperate for part of the novel, and they have different concerns and such
throughout the novel. But this is the problem I run into (and this is perhaps
the questions that I have been asking myself in my head but not making
explicit), is when Sam and Frodo are having dialogue together, what parts of
the dialog go into Sam's thread and which parts of the dialog go in to Frodo's
thread? One method of resolving this would be to say "any time Frodo is
talking, it goes in to Frodo's thread, and any time Sam is talking it goes into
Sam's thread," but I don't like this idea for the reason that, if the whole of
the thread is something like "Sam and Frodo travel through Mordor towards Mount
Doom where they plan to destroy the ring" then the dialog between Sam and Frodo
would all go through that thread, but when Sam and Frodo seperate, it would
have be to be different threads. And that is the problem, is I don't know how
broad I want these threads to be. I have this concept of being able to split at
thread into to, so a thread might have all of the dialog between Sam and Frodo,
and then when Sam is seperated from Frodo, that would create a split in the
thread, and when they are reunited, the thread comes back together, and there
is that way of representing it, so in that way a thread would be something that
has a list of primary actors, and a thread is something approaching more of an
event than an overaching thread. Indeed, in this way, one thread might contain
the events of the fellowship from Loth Lorien to Emyn Muil, and then that
thread would end there, and the we'd have new threads for Merry and Pippen,
Aragorn Gimli and Legolas, and Frodo and Sam, and then the Merry and Pippen
thread would combine with the Aragorn and Gimli and Legolas thread when they
meet back up, which would be a new thread there, and so on, and one can imagine
how this would go. What I don't like about this is, suppose I wanted to
extract Frodo's journey to Mordor out of these threads, I would simply find all
of the threads that contain Frodo, and say that that is Frodo's thread, but
then that thread would contain all of the dialog of the fellowship between say
Aragorn and Boromir, and while Frodo is there for that dialog, he is not a part
of it in any way, so again I am at a loss as to the best way to do this, and I
go back and forth as to how this should be represented.

So at this point I think it is important to take a step back and reconsider my
purpose in these threads in the first place. The whole purpose of this idea of
threads is to bring myself to be able to rewrite the whole of the novel in a
different order, or just extract the excerpts that have certain symbolism, or
certain other ideas. So in this way, the concept of annotations is a much more
useful one. However, then I run in to a different problem, and that is the
difference between a reference an actor in an event. So suppose I want to
extract every excerpt regarding Sauron. There are so many references to Sauron
throughout the LOTR, but he takes part in very few events. Pippen sees him in
the Palantir, as does Aragorn, but besides that he is only referenced by the
characters more than anything. Sauron is not the best example though, lets take
Gandalf. What I am getting at, if I want to find the path of Gandalf through
the Lord of the Rings, should that include the references to him? For instance,
I know surely (okay, not surely, but I'm pretty sure) that Frodo at least
thinks about him as he and Sam and Gollum travel there way to Mount Doom, but
the event "Frodo ties the elven rope around Gollum and it burns him" should not
contain Gandalf in it even if Frodo does make a mention to him. Gandalf is
being refernced, but that event would not be included in the path that Gandalf
takes through the lord of the Rings. However, Gandalf should definitely be
included as an annotation in that scene, and this is where my problem lies.
Indeed, perhaps this concept of thread is one of those concepts that nears the
mark, but needs to be re-imagined in a different way, similar to how clever
mathmeticians just simply have to think about a problem very hard in order to
solve it.

So I think at this point I have three concepts which encapsulate everything I
want to capture in my system. The first, and most specific, is that of the
speaker, which would be the lowest most base form of an excerpt. The second is
the idea of an event, which would be composed of multiple of these speakers,
and would have multiple actors. So the event, "Gandalf tells the council about
the betrayal of Saruman" would be an event, but "Saruman's betrayal" would not
be, since we never have dialog which tells about the betrayal of Saruman in
real time, only Gandalf's recollection of it. I'm not sure if Saruman would be
considered an actor in that event or not, I haven't decided yet. The last is
the concept of character reference, and I think the best way to reconcile this
would be to have a list of tags that the system looks for for a character. This
could be done in the form of [brackets] like this one. So in Harry Potter,
everytime "He who must not be named" is mentioned, I could put [Voldemort] in
brackets next to the name. It would be implied that the brackets are added by
me. To find all of these references, the use of regular expressions would be
used to scrape the raw data, and one could imagine a function that takes in the
regular expression input and returns every reference in the source (as the base
level of source), or returns every event that Voldemort is mentioned in, and
also every event that Voldemort is an actor in.

So every event would have a list of actors (and these actors need not even have
dialog, it could just be known that they were there) but every source has one
speaker. I'm not sure how unweildy this would get, trying to mark out every
time the speaker changes in my work, but it could be done. The events are what
are imposed into a tree like structure, and I find it neccesary to require that
leaves of events could be applied in non-sequential order. That is, I could
have an event like, "the gang discuss their plans" and "the villian creeps
closer to the gangs hideout", and in the case that the author wants to create
suspense by writting about the villian creeping closer to the hideout
interwoven in the dialog about the gang discuss their plans, I could still by
forcing some sub events be a part of the first parent event, and some sub
events being a part of the second parent event.

When it comes to thinking about these things, I think I have to take a top-down
(breadth first) approach to these events. So a first level event would be
something that spans the entire novel (Frodo's journey through middle earth vs
Aragorn's ascension to kingship), and each of these events would have their sub
events. This is the part where I am still having the hardest time imagining
what this is like in my head, as both of those bigger events would contain
overlaping sub-events, which is a concept I have not been able to capture in my
annotations and notes so far, so I'm still struggling with finding the best way
to represent this.

So after taking a bit of a walk on this, while I still haven't totally
reconciled how this will go in full, I have gotten quite a bit closer. I like
the idea of using brackets (which, when I acheive a certain level of
cleverness, I will be able to generate using vim scripts and autocompletion to
allow for easy night time reading) to represent speakers. Every source will
have a speaker. An event will be a list of sources. (Also note that I have the
freedom to break up one source by the same speaker as I see fit. This will
become helpful when someone goes on at length about something, and at the very
end of their monologue, they ask a question which fits in an entirely different
event. So I could annotate with brackets something like [speaker:Aloysha] for
his monologue, and then break up his monologue with [speaker:Aloysha] again
when the tone of his conversation changes as I deem appropiate). Once I have
these events, I then think that the best course of action will be to have a way
to combine events to this tree structure. I also want to have the notion that
one source can go into multiple events, and also the notion that one event can
go into multiple parent events as well.

With this concept well formed in my head, I think it will be best if I continue
to read Mistborn and break down that story in this way. That story is
complicated enough to warrent this sort of analysis but not so complicated that
I will get confused as to what I am doing and why.

# 20180702 Temptation of Marijuana, visit to my father, Commentary about the dragon and the king
So today I don't have much to say. I did have a dream last night, but it was
mostly uninteresting, since when I tried to go to sleep in one location, I had
my watch with the alarm for BJJ on it, but I could not go to sleep in that
location because I just couldn't, so I went into my bedroom but didn't take the
watch with me, so the dream was mostly about dreaming that it was a different
time than it was, and I actually woke up at 3 o'clock after my dream self had
convinced myself that it was past 7 o'clock. I knew as soon as I woke up that
it couldn't be 7, and I checked the time and it was indeed 3, so I did some
quick sleep math and determined I had two more sleep cycles, so I went back to
sleep and proceded to have a dream where I created an absurdly massive joint,
scraping off a bunch of weed (and dust) from a shelf onto a big sheet of
butcher paper, and the entire dream was so absurd that I didn't even smoke the
joint but just made it into two pieces and that was that. It was very strange,
and I honestly don't even know how to roll a joint so the entire thing was
quite absurd. I woke up knowing how absurd it was, so I am glad that at least I
didn't wake up thinking I had smoked some weed like I have in the past.

I will say I will be glad when this First Drug Offender Program gets started,
because at this point I still have temptations (not to the point of acting on
them, but to the point of amusing myself with them idly and subconciously as my
thought will drift) since I don't know when the first time I am going to have
to piss in a cup is, and it could very well be more than a month from now, at
which point I could smoke weed right now if it weren't for my own self enforced
probation. Obviously I am not going to, but I imagine that as long as my
thoughts are able to entertain the idea that I could do it and probably get
away with it, I will probably continue to have dreams like this, which is
unfortanate, but it is just how it is.

I visited my father on Sunday. He is doing a lot better than he was on
Thursday. His fever has gone down, his diarehha has gone down, and while he is
still certainly not anywhere close to recoverd from this thing, it seems like
the worst of it is over. The climax has been acheived and at this point it is
falling action. We didn't talk about much. I told him about our experince at
the Bavarian Grill, which he got a good kick out of, and we talked about other
things in between when the nurse was coming in and out and applying blood
transfusions. The most notable thing is, as I was approaching getting ready to
leave (and this is something that I will have to remember in the future, a sort
of trick for handling emotionally driven moments, to have them towards the end
of a conversation when arrangments require that one party leave at that
moment), he brought up our relationship, mentioning that as a child he was
always told to do things on his own, and he felt that he wanted to give us the
opposite, to do things for us, because he never anyone do anything for him.
Now, of course, I had thought about these things before, but never had I
thought about his reasoning for doing all of the things before, that it was
because he never had things done for him, and that he felt strongly that he
needed to provide that for us, and he mentioned the time he changed my spark
plugs without me there, and he said that he knew that it frosted me, and that
he didn't know it would frost me so. And he apologized for it, and as I was
driving away I thought about how I handled that moment. I could have handled it
a little better, but at the same time I didn't want to just say "I forgive you"
because that is too much like he is the only one at fault and I am applying my
forgivness as some hypocritical saint, so I said something like "well I have
known these things and thought about them, and though I knew them in my head I
was too bitter to be okay with them (or something equally unweildy) but I don't
fault you for it. You did a good job. You are doing a good job." and I was
speaking softly, so he didn't catch the last bit, and asked me to repeat it, so
I did. And then we shared our goodbyes I held his hand, which didn't have as
much strength as it has had before but still had some, and as I walked out I
said something like "I would tell you to keep getting better but I don't think
I have to tell you that" to which he replied that no indeed, I didn't have to
tell him that, and I made my leave. I don't recall if I said I love you (and
the fact that I can't recall that indicates to me that I didn't because I would
recall that if I did) and I remember thinking that I could have applied my
forgivness, or rather applied my past forgiveness again, to that situation a
little better, but still that I felt that it was a nice moment between us. Nice
moment indeed.

I also mentioned that lately, as this thing has been approaching it's climax, I
have felt a stronger inclination to visit, and that I'm not sure where it comes
from, but at the end there of our conversation I said that it eases my heart to
see him, and indeed it does ease my heart to see him, and I am glad that I said
that in that way. I thought about this, how it could be a selfish thing, and
again I go on about being selfish here, but I meant it in an entirely unselfish
way, and only just afterwards realized that it might be selfish, and so I can
say that it could in no way be meant as selfish. It is one of those things that
should only be said once though, I think for this very reason, because that
statement is in a since selfish, as if I am only visiting him to ease my own
heart, so I will not say it again, or at least I do not see myself seeing a
situation where it would be appropiate to say it again. Maybe such a situation
exists, but I can't forsee it so I think it is something that will be said once
and not again, at least not in relation to visiting him during this time.

I want to jump directly now to the short story that I have not brought myself
to finish yet. It is rather a peculiar thing, that I feel as though that I
should only write it when I feel so inspired, and that I shouldn't touch it
otherwise. Indeed, what would be the harm in writing for it, only to entirely
discard it and write it again when I feel so inspired? Would there be great
harm in writing a sub par draft of the ending of the story? I don't think so,
especially since I have a very sub par draft of the beginning of the story, and
a subpar draft of the ending would be only appropiate. I guess this comes to
the point of making my writing speak in volume rather than require there to be
consistent quality every time I sit to strike keys on the keyboard. Indeed, if
the concept of writing out some thousand words of a story that I am working on
become a routine ordeal, and the concept of constanly weeding through and
editing and finding structure in that which was written is one that I want to
make part of my writing, then I think for sure I should entirely dismiss this
idea of having my first draft be good, and instead simply sit down and write
for the story without concern for whether on not I will be satisfied with what
I write.

Still though, this particular story I have such a fondness for, as I
feel as though it is not my own story but instead entirely inspired by
something apart from me. Indeed, I don't know if I still have the original
recording, but I don't remember anything about the inspiration or motivation
for that original recording, and I have no idea where the idea came from. I can
only imagine being so high in my room, thinking about my nihilistic thoughts,
and coming up with this story to directly express them.

What I love about this story is that it has only three characters, the Dragon,
the King, and the People, each entirely different, each with different
motivations and motives and all of that, with different reasons for doing what
they do. In fact, this is the first story with characters that I have felt
don't neccesarrily fit into a mold like my other characters do (since I am very
much not a character person). The king is very much a part of me, but the
dragon and the people both represent ideas that are very much not a part of me.
Indeed, I don't empathize with the people, and I don't empathize with the
dragon. Instead, they are concepts, reflections, of what I think those
characters should be like.

At the point I am in the story right now I have just written up the ritual, and
I was interrupted (I had to go to yoga) at the point where the dragon was
summoned, and the people began to tell the dragon of their plight. I do not
believe I have written it yet, but I want the people to tell the dragon about
their problems, and for the dragon to insist on leading the people in the kings
place. I want this to be almost forced, I want there to be a sense of fear in
the people which is invoked, and I want the dragon to insist that this is the
way it must be. I have a line in my head "For what reason would you come all
the way to this pilgramage, to summon that which you have fear of and request
guidance from, if you are not to listen and obey when that has spoken?" I want
to liken this to some myth right now, but maybe I have been reading to much
epic poetry and should leave the references out of it.

# 20180703 Of my night, Dream of Crossfit, sleep paralysis, Dream of Marijuana and drug testing, discovery of my four characters for the hermit story
So I want to get this down before I forget it. This dream I had last night was
not too spectacular, but it is definitely worth writing down and setting off my
thoughts for this journal article with, as I feel there is definitely something
in it. Before I talk about the dream though, I want to say a little bit about
my night. So last night was what I would consider an ideal night. I went to bed
promptly after stuffing myself full of a turkey sandwich and a PBJ, along with
what must have been over a half a gallon of milk, before I laid down to rest
with my full stomach and my tablet. I woke up around four o'clock, which would
have been a good five cycles of sleep, all dreamless to my recollection. When I
woke, I got up and played the second part of the opus whatever it is of
Chopin's nocturnes in F minor and Eflat major, and I promptly decided that I
don't particularly care for this set and have elected to print out another to
occupy myself at the night like this. The second one is interesting, but I
don't have any emotion to it. I do find it neccesary to associate myself, or at
least become familiar with this sort of disconcordant harmony which I have
subconsciously stayed away from in the past simply due to the fact that it is
unfamiliar to me, but I quite like the sound of it when it is played well, and
I would like to familiarize myself with it so that I can better parse it and
understand it, so that my understanding of music as a whole will become more
enlightened as I continue on this path of neglecting my worldly
responsibilities in favor of indulgence in these fine arts. After I was
finished with that nocturne, I then went back towards the reading of the Grand
Inquisator of the Brother's Karamazov, and though I found it extremely lengthy
and unneccesarily archaic (at least the tranlsation by Garnett is so), it had a
cool little punch at the end, I liked the climax, even though I knew how it
was, but mostly I like where it fits in the story, rising tension happening
everywhere, and even so our characters are able to discuss this matter of
philosophy as if it is more important than all of the rising action that is
going on up to this point. Quite interesting indeed, if not a little pompous,
but the author makes note of this pompousness quite explictly, so it can be
excused as it is excused by the author himself.

But all of this has nothing to do with the dream I had that followed. Like most
of my dreams, I don't remember much of this one except that it had to do with
Crossfit. This Crossfit setting is different than the ones I've had in the
past. This one was a rather small gym, one story on the surface level (not the
one with the basement that I usually associate with Crossfit competition) with
one opening that faces west. And the fact that it faces west I know to be true,
or at least, I know that the direction the opening faces I strongly associate
with Left. This gym is much smaller than the big with with the pullup rig that
goes all around it in a square with two openings, this one is shaped rather in
two sort of rectangle areas, each connected, the northern one being more like a
square, and the southern one being more like a rectangle. And in the square
area, as will become relevent in the dream, there are two sets of pull up
rigs, one that is more reachable, and another that one would have to climb up
in some way to get to. However, the person on the upper pull up rig in the
dream is simply up there, and I did not think of how he got up there or how I
or anyone would get up there in order to use it, rather it was just a feature
of the gym that you could get up there and that it was completely normal. What
I remember about this gym is walking in, and talking with the owner. How I knew
he was the owner, I don't know, but he was and I knew it because it was a dream
and you just know these sorts of things in dreams. I don't remember the
conversation I had with the owner, but I do remember that it mostly involved me
asking him some questions, questions about his gym and such, and that the
nature of these questions was that I was asking him as if quizing him, not
because I had questions that I wanted answered for myself, but because I wanted
the answers from him so I could learn his answers. These are the sorts of
questions that I would ask (and have asked) Crossfit box owners about their box
in order to size them up. I then transitioned to talking about the workout we
would do for the day, to which he defered me to one of the others in the gym. I
must remind you that this gym was quite small, so while we were talking in the
southern part of the gym, there were two others who were working out in the
northern part, and the four of us brought the gym to its highest comfortable
capacity. Surely there could have been more in the gym to work out, but any
more than the four of us would have made the gym feel croweded. So I take a few
steps over to the other section of the gym, and I ask one of them what the
workout of the day is. The two people were already in the act of working out,
but not "doing a workout" or "WOD" as crossfiters would say, but instead doing
working sets and resting in between. So the person on the lower set of the
pullup rig, who was in between sets, begins to describe to me the workout that
they are doing, and the first thing he says is that it involves ninety pullups.
At this I inturupt him, saying that I am meant to do ninety pullup per round?
in a questioning way, because I knew this was supposed to be a very metcony
workout, and I knew that though I would be able to complete whatever workout
they threw my way, I also knew that ninety pullups per round would work much
more of a muscular endurance aspect of the movement rather than the breathing
heavy aspect, so I asked him something like "really, ninety pullups per round
or do you mean something else?" And then he replied something like, "well yeah,
we do things seriously here." which didn't answer my question at all, and I
immediately dismissed him as a foolish meathead who only concerned himself with
big numbers and used that to determine the quality of his workouts. The person
on the higher pull up rig, who was on top of it, who had overheard our
conversation (and how could he not, he was right there), then replies that no,
it's not ninety pullups per round, but instead nine pullups at the start of
each round, making a total of ninety. I then thanked him, and entirely
dismissed the first athelete, and focused my attention on this other one,
saying, "Okay, so describe to me the workout, it is 10 rounds of nine
pullups..." and I left the statement hanging there as if he were to finish it,
but then he did not. Now, I cannot remember if he went back to his workout, but
I think what happened is they both became a touch confused the first one more
so and the one on the rig I think more amused than anything, and this was near
the end of the dream, so I never got what the other movements of this workout
were meant to be, and I certainly didn't get to the point where I was ready to
start it. And that is where the dream ended.

I also find it pertinant to say that I did have some sleep paralysis at some
point in the night as well. I don't remember at what point in the timeline of
the night I had this paralysis, but it was accopanied by hallucinations again,
which now that I am aware that I do indeed hallucinate during my sleep
paralysis, I am made aware of the fact that the people I am imagining coming
into my room are not real, and I was able to rest easier and almost enjoy the
feeling of paralysis. Yes, enjoy is the word I would use. And in order to
justify my use of that word I should say a bit about yesterday.

Yesterday was a rough day for me. Currently I have been assigned a programming
case which I am not quite sure at all what to do with, and instead of working
on it I continued to work on learning Russian (which I think I have finally
narrowed in on a couple of primary resources I want to use, as well formulated
my conception of how I want to help myself learn vocabulary, so the hours I
spent yesterday, though they felt in vain a bit, were acutally quite fruitful
in my whole endeavor) and writing the story of the King and the Dragon, and
doing all sorts of other unproductive things, unproductive in relation to my
work at least, and I began to feel quite guilty of it all. That, coupled with
the empty stomach (I had not eaten enough the night before) and the feeling of
tiredness (which I blamed on the fact that the people of Alliant take great
concern in me taking a twenty minute nap during the afternoon, which I can
understand their jealousy of, but we would all be better off if we could take
such naps) led to a rather shitty late afternoon, which was only redeemed what
I was able to steal a nap during the spine strengthening series of Bikram Yoga
which I dread so much. I really hate the poses involved in the spine
strengthening series, I think they are silly and dumb and I don't like them,
which they would say indicates that they are the poses that I need the most,
but I disagree, saying instead that I would much rather work shoulder related
poses in that time as my shoulders need so much more opening than my spine
needs strengthening, and the soreness I feel in my back come entirely from that
god-awful series. I digress. The point is that I had a rough day yesterday, and
in reflection of that day I determined that it was mostly caused by lack of
sleep and lack of food, both of which are things that are in my control and
both of which are things that I neglected the night before, the food much more
so than the sleep as, though I know certain things that hinder sleep, I don't
have quite as much control over that aspect than I do the ability to jam food
in my mouth.

And that is why I say I could enjoy the sleep paralysis. Once I knew the
hallucinations, I was able to determine, by looking at my door, that indeed it
was shut, and the going in and out of my room that I thought I heard was indeed
hallucination. Indeed, if I describe the hallucinations as if I thought they
were real, I thought that what I saw was someone entering and exiting my
apartment, I heard the door opening and closing (and since I forget at what
point in the night these hallucinations happened, it is plausible, though I
think not likely that these door sounds could have been real), and I heard
speaking, as if there were someone talking to someone else as one worker would
talk to another about the work they are doing, and I thought I even saw the
figure of someone over my box which I am sleeping behind right now. However, I
was able to look over to the corner of my door, and I saw that the sound of the
door opening and closing was not accompanied by my door actually opening and
closing, so using this I was able to determine that the hallucinations were not
real and I was able to let myself rest there more soundly. In fact, I at that
point attempted to embrace the feeling of paralysis, because even though I know
the ways to bring myself out of the paralysis when it happens (focusing on the
breath is the biggest one, and ensuring that it goes in and out in deep full
breaths) I knew that the paralysis was a good thing. I knew that it wasn't time
to wake up and that I wanted to continue to sleep, so I embraced the paralysis,
and was glad in it. And that feeling of paralysis suddenly felt pleasurable. It
was the kind of pleasure one feels on the toungue when you place a tasty bit of
food on it, but instead of simply feeling it on the tongue I felt it throughout
my entire being (since the body is paralyzed, the concept of feeling a
sensation at a certain part of the body is gone entirely, so that all of your
sensation is the sensation of your being rather than the sensation of any
particular nerve). This sensation was not pleasure, in the traditional sense,
like one might think of orgasm though, instead this was the feeling one gets
when you lay in your bed and you know you should get up, but you don't, except
instead of having the ability to get up and feeling all of your limbs be heavy,
you don't feel heavy limbs but instead feel as though you are just a spirit in
space. This feeling can be very scary, especially if you try and resist it and
attempt to move your limbs (which I remind you are paralyzed), but once I was
able to accept it and realized that it was the feeling that I wanted to
embrace, I was able to embrace it, and then I returned to sleep.

I feel very compelled now to write about the dream I had. This dream was very
vivid and involved the consumption of Marijuana and the subsequent drug testing
that would happen, along with alot of other symbolism involving my mom, the
setting and other things, that I do truly have to write about it. This dream
happened after a nap occuring on July the third, after we were dismissed early
from work, and I decided to lay my head down despite the fact that I knew I had
signed up for Bikram yoga that day at 5. This dream actually occured
immediately after I had woken up at five o'clock almost precisely, and saw that
I would indeed be missing my Bikram yoga class for the day.

This dream began in a house that was almost exactly like the Franda's, a dream
location that I know I have had before, and which truely was the spitting image
of the Franda's old house from my childhood. In this location, on the stove,
there was a bit of Marijuana, and for some reason, which I had reciprocated
with my mom, who agreed, I had determined that it was required for me to take a
hit of marijuana, and subsequently get drug tested immediately following, in
order to mark the beginning of the process which I have literally just today
signed on to. So in the dream I had rolled up a joint (in these dreams it is
always a joint even though as I've said before I don't know how to roll a joint
in real life and the joint is very much not my prefered methode of consumption)
at the stove of the Franda's, and I took a sort of ritualistic hit, savoring it
as a convict on death row might savor his last meal (that analogy is mine in
this moment, I wasn't thinking about death row in the dream, but I simply
wanted to emphasize that I savored it as a man condemned might savor something)
before proceeding to talk to my mom about what needs to be done. I discussed
with her the plan, and after I had taken the hit, I came to her, or she to me,
in that place of the Franda's, and talked about what needed to be done. I gave
her the paperwork, and we went together to the place where I was to get tested.
Now, this place, which was just down the road from the Franda's place where the
dream started, we were able to walk to, and I know I have been to this place
before in my dreams, although I forget in what context this dream location
exists, but it's description I will describe now. In the bottom floor, you walk
in from the corner, and the first thing you see straight ahead is door to an
inner stairwell which leads to the upstairs area, which when you are in the
upstairs area is not really upstairs, but to the left and right of this stair
well entrance, coming at ninety degrees from the corner through which you walk,
is a big open area, one could imagine being in an airport or stadium or
something else that has this area, and to the left there is a laser tag
section, which I have had dreams about before, and to the right, I'm not sure.
This area reminds me very greatly of some other dream locations which are
appearing to me as a write this almost against my will, as I try and imagine
which dream area this one truely was, I have all these other dream locations
appearing in my mind, so this location must have some sort of significance to
me. Regardless, we, me and my mom, looked around this area, left and then
right, before deciding that up was the direction we needed to go. And I want to
mention at this point as well that this place was a place intended for
children, that this establishment was created for the amusement of children,
similar to Chuck E Cheese or similar, but for slightly older children, and as
we went up this stairwell, which the stairwell itself had this sort of
steampunk back alley feel to it, as if the walls and floors hadn't been cleaned
in years, we made it to the up stairs area. Now this upstairs area, as you walk
up into it, had this peculiar feature. There was a sort of walkway, where as
you come up the stairs (there was no exit door to the stairs, even though there
should have been) on your left is a wall that comes up to about chest height,
which when you get high enough on the stairs you can easily see over into the
room to the left, and this wall goes on from the top of the stairs a good way,
maybe three or four yards, until you get to the top right-most of the room,
which has a doorway into the "employees only" area of the room. Upon coming to
this sort of walkway, I look to the left to see many children in roller skates
going around on this roller rink, as this upstairs area is a roller rink, and
the wall that you can look over marks the edge of the rink. Evenutually the
wall comes down, to the floor where the rink meets the walkway, indicating the
perimeter of the rink, and the entire place was dark except for one opening
that was past the walkway beyond the chest high wallway where it is open and
leads to somewhere with light. I want to talk about this place with light for a
moment, because it does not simply lead outside, but it leads to another
portion of the dream area which surely must represent something else to me,
but I don't know what in this moment, and I don't know if I have ever been
there before, but I see in my head right now a sort of air hanger area, a
garage sort of space, where you could imagine that airplanes are kept, antique
single passengers airplanes, but this area does not come up again in the dream.
I don't know why this area feels significant to me, but it does. Regardless,
when we reach the top of the staircase, we are greeted by a man, clearly a
young kid no older than me or at the very most my age who works there, and
seeing this peculiar thing of a grown man walking up these stairs with his mom
to this place clearly intended for children, he inquires if he can help us. I
take a breif glance to my mom, who gives me the gesture to take care of this as
an adult would, and I speak to him and request in that moment, to be
administered a drug test. Actually I asked first if they administer drug tests,
but I didn't wait for the answer and simply then requested to be admistered
one. He asks me for my paperwork, which I remember pulling out of my pocket,
and looking to my mom as if to ask in one moment of eye-contact "this is
correct right?" to which she nods. After procuring the paper-work, he then asks
me, "and this drug test is meant to return clean is it not?" to which I at
first say yes, of course, but then remember that I had taken a hit of the
joint, and at that moment the reason for taking that hit escapes me, and for
the first time in the dream I start to realize that maybe the reason I took the
hit was illegitament, and that I just come up with it as an excuse to take a
hit, but I then thought that that, also, was an absurd thought, and that I had
distinctly remembered being against taking the hit at first but indeed did have
very legitamte reason for doing so, but that reason was escaping me. I tried to
explain this to the worker there, who looked at me with a sort of guilty
glance, as if he knew that I was full of shit, and I remember asking to call my
attorney after the test had been done, or I actually asked my mom to call the
attorney, because she didn't know the reason for my taking the hit. Eventually,
after the judgemental (that's the word!) glance from the attendent there lasted
a bit, I remember asking to be adminstered the test anyway, and to let it come
back positive and that I knew that that was the plan, although I was second
guessing myself the entire time. The attendendent, still with his judgemental
look on his face, takes me through the employees only area at the back right of
the room from the stairs, and in this area is a kitchen area, much closed off
from the rink area and much more enclosed and almost even claustrophobic, and
in this kitchen area is an employees only bathroom which I am led into. This
bathroom was a single person restroom, and was quite unkept, being very dirty
and rusty as a neglected outdoors camping restroom might be, and in this place
I took all of things I had in my hand and put them on the sink which was there
next to the toilet, and I found the cup I was meant to pee into. In all of
those things I also saw my phone, which I thought about the illigatamcy of the
whole thing (as if I could somehow produce clean piss from my phone) and
thought about using it to get the reason for taking the hit from my attorney,
but I knew my mom was calling him so I didn't. So at this point we are nearing
the end of the dream, as I took the cup, and also this device which looked like
a pregnancy test, and I started peeing into the cup, and interjected this other
testing device between the stream and the cup, and immediately the device
showed a blue line indicating that the urine was not clean (which I had for
some reason thought it wouldn't even though I had just smoked weed earlier in
the dream), and I began to go into a sort of calm panic, if that makes sense,
knowing that panicing wasn't worthwhile in that situation, but not having any
other sensible thing to do. After doing this, for some reason to complete the
task I had to apply a sort of sticker to the underside of my penis, which had
become incredibly erect all of a sudden, as if it had been erect the whole time
and I hadn't realized it, and I heard my mom outside talking with the
administer of the test, speaking about just how clean I had been the past days,
knowing it to be true, and also talking about how I had given up masterbation
as well, and how she was so impressed by it, and that he must have had a good
reason to smoke the marijuana because he has been otherwise extremely faithful
to staying clean. So as I am applying this sticker thing to my extremely erect
(and to go into detail, very veiny and almost even the texture of glass, as I
thought about how it resemebles the pipe that I like to smoke out of, and as I
thought this the veins started to resemeble strongly the artistic markings on
my pipe, and though I have made the pipe/penis analog in my head before, who
hasn't, I had not made the analogy of the veins to the decorative marking
before), as I am applying this sticker, and listening to my mom talk so highly
of me, I felt as though somehow everything would be okay. I thought about how I
did not have even the slightest compulsion to stroke that large penis to orgasm
so as to lower it, but instead I just let it be entirely erect and did nothing
to try and prevent it. So I applied this sticker to the underside of my erect
penis, and closed up the cup and put all of the things aside, and that was the
end of the dream. The dream ended before I knew anything about what would
happen as a result of that test.

I will remark that I did have a bit of wood as I woke up, (although not nearly
as much as the dream would have indicated, just a slight chubby that went down
rather quickly after waking) and that this was one of those times where I had
to gather myself and remind myself that I had not in actuality smoked anything,
and I want to say that I felt rather dehydrated and "numb" in a way that I
sometimes do when I take naps of this single REM length. Indeed, when I woke I
found the length of the sleep to be exactly one sleep cycle, as I woke at 6:35,
which would mark out exactly one full cycle of REM sleep. I then lay there,
deciding to wake up, and I have been writing ever since, which has taken just
under an hour to do.

I could have dismissed this dream a simply another marijuana dream, but there
seems to be something more here, the images of unclean area, the judgmental
(and now that I think about it probably hypocritical) look on the attendents
face, and the fact that my mom is there, and that she knows about my giving up
masterbation (I have told her about this before and we have had discussions
about it), and the peculiar erection that I had towards the end, all point to
something, but I can't put all the peices of it together, but I can only leave
it as it is so that one day maybe I'll read it back and still not know what it
all means but instead will simply just live with it being there. The dependance
on my mother is what troubles me the most, similar to a past dream I have
written about, where it is simply there, and as much as I don't want to label
it or assign it anything, I can only think that I dislike that aspect of my
subconscious, and it gives me curiosity as to when that aspect might go away. I
don't know.

At this moment, now, I have a compulsion to write. Indeed, there is this story
that I have thought of, that I haven't had the time to discover yet, but I
think it is time to discover it.

Inside of me, there are four characters. Each of these characters falls on a
different end of a two by two square, the sorts of two by two squares that are
a part of any good ted talk, the kind of two by two square that always aims to
oversimplify something so as to make it understandable to the most stupid of
audiences, stupid in the sense that even though the individuals in that
audience may each be intellgent, the intersection of the intellegence of the
whole of the group could be said to have the IQ of only the most dull of farm
animals. The sort of stupidity that smart people will see be able to apply to
their own intelligence in an intellegent way, but when taken on its own and
analyzed as it's own work is taken as nothing but a gross oversimplifaction of
a vast and varied topic that scholars of many ages have wrestled with through
debate across grand scenes with wide implications on the thought and cultures
of our people.

My square is thus: on one dimension, we have the belief in Christianity, in
God, the God of the bible, and on the other dimension, we have dogmatism in
belief. So you can see the four extremes of these two spectrums. On the one
extreme end, we have the dogmatic Christian, believing in Christianity wholely
and completely, taking part in rituals of faith. On the other extreme end, we
have the dogmatic Atheist, in all his grossness of oversimplifications. Next,
we have the concept of the accepting Christian, similar to say Grant or Tim in
my own life, and then we have the character most representing myself, the
skeptical agnostic, seeing the reasonablness of everything and taking as few
axioms from the world as he can.

In my work, I will make no attempt to glorify the character representing
myself. In fact, I would very much like the reasonable Christian to be the
focus of the work, and have him be the protagonist in the story.

How these four become friends, I do not know yet. What brings them together?
What is the thing that makes these four inteact? It must be something wholly
unrelated to Christianity, some worldly pursuit that they all share. Maybe they
all play on the same sports team? I think for this story to work, it must be
written like a novel, similar to something like Anna Karenina, where the
characters each have their own affairs and their own dealings, and I need to be
able to explore each of them as individuals, and in pairs, and all together, in
order to get the whole of my work written in adequete fashion.

What is the setting of my story? I have failed to mention a fifth character,
the fifth cardinal direction, of a man, a hermit, taken as a spiritual figure,
who dies at the time of the characters, and found are his notes, his tomes, at
first scattered, but later compiled and put together. These writings will be of
my mythology. And at this point it is important to lay out the mythology of the
story. I want this man to tell his mythology in dreams, and in visions. I want
the mythology to be revealed through the lens of this hermit. I also want to
very much explore the mind of the hermit. I want there to be articles written
by him which are simply idle musings by him, where he questions his own visions
and questions his motivations for hermitage. I need to seclude myself for some
time in order to truly acheive this effect. When will that happen? I don't
know. If I am to marry and have children, I don't know when that might occur.
But I hope for my sake that it does.

I don't know what will be my mythology. So far I have several disconnected
stories, and I hope that through my dreams and my sparks of ideas that I have
and write into this journal that I can come up with an adequeate mythology. So
far I have the story of the King and the Dragon, but that is more of a tale
than a mythology. The dragon and the King would fit more in the history of my
world, similar to how Tolkien's middle earth is really an alternate history of
our earth, rather than a part of the mythology. But still, I need a mythology
as well.

How this mythology interacts with our real world, I am still not sure yet. I
want it to be through prophets and such, but I want the prophets to be
unreliable. I don't want there to ever be a sense of these people knowing for
certian the mythology. However, I want their stories to verify eachother
independently. This is difficult to do without making their stories self
fullfilling. In fact, that could be a crucial aspect of the whole thing as
well, including prophets who are found to be false. I also want to include real
prophets from our time, your David's and your Isaiah's and Mohammeds and such.
I want these prophets to be used more as reference though, I want the prophets
in my story to reference these and perhaps be aware of them, but I don't want
them to actually be a part of the mythology.

All of this is so mixed up in my head as to what I want. So far the only
original creation that I have is the character of Fice, who is a sort of
Devil's accomplice, as well as the original idea of the headless angels, those
that lose their way and impale themselves in order to gain their flight again.
Both of these concepts are very much concepts conceived of by my college self,
and I think that I have to let go of them because I didn't write about them
when I was in college, and those concepts and ideas are not so dear to me now
as others are.

I have a very strong inclination to talk about injustice, especially due to the
recent events of my life, the events being my dad's diagnosis of Lukemia as
well as my being charged with a felony. The adjudicator is a member of this
mythology.

# 20180704 Dream of Kim in Seattle - Discovery of the hermit
So I woke up today thinking only about how much I didn't want to go to yoga. I
would so much rather sit here and describe my dream. So that's what I'm doing.

So this dream starts at the parking lot of this sort of crowded ocean location.
Or at least, I'm pretty sure it's the ocean, although thinking on it, the water
is much too still to be the ocean and it is probably a really big lake. If I
had to give a location for this whole thing, it would probably be the sister
city of my dream location of Seattle, so I suppose this is dream Portland. It
only makes logical sense. Anyway, I would like to spend a few words describing
the location. So as I said, this location is a massive lake, so massive that I
didn't even think to look out to the other side and see if it were possible to
swim across, and having woken up now, as I said, my first inclination was that
this was the ocean, but thinking about it, and thinking about exploring the
location in my mind, I know in my mind that if I were to get in a boat and
travel across it, I would certainly reach the other side, and I could go around
in a circle and go along the perimeter of this lake, so it is indeed a lake,
just a rather large one. That, and I know for certain that it is fresh water
rather than saltwater, and that the water is relatively still. So at the sort
of "popular entry point" to this lake is a parking lot, a rather small one for
the number of people that were here, but such things don't have to make sense
in this context. Somehow these people are all here, all of which are visiting,
and all of which somehow made it there without needing a spot to park. The
wonders of dream logic. From this parking lot, there is a sort of floating
bridge. If you can imagine the floating docks that you see at certain places,
that rise and fall with the tides, this place had many of these sort of
floating docks like this, but they were all connected in a wide web of piers
and bridges, all of which connected off of this one parking lot location. I
also do know, similarly to how I know that this body of water is a lake, that
there are other connecting locations for this dock network, and when I say
other connecting locations, I mean just one other, now that I think about it.
So this whole dock network, which is actually more solid than these floating
docks now that I think about it, has many different nodes and areas, some
covered, some not, all of which are different and unique in their own way, and
all of which are connected by these bridges in their own way. One can imagine a
children's playground, the sort of playground with a few circular areas, barred
off, with little children bridges between them, but all adult sized, and most
of them meant for adults to come to and lounge at and fish from. Because that
was what a lot of people were doing in the dream, not only the people who I
know in the dream, but just a lot of people, were fishing from these location
where it was appropaite. So the scene having been described, that is honestly
most of what the dream is. The dream starts with me parking my car in this
parking lot. I do want to mention that this is very much another dream I have
had of me living in my car. I was living in my car in this dream. And I don't
know when this first event happened, if it happened while I was in the car,
before the dream started, or if I farted a little too vulptuously in the dream
itself, but for a vast majority of the dream, perhaps even the entire dream, I
had come to this place for leisure, but the entire time I was looking for a
restroom, because in the dream, either before or during like I said I don't
remember, I had farted, but instead of a fart it had a little bit of poo in it,
and the entire dream I was attempting to find a restroom to take care of the
mess I made. Now, I am very much reminded of the time in Seattle that this did
indeed happen to me, but in Seattle when it happened, I immediatly (like a
thinking and reasoning human being would) checked myself, realized I had shit
in my pants (not a lot mind you, but enough that the term "I had shit in my
pants" is a reasonable thing to say), and took off the underwear I was wearing,
wiped myself breifly with the clean part of it so as not to spoil anything else
in the car, put on new underwear, and promptly threw the soiled underwear in
the nearest dumpster. I was a bit embarrassed by the event, but I knew that it
would all be okay, and that I was the only one who knew anything about the
whole thing, so I didn't concern myself with it. However, this dream was not
like this, for some reason I had determined that I needed to find some sort of
restroom in order to right this situation, and the entire dream was spent going
from person to person, being as cordial to them as I could while still finding
my way to a place where I could take care of my situation. So as I step onto
this pier web structure (because the whole point was to enjoy the scenes and
the view, which unfortanatly as you will find, I woke up before I could do
that) I step on and go along the first part of the bridge. At first it is
uncovered, but after a few dozen steps you go to a covered area, and this
covered area also has a wall at the back, towards the left side when you enter
it, and it comes to a sort of semi-circle area, which is wider than the bridge,
and could be said to be the first stopping point on this network of bridges. As
I get to the covered point, I had a sort of out of body dream experience, where
I took the point of view of a diver watching the fish take the bait, and I
overheard too people talking in this dream about thier fishing experience,
which is what prompted the out of body moment. I heard them talking about how
one of them caught a shark, and as he described it I could see the shark
grabbing thier bait and hooking on their line, but the shark had been eaten by
a whale, and as I heard him say that I could see the whale devour the shark in
a whole bite, the shark being one of those smaller sharks (although still quite
large) and the whale being of larger size then the shark, large enough for the
whole of the shark to fit in it's belly with minimal chewing, and mostly just
swallowing. Indeed, it would be appropiate to say that the whale swallowed the
shark. Having witnessed this scene from under the water first hand, my breif
out of body experience returned to my body, and I saw the fisherman holding his
pole with all his might, struggling to reel it in, with the tip of the pole
bending in every way, as he wrestled trying to pull the whale in, and he was
wholly dissapointed because he wanted to catch the shark, but he wanted to
salvage his pole now at this point, so he was forced to struggle to reel in the
whale. I then left these fisherman to their task, and continued along the way,
and as I continued along, I saw under this covered area and stopping at the
first sort of stopping point, were Kyle, Mom, and Evan, fishing in the center
with my Dad. The four of them all were there, but Kyle and Mom and Evan only
took notice of me and kept to whatever task they were doing (I don't think they
were all fishing, I know Kyle and Dad were, but I don't know about Mom and
Evan, and I am honesly not even sure thinking on it if they were a part of this
dream at all), but dad stopped me, and wanted to talk with me. What we talked
about, I don't remember, I only remember him holding his pole there, as he was
inbetween casts, and I sat down on the edge so as to conceal my uncomfortable
poop situation from my father as much as possible. After a somewhat breif
conversation that I was not listening to and only making the slightest replies
of, I mentioned that I wanted to go, and my dad let me go, but not before
making a remark to my smell, saying something like "you smell awful. What is
that?" to which I said I have no fucking clue and I got up and left, thinking
only about continuing on this path and looking past it towards a bathroom. And
after examination of the rest of this network beyond this first stop, I saw
multiple "nodes" on this network which were covered fishing nodes, each one
unique in its design and construction, even the bridges between them being
unique also, and I saw a place designed as a restroom a few nodes away. So I
begin making my way towards that direction, but I have to stop at another node
there as well, and as I come up to this node, this one being a sort of circular
node that was covered but was open in all direction except for the bridges that
connected to it, (which both connected to it in one corner of the circle, and I
know circles don't have corners but I mean corner in the sense that only a
small arc of this circle contained the bridges that connected to it and the
rest was open out, not entirely to open water as it faced more of the network,
but to a sort of openening in the network that gave access to a good chunk of
water), and when I came to this node, I examined the family that was fishing on
it to determine that it was Chuck and Michelle and Jessica and Chase. The only
people concerned my coming up to this node were Chuck, who was sitting in the
center of the node on top of what I somehow knew was an expensive ice chest,
and Michelle, who glanced over her shoulder and made an amicable gesture to me.
I stopped there and talked with Chuck for a bit, but not about anything that I
remember but instead just simply a short conversation, and I do remember
Michelle making more than an amicable gesture now that I think about it, but
she offered to give a spot for me if I wanted to join them. I respectfully
declined, and said that I was there more to explore, and I actually inquired to
them that I was looking for a restroom, and I wanted to confirm that the node I
was looking at was indeed a restroom. They replied that yeah, it was, almost in
a sort of way that said, "But why would you want to go there?" but they gave
their confirmation none-the-less, and thanked them and made my way over. As I
walked over there, I looked out to more bridges and more nodes, and at this
point I was getting to the point where I was approaching sort of the far edge
of this network of bridges from my parking location, but not entirely the far
edge, but still I knew I was about as far out as it would get from the parking
location, and I came up close to this outhouse. Now the way this outhouse was
designed, it was an open area, about chest high, with a door on the far end
that I was approaching it, and as I made it there, there was one person there,
I'm not sure if he was waiting for it of if he had just used it, but I felt
comfortable that I could go around him and use this toilet/outhouse area as no
one was using it and he was making no moves to enter it himself. And about the
time I was about to enter it (I didn't even see it in the dream, so I can't
describe what it looked like) I woke up.

Now I do want to say, when I woke up, I had to check myself a bit. I was
wearing loose sweat pants, my pants that have vegas and dice printed on them,
and I did a quick check to make sure they weren't soiled. I have not even to
this point used the restroom, not even to pee now that I think on it, but I do
have to poop a little bit, but not near so much as to warrent this dream.
Rather, I think it represents something, rather than an inclination to need to
poop, but instead it represents my apprehension to engage with others at the
embarrasment of the actions I have made. Indeed, shitting myself is a sort of
metephor that has been used by others to say when someone has fucked up. "He
really shit himself this time" and I think I understand after this dream that
the actual act of shitting myself in the dream came before my realization of
teh phrase, and I only just now remembered the phrase. It could represent my
choices to neglect my work, and in that way I have shit myself, and that is on
my mind, I know, so that could be the source of the dream, but I find it
strange that the main characters of the dream, and the ones I'm most embarresed
to make contact with, are my family and extended family, so I think it might be
a little deeper than this one case that I am failing to work on at work. But I
don't know.

Of the Father of Man

When they had gone through the hermitage, and found all of the belongings of
this man, let it be remembered and kept, the account of the mans notions and
visions of this world that he claims to have found, to have understood as the
real. The truth in these words I leave it to the reader to decide for himself,
for there are many things that some claim to be true, and must be navigated
carefully, but their truth is not always in fact but in their life. So this is
the life of the Father of Man, and the telling of it by the prophet. And so it
begins.

Of the beginning of everything, I wish to tell. Of the nature of man, and of
that which bore into him, which fled into his soul and gave him life, I must
tell of everything, for in this everything else is born. Yes, even God, and
Jesus, and the Devil, these beings, these spirits, these Divine Souls, yes even
Zeus and Hades, and Allah and Yahweh, and so many more that people do not know
about or have not even found to write about, I have seen them all. All, and
one, all from one, they have come. From this One, this way, I wish to speak. In
the beginning of all things, I begin my ramblings.

Oh, who am I, but a simple man of flesh, to have seen these things. To have
seen those spirits of the world where Chaos becomes Stillness, and Death
becomes Life, this upside-down place where no man is meant to go, this place
where time travels not forward or backward or even sideways, this place that
only the most wise and most in-tune of us get to visit. How blessed am I to
have seen it, but how wise I am to know that words will ever and always fail to
describe it in it's glory and justice. For what is this world if not the
embodiment of our ownselves? Indeed, I tell you that all of us, every one of
us, can see it and go there, but so many, only woefully too many of those with
feet that step upon the Earth, the mighty and terrible earth, will seek this
land and even see just a glimpse of it. Is it divine intervention? No, it is
mortal intervention, intervention of the soul, yearning to see that which makes
up the fabric of our existance. I have seen it, I have seen it only through the
lens of my blurred and immortal soul, and how inadequate my soul is to even
begin to attempt to describe this world to others. I tell you, I implore you,
this world cannot be described, it can only be visited. It can be visited by
every soul that has the ability to look into itself and find the world, the
way, the Eternal Way, that which goes beyond this world and into the next. No,
not the next, that is not the word, but the Other. The other. That is the
world. I have been there, and I only pray that my words allow others to go
there with their wisdom, with their soul, for I tell you that all of our souls
are the same, and what is seen in my soul, I that have been blessed with the
clarity of internal sight, who have been blessed with minimal influence of the
outer world, I have been able to see the world of the inner, in it's glory,
it's brightness, it's harmony and discordance of melody, but my vision is only
ever necceisarly imperfect, it is only from one angle that I see this world,
and each of us has our own angle, our own lens, with which we can view this
world, and we can only hope that by each of us sharing this world, and seeing
it, and letting our soul reveal itself to ourselves without intervention, it is
only be seeing this for ourselves, and then later, after seeing it through the
death of the ego and comparing accounts that we will be able to begin to
understand that which goes beyond our human thought. Yes, it is beyond
mortality, but even if this world is greater than any one of us, and perhaps
even all of us as humans, for I tell you everything, everything in this worldly
existance has it's own glimpse, it is only be becoming in tune with this
everything, the everything that is and that speaks to us in our sense, it is
only by touching as many of this everything that we can that we are able to
take glory and wisdom in what is only a fleeting knowledge of that which ties
it all together and weaves it all. And so I share my account, my imperfect,
blurred account that only comes from the angle of one soul, so that others may
see it from their angle and add to it, as we have done and have been doing for
millenia.

Oh, muses of Homer and Virgil, of Dante and Milton, yes, even the muses of
Newton and Einstein, muses of written thought and spoken word, of intellgent
sceintific speech and glorious prose and even the muses of Ceasar or Hitler,
muses of Isaiah or Mohammed or Ghandi or Buddha, those muses who inspire all to
try and bring their perfect vision of this other world into this imperfect one
and as such always neccesarily hit off the mark but always seek to illuminate
that which exists apart from us, oh glorious Muse, guide my words so that I may
bring my vision of this other world also into the hands of man. Let my words
not be final, and let any who seek to give the final account of all be known to
be false in that way, but instead guide my pen as it glides along the page so
that I may speak in a tongue that aims to guide the souls of as many that see
this as possible. O muse, take part of my soul, take me from my fleshly
existance, trancende my ego out of this world so that I may speak clearly and
plainly, without judgement, without preconception. Guide me so that I can
reveal to all the nature of All, the nature of my visions, these visions that
bind us all, that bind everything. Take me O muse!

First I must speak on the nature of these gods. Yes, gods, not God, because God
is simply one amonst these gods. I feel it neccesary to arrive at new name for
the beings, the spirits, the otherworldly that I see, some name other than god
lest I become mistaken for some false prophet, some slanderer who attempts
merely to reitterate the mythologies which have sprung out of our history. But
without another appropiate name coming to mind, let me just simply call them
the gods of the otherworld.

Every feeling, every emotion, and every action by every person or thing (yes,
even thing, no matter how inanimate it may seem) can be told of in the context
of a god. These gods do not have physical bodies or manifistations in this
world as we may think of them, but rather they inhabit an area of the other. A
god, once born, never dies, but will only grow more or less, and this growth
will come about by the comings and goings of our world into theirs. Indeed,
there is no portal from this dimension into that, or any other such nonsense,
there is no physical place that we can visit to find this other; rather, we can
only visit in our mind, and experience what we know to be them.

At this point, you might ask who am I to talk of my thoughts and my visions as
if they are real? But that is the whole crux of my preface, of the false
prophets who seek to bend and force their vision to their own will so that they
might see it. But the true prophet, the prophet who has no attachments to the
physical and wishes only to see this other world as it truely is, without
seeking to distort or morph it into his own conception of what it should be,
this is the kind of prophet I seek to be, and it is only in my words that
another may judge me to be true or false. Indeed, I know for certain that my
visions must be false to some extent, as I must bend them in order to fit them
into the framework of language that we use to share, and of that neccesary
morphing I see no way around, as we all live in this flesh and of the flesh is
how we communicate. So I implore the reader, try and remove the flesh from my
words, and see the visions I see for yourself. Don't let my words impose upon
you the visions that I know you can see, but instead let them guide you and
inspire you to visit this realm for yourself, in truth, so that you may judge
my words for your own.

Indeed, it is because of this history, the history of the gods, that I must
preface my history of the gods so. For in the beginning, there was no god of
Judgement, there was no god of Retribution, or Violence, or even of Love or of
Peace. No, in the beginning, as far as my vision can tell, there was only the
god of Stillness. And I say that only in my vision, for my vision can only go
back so far, as there is no true beginning of these things. Indeed, to say
something about the beginning is absurd, it's a construction of the flesh to
try and make sense of that which we cannot understand. However, as far back as
can be seen by our only so finite souls, the first god of this world was
Stillness. Stillness is empty, it is the vessal through which all things are
filled. It is the Dao that could be talked about in Eastern Religion. It does
not hurt, it does not feel. It has no thoughts, and it has no motive. Indeed,
this god named Stillness is only a god so much in the sense that there must be
some god to describe this concept. This god, Stillness, is the god from which
Chaos is born. And truly I tell you, Chaos is born out of Stillness.

And in this way I must tell you more about the nature of these gods, and more
the nature of this "Other realm" we speak of. The best way I can describe this
realm is in music. When one closes the eyes and listens, not even to a symphony
as that has too much humanity in it, but when one listens to nature, to the
sounds around you, and takes them in without judging them, one can be
transported to a new realm. In this realm, you have no senses, no feeling of
touch or sight or sound, nothing but your own conscious floating in a dream. It
is in this realm that the gods are born. When one feels something move in this
realm, in this state of meditation, that feeling of something is the closest
thing we as mortals of the flesh have to understanding these otherworldly
beings. These beings inhabit us and take us, and most don't think on it or
realize it. It takes great meditative introspection to understand it, and most
refuse to acknowledge that. This is the closest thing we have to seeing these
gods.

But let me tell you, these gods are real. They are real in as much as the grass
you step on is real, or the chirping of the bird in the forest is real. As much
as the love one man can have for a woman is real, these gods are real. Every
feeling, every emotion, however false it may be, is inhabited by these very
real and ever harmonizing gods. You may think my words are not so, but believe
me when I say that the feelings in introspection that one feels can be felt
across the self, without the ego, and without the ego, these gods are only too
real, perhaps even more real than what we may usually consider to be real. What
I speak to you I speak of as my understading of the world, as reality as I
experience it. Do not take this lightly, it is real, and I implore you to
suspend your disbelief so that you can come to understand that with me as well.

And so these gods are born in this realm, and though they may grow and shrink,
they never die. One god can consume another and encapsulate it, but that
original god has not died but merely changed form, it has morphed,
Metaphorphasized as Ovid might say, into another form. And gods are always born
out of another, not through intercourse (as indeed, the concept of intercourse
is a much fleshly one indeed) but through a sort of godly intercourse, through
two gods coming together as one, they not only are able to create something, a
new god out of their union, but also they will lose a part of themselves in
doing so, and in this way, their broader nature is brought into greater
divisions. But this union is never taken lightly, it only comes out of
neccesity. There is no courtship amongst the gods, only the union of them as
the physical requires it. In our own actions, and the actions of all in this
fleshly world that takes place do these gods transform and become changed.

To the skeptics in my audience who might say sadonically, "Oh wise prophet, if
this other world exists, and exists in the same way our world exists today,
then what are it's rules? Does a body in motion stay in motion, and a body at
rest stay at rest in this other world?" To this I say, the point is missed. The
visions of the prophet should not be wasted on finding trivial matters of rules
in this world. That is a devastaing waste of life, and to the person that
wishes to dismiss my visions simply because they do not have well defined
rules, I implore you to attempt to open your soul, not your mind but yes, your
soul, to my teachings, so that you may visit there yourself, because I know in
my heart that any soul can find it in themselves to visit, and when you visit
tell me if you still wish to know the rules of this world. If you visit, and
you say, "Yes, I would like to know the rules of this otherworld" still then
you have missed all of the other beauty and knowledge that can be gained from
the mere experience of the other. And perhaps you truly did experience all of
teh beauty and knowledge, and you have exhausted your interest in those aspects
of what I am to say to you, and if you have somehow managed to do that you are
truly more wise and connected than I can even begin to fathom, and if even
still at that point you wish to define the rules, than as one who is clearly
above myself in these matters, as a god amongst men (which such a thing is not
meant to exist) you may begin to define the rules for yourself.  But until
then (and then will never come to be I feel in my heart) I will only say that
the rules of this world are entirely secondary to the understanding of the
world.

And to those who say, "Wise sage, I have read your teachings, and I have
visited this world, but the world I visited was not like yours, but instead of
a forest where you describe a forest I saw a mountain, and instead of a god
where you saw a god I saw a tree" and etc and etc. for all the discrepancies
between your experience and mine, I say this. These discrepencies, if the world
you visited truely is the world that I visited, are merely discrepencies in the
flesh, in the manifestation of your experince of the world in comparison to
mine rather that differences in the world. Truely, we are all the product of
our enviorment, myself as any other, and our environment is what gives us these
visions. Indeed, it would be a great feet if you were able to see what I saw
exactly as I saw it, for that would be that you lived a life exactly as I lived
it, which would be a remarkable feature of our two lives being connected in
that way. You can see how absurd that would be, how maginificently impossible,
for two beings to share the exact same life experience. Indeed, truely that is
impossible, and though I do not know this to be true entirely, for I take
nothing to be the absolute truth, I know it it my heart that no two beings,
indeed, not even the smallest of quarks, would share the exact some experinces
in their life times, but instead each is taken as its own and is entirely
unique to itself.

This is why I speak of lenses and angles, when viewing this otherworld. I can
only visit and observe this world through my lens, and from my vantage point,
and you can only visit this world from your lens and your vantage point, and
this world is unique in that the lens and the vantage point don't obey the
standard rules of optics and vision of our world of light and sound. Indeed, I
hope I have impressed on you that the concepts of light and optics are complete
absurdities in this otherworld, but instead the visions and the sights and the
experinces had as they are described is merely the only way that we know how to
communicate these things to eachother, so let us communicate in that way so
that we may come to understand eachother. In fact, we must communicate with
eachother, as I truely believe that the only way to got the most complete sense
of this world is through communication and attempted understanding of all that
there is in this world.

# 20180705 Reflections of yestday, Peterson, then Michelle
So at this point, I want to cut off my ever haughty and pompous talk of "the
otherworld" to return to the disscussion of things more appropiate for a
journal entry. In fact, to say I am cutting it off is maybe inappropiate, that
is what should be done with journal entries like this, I think, and if at some
point I wish to continue than I will. Well, enough of that.

Last night I know I had a dream, and I know it involved my hair in some way,
but I don't remember it very clearly and am quite honestly not concerned with
it. Instead, I want to talk about the conversation I had with Michelle
yesterday.

So yesterday was a sort of interesting day for me. It started with my waking
up, hoping that I had slept through yoga (I think I wrote about this already)
but when I had realized I hadn't, instead of deciding to sleep through it I
decided I would do the responsible thing and cancel my appointment
(appointment?) for the class that day. So after doing that, I wrote about my
dream, and then I followed that up by listening to the podcast between Rogan
and Peterson. You see, I was feeling in one of my depressive moods that day,
feeling like "all of this is pointless" but at the same time know that that was
just my depressive self talking, and I thought about what I would do, so I
decided to listen to the podcast, and it was exactly what I needed I think. And
it wasn't exactly what I needed in terms of "oh it turned my life around"
because that's not what I think this is about, but instead it was just a gentle
reminder to me that these things happen, and that I should ride it out and make
the best of it. In the podcast, Peterson talked about the concept of setting
the bar substancially low enough to be able to reach it, and that is something
that in these moments of depression I tend to forget, and I always set the bar
just a little too high, and I decide it would be better to do nothing than to
fail to reach that bar, so as I was listening, I started to do some of my
dishes which had been piling up, and I rearranged my living area a bit so that
I could vacuum it and make it a little more "fresh" like I like to do at times,
and as I listened to the podcast I started to practice one of Chopin's etude,
the C# minor one that I kind of know, and in general, while it didn't do much
in the way of helping me "find my purpose" or anything so silly like that,
those little things really do go a long way to helping out when I get in that
mood. And the fact that yesterday was a day off, and I had all the time in the
world to do these little things helped. You see, this is something that I have
noticed before, but when you only have a short ammount of time to do these
little tasks, they feel rushed and almost painful in a way, but when I was able
to spend as much time I wanted cleaning the dishes, I was able to really just
do them as I felt. In fact, what I ended up doing was first collecting all of
the dishes, and placing them next to the sink, and once I had a sort of catalog
of all the dirty dishes that were there, and I had enough time to evaluate
honestly that this was the full of the catalog (as opposed to shoving some
dishes off to the side or into some obscure corner of the kitchen as I
sometimes do when I am dishonest about it), I was able to then take each dish
one at a time, and determine the best method of cleaning it. So some of the
silverware simply required a quick rinse and squeeze of the sponge, and after
evaluating each piece and holding it up to the light I determined that it was
quite clean in the first place and didn't need any more fine detail work, but
when I got to my quart sized plastic cups, I did a full pat down of them inside
and out, and determined that some of them had quite a bit of leftover milky
residue on them and in them, so after determining this, I was able to take my
sponge, and fill them with a bit of water, and thouroughly wash through them,
scrubbing every little corner and edge with maticulous precision, as I took
each one and determined quite satisfactorily that I had cleaned it quite
thouroughly, and taking each cup in this way, I would set them to the side to
be dried. And as I took the towel that I use to dry them, I determined that
they were not becoming as dry as I might like, so instead of putting them in
the pantry still partially wet like I do sometimes, I decided to pull out a new
towel from my drawer of towels, and see if that new towel would make them any
more dry than the one I know I haven't washed in at least a few weeks. And as
it turns out, the new towel did indeed make them quite a bit more dry than the
unclean one, so I put the unclean towel in the washing machine, with the other
dirty laundry that I wanted to get to after this, and I began using the new
towel. I then proceeded to do this with the other towel in my kitchen, so I
replaced both of them. Then, when everything was dry and put in it's proper
place, I proceeded to go into the refridgerator and throw out a couple of items
that I knew had been in there a while, and that I had been neglecting to throw
away. There were some sausage and eggs leftover from I honestly don't know how
long ago when I visited my parents and made some sausage and eggs and they
weren't received by anyone there to have for breakfast, so I took them home and
I know I ate them each once after that, but they had become quite moldy and
such, so I emptied the contents into the trash bag that I had set next to the
door to take out, and cleaned the containers and placed them in my cabinet in
the containers. To be entirely honest, I do not know how long all of this took
me, but I was listening to the Peterson podcast all the while and taking as
much time as I wanted to do each of these small little tasks, and by the end of
it I took a portabello cap and spread some avocado on it, and sat down in the
chair next to my speakers and continued to listen to the podcast while eating
my noontime snack that I have been having since I started experimenting with
intermettant fasting. And after I was finished, I continued to sit there, and I
did nothing more, until I arrived in my bathroom to take a piss, and I saw my
pipe sitting in a ziploc bag filled with salt and alcohol, and I know that it
has been sitting there for at least a week by this point, so I emptied the
contents of the bag into the toilet, and thouroughly washed through the pipe
with water, and took it out and left it to dry there sparkling as clean as new.
I then brought myself into the shower, and rinsed myself off for a bit, brushed
my teeth after drying myself, and at around this point I sat down and worked a
bit on my Russian trainer. I am not at all satisfied with how it turned out,
and indeed I knew that it wouldn't be what I wanted it to be from the get go,
but it was not at all satisfactory at all, but that is a topic for another day.
At this point, I decided to lie down and take a quick nap. It was two o'clock,
the time when I wish at work that I could take an afternoon nap but am never
allowed to (I have been absconded in the past for taking naps, so instead now I
simply sit and stare at my desk for about an hour when I wish I could simply
crawl under my desk for twenty minutes instead, so whatever) and I determined
to take a good 20 minute nap.

Well, when I woke up I checked the time and determined it to be two entire REM
cycles later at five o'clock. I was of course surprised at this, as I had not
intended to hit even one REM cycle, and I swore at myself for a moment before
deciding that it was okay. All this time through the day, I had been checking
my phone a few times to see if I was getting any messages from anyone, and I
had not been, so I got up and proceeded to do not much of anything productive
for the next hour or so. Indeed, it was six o'clock when I decided to make a
sandwich, and as I was making a sandwich, I heard my phone vibrate on the
counter, and I checked it and found that it was Michelle texting me and my
brothers, asking if we wanted to go out for food. I replied that "Yeah, I would
like that" right as Kyle replied that he was chilling at the hospital, and
after some interaction, I decided to continue making my half made sandwich and
eat it because I needed to eat a lot of food anyway, before I decided to make
the decision to meet at twisted root. The plan then being to wait for Kyle to
text when he was leaving, I immediately went outside even as we were still
making plans, and placed my phone next to my marker for the beginning of my
running distances, and began running back and forth, keeping strong control of
my breath as I started at 6-2 In-Out breathing pace, and sped to 4-2 and
sometimes 3-2 or 3-1 pace occasionally, but staying at a pretty steady 4-2
pace. I jogged back and forth for two miles this way, intending to only run a
mile at first but extending my length first by a half a mile when I reach a
mile, and then another half mile when I reached 1.5, and when I finished I
picked up my phone and saw two missed calls from Kyle. I immediately called him
back to talk with him. Apparently, he had something in mind, a greek place that
was more centrallized, and I said if he wanted to mention that he wanted to go
there instead, we could, and that I really had no desire to go to Twisted Root
beyond the simple fact that Michelle mentioned burgers and I wanted to come to
a decision sooner rather than later. Regardless, I took my shower, and a few
minutes after that I got the text and made my way to Twisted Root.

Upon getting there, I met Michelle and Evan, and Kyle converged about the same
time, and we ordered and began talking about things. We had a very pleasent
conversation, the four of us, but I realized that I tended to dominate most of
the conversation, indeed, Kyle did talk a little, and Evan talked very little
at all like he usually does, and thinking back on the conversation now, I spoke
for most of it. Although, that is not entirely true, as the most pleasent part
of the conversation was my inquiring of Michelle about how her and Chuck met,
and how their relationship evolved, so I was not entirely selfish in the
conversation. Regardless, we talked a bit about our dad, as we all agreed that
we were (or at least I said this and everyone tended to at least understand
completly) more concerned for my mom than we were for my dad, as she is being
very almost possessive of him, not wanting to accept help from others and not
knowing how to accept help from others. After talking a bit about that, we
transitioned to the typical "how is work going" conversation, to which Kyle and
I gave our accounts of our job and Evan remained quiet in his corner as he
always does. Then after we talked about that a little bit, Michelle talked a
bit about how she is "weddinged out" for the time being, as she mention Jaq and
then her sister Steph, both having weddings recently, and then we went to the
true heart of the conversation and what I truly enjoyed about it, which was her
inquiry of our relationship status. And this is where the conversation really
took place, where we talked a little bit about Jess's relationship with her new
boyfriend, before talking about how our relationship status today. And this is
when the conversation led to the topic of Michelle meeting Chuck, and how that
happened. To give a quick recount of how she told it, Michelle mentioned that
in school, she had a few groups of friends (as most people do), and how there
were three guys that she was good friends with, who she would hang out with on
the reg, and another group of three roommates that those roommates were friends
with, that she knew of but didn't know very well. And so she mentioned one
time, when they were all hanging out, Chuck was there, and she had known him
before but never interacted with him, and interacting with him and everyone
there, she came to a liking for him. And after that she mentioned to her
friends of the first group that she did take a liking to him, and those friends
were very much interested in playing wingman for her, and were receptive to it,
but she also talked about how she was so brutally scared of mentioning it
because she didn't want to be that girl that hangs out with a bunch of guys and
then becomes involved with one of them in a sort of fling, and she knew how
they talked and how she would be crucified if she fucked it up, but she had to
chase him a bit. And then she said, after she had expressed her liking of him,
and she knew that he knew it, how he continued to give her the cold shoulder,
to play hard to get in a way. She saw him, and he would see her, going to and
from classes and to and from the bus or the parking lot, and they might make
eye contact, but he would ignore her, and it got to a point where after a few
weeks of this, with them hanging out with their group of mutual friends and
still being of course amicable with eachother, she talked about how she almost
got the point of saying, "well to hell with him then" but they ended up going
on a date, and from there the rest is history as they say. She talked about
this with a great glow in her eyes, of her early relationship with Chuck, you
could see the love and the passion. We then took this conversation to go into
the concept of dating, and not dating in the sense of "this date should be
considered as the prospective one" but instead in the sense of "this is
practice dating" and while I very much agree, we talked then about the
difficulty that guys have now in finding a date. We also mentioned (I also
mentioned) that our mom was very much opposed to the idea of us interacting
with girls in any way, especially not in a romantic way, through even high
school, and how because of that we really missed out on a lot of the young love
dating that a lot of people go through, and that I would very much like to get
into this practice dating. I also mentioned, as I have mentioned to other
before though, how I don't know what avenue I want to use in order to get into
this world of practice dating, and after talking with Michelle, she mentioned
how she knows that Jaq has quite a lot of friends, and that while she herself
has to put great effort into interacting with others, she feels that it simply
comes naturally to Jaq, and that she would put Jaq on it. We then talked about
the camp, and now the ranch (which I have yet to visit) and the whole takeaway
of the entire conversation to me was, I will plan to visit the camp this Fourth
of July weekend just to interact with everyone there. In particular, I want to
get into fishing and hunting and all of those sorts of "outdoorsy" things, and
I want to get involved with Parker, as Parker seems like a good guy to know
when it comes to these things, so the bottom line of my conversation with
Michelle is, I want to make an effort to connect with Parker with the purpose
of both getting more involved with outdoors things and also to increase my
friend circle. As Yash told me, I should meet 10% more people every month, so
this I feel is my best effort to do that.

# 20180706 Injury at open mat, decision to not go to Houston, condemnatiion of Bikram
Okay, so as of this moment in time, it is in the afternoon, I am conflicted. So
today is Friday, and like any good Friday I decided to go to open mat. Well,
while I was at open mat, I rolled with a lot of people, as I do, and I tapped
to every one of them. That is, I went in with the intention of learning rather
than the intention of trying to tap people. Well, I must be a moron, because my
very last roll, I rolled with a guy, and I wish I could remember his name, it
was something unique, but for the life of me I can't remember, but regardless,
I rolled with him, and at first, by his demeanor and the way he was holding
himself, I thought him to be a brown belt or at least purple belt, but as I
started rolling with him I found a lot of holes in his game, he seemed
unconfident in his guard top game, and I ended up in closed guard quite easily,
and I was able to manipulate his limbs quite at my whim. Well, at this point I
went for an armbar, and it was quite deep, but he was able to get a good gable
grip to save it, and at that point I could have really pulled on it to try and
finish it, but I decided it wasn't worth the time, so I returned to guard and
kept playing. I was able to break his posture, and play with him, and at that
moment I felt as though I could do some super cool spinny shit that I was
literally just making up on the spot. So I sat up, to do the super cool spinny
shit, but he stood up as well and we ended up standing and my super cool spinny
shit ended with me in turtle and him attacking my back. Well, that is obviously
not where I wanted to be, but we played there for most of the match, me trying
to do things from turtle, and he made it to side mount but it was a sort of
shitty side mount (in comparison to Troy earlier who had me in a very strong
side mount that ended with a head in arm choke that almost put me to sleep) and
I was able to recover guard easily. And so we are back in guard, and I hear the
thirty second buzzer, and that is when my ego kicked in. I thought about how
much this guy must think I suck, because he was attacking me from turtle the
entire time, and I thought about how, if this were a match, he would have been
up for sure on points, and I felt again the arm bar, so I went for it again. It
was the same arm as the first one, and he saved himself with the same gable
grip, but it felt deep, and it was the end of the round, so this one I decided
to really pull on, and I pulled on it for quite some time, and as I was pulling
on it, just before the final time went off, I felt something in my spine right
where it meets the hip come out of place. I have felt it before many months ago
going for a triangle on the big guy whose name is escaping me, and this time
was no different. Well, I came back to guard, but I immediately knew that I had
pulled some kind of muscle in my low back there, and the time stopped maybe 5
seconds later, and I thanked him as best I could and went to turtle to try and
alleviate the pressure. I then hobbled to the restroom, took my shower, and did
my best to move as slowly as possible so as not to hurt it.

I tell of this story for a few reasons. One, it goes to show that as much as I
think my ego is gone, it still decides to intrude itself, and it always does so
in these awful ways that end with some aspect of my body getting hurt. Two, I
was just thinking about only yesterday how grateful I am to be young, and how
grateful I am that my body can recover from my foolishness so well, and how
important it is to train for my fifty year self rather than my tomorrow self.
How ironic that this would happen not even 24 hours after that thought. Three,
I have entirely reconsidered going to Houston for the Fourth celebration.

You see, this morning, only this morning, I have packed all of my things, and
arranged it all nice and neat in my bags, and gotten a few pairs of underwear,
and some jeans, and some sleep shorts, and all of the other assorted things
that go into packing for a trip that would last one day and two nights. I even
went back to my apartment after this mornings training with Paco, and grabbed
some towels which I had forgotten, and a fresh gi in case I wanted to visit an
open mat in Houston on Saturday. I have everything prepared, and the plan was
this morning to leave for Houston immediately after work. Now, though, I have
entirely reconsidered that plan, for a few reasons. The first and most
practical is, I very much do not want to drive in the car with my low back in
the state that it is right now. Not only will it not be comfortable, but also
it will not be the best idea to constrain myself to that level of treatment to
something which is important. Indeed, if I am careful about it and treat it
well, by back will be mostly recovered by the morning, with proper care and
mobility treatment, but if I lock it into the sitting position, while it
certainly won't become anything permanent or anything crazy like that, it will
take longer to recover, and I don't want that. But the other reason is, and
this is something that I didn't really think about, but when I talked with
Michelle about this weekend, and I thought about it, she has mentioned that it
will be a lot of Jaq and Jess's friends, and as I said before, I do want to be
able to interact with Parker and Chuck more, as both of them are very outdoorsy
types and I want to get more into the outdoorsy stuff, but when it comes to the
inteactions that are going to be going on at the camp, I will be very out of
place in the sense that it will be a bunch of people that know eachother, and
then me, and while I am sure that I will be able to occupy myself at the camp,
I certainly do not want to go there feel ostracized by these girls and boys.
Indeed, I am in a sort of strange spot where I don't fit in with the kid crew
anymore, but I don't quite fit in with the adults, at least not in the sense
that I think. But all of this is simply me coming up with excuses not to go
now. You see, I was all prepared and ready to leave immediately after work
today, but this popping of my low back (not popping, but rather straining) has
somehow brought into my head all sorts of excuses to change my mind. It's quite
amazing how the brain is able to do that. When I was in physical form to make
the car ride, I was ready to go, but now all I can think of is my back, and how
it feels, and working on mobilizing it and taking care of it. Which is all the
right thing to do. But it's not until that physical manifestation of an
legitimate reason not to go appears that I start to come up with the other
reason why I don't want to go. It's a very interesting phenomenon, and one that
I have not thought about before, and could be a very interesting idea for some
characters to go through. All of this is quite interesting to me.

At this point, I think the best course of action would be this. I should text
Michelle, and let her know my course of action, saying something like how I
thought about coming to the camp this weekend but have passed, but how I would
like to know when people are doing things, and then I could perhaps get from
her hopefully Parker's number, or at the very least some sort of snapchat or
groupme group or something that I could become a part of that I know they use
to communicate when they do things, and then I could become a part of that and
aim to visit Houston more often, or the Ranch which is off of Austin I think,
and in that way I could get more connected with Parker and start to have things
to do with people more. Because stuff like yoga is great, but there is no
"fishing club" that I could become a member of and just start showing up to,
and even if there were, I don't know if I would really want to become a member
of something like that. I mean, I would certainly go for a trial or something,
and from there who knows, but the entire discussion is pointless since there
isn't such a thing.

So I think the course of action is this. I will go to my apartment, eat a bunch
of the beef that I bought yesterday (which I think I have found as the god send
of foods, I bought some marbled steaks for four bucks a pound, which is totally
reasonable, and once I get the art of cooking it down, it will be really good.
I took down two slabs yesterday, which comes out to be about a pound, and I
could have gone for maybe even a little more. On top of that, cooking it was
literally a matter of heating up some oil in a pan and searing it for legit
three minutes, and it had a nice rare center and while it was a touch chewy and
could have been a little more tender, it went down effortlessly) and after or
before or during that, I will spend the rest of the evening mobizing my back
and downing Ibuprofin like it's candy. Then from there, I will read some, or
watch some, or maybe watch some as I mobilize and read some after, go to sleep
in the comfort of my apartment, and decide when I wake up what I want to do. I
know certainly I want to visit my father some time this weekend, especially if
I am to forgoe my trip to Houston, but I don't know when exactly I would intend
to do that.

Something I do want to say, I have neared the end of three and a half straight
weeks of Bikram. I missed a Saturday, and then with the Fourth, I decided to
just cut it there. I will say this. Doing it everyday is a struggle in a few
ways. The first is, you really have to keep on top of the laundry, and the
water intake and all of the management of the schedule required to get to and
from the studio. That shit isn't hard, but it's still a part of the struggle.
That, on top of the fact that sixty minutes is not a short ammount of time, and
when it's all said and done, it eats up a good two hours of the day that could
have been spent cooking, or reading, or any other activity that you could
imagine. Secondly, another difficulty is that none of the days ever become a
good day. Yes, there are certainly days that are better than others, but I
noticed after taking a two day break and coming back to it on a third day after
that (72 hours between sessions) I was much more mentally able to get myself
into the zone, that zone where every posture you hit your edge, and you are
able to feel as though you are gaining something out of it rather than just
doing it because you are obligated to. Doing it every day in a row, I started
to feel that most days became the "okay, I'm here just to do the best that I
can with my body right now" rather than the "wow, I feel good today, and I want
to be here and I am genuinely curious about what I can do today with my body
right now", and there are certainly days where the former will be the case no
matter how you practice (and that's true of anything) but I noticed after only
two days break, I had felt that I hadn't had one of those days in a long time,
and I felt fresh and ready and excited to do the work. Now, you could argue
that I had hit that only because I did have so many maintainence days in a row,
and the special day is a tribute to the high volume work at it's best. In fact,
now that I think on it, that is most definitely what happened. However, there
must certainly be a balance, and more for the first reason I mentioned rather
than the second do I feel that Bikram yoga every day is tough. It's just a lot
of time out of the day, and I have other things that I want to do other than
practice 26 postures sometimes.

The last thing I want to say about Bikram every day is that I feel that
sometimes I just want to flow, and doing Bikram every day leaves no days to
dedicate to just flowing. In fact, now that my low back is in the state it is,
I very much want to have a "just flow" day to work on it, and I am greatly
looking forward to that this evening. The 26 postures, all the same in the same
order with no variation, not even mixing up which side you do first, it get's
wearisome and dull, and while it's good in the sense of being the other extreme
of my criticism of Crossfit, you could argue that Crossfit is good in being the
other extreme of my criticism of Bikram, so there has to be a balance there
that I can strike by not dedicating myself to Bikram and instead treating it as
another tool (which I have been doing, but it's very difficult to see it that
way when you do it every fucking day). Enough on that.

# 20180707 Recap of the day - Codemnation of PBJ - Discovery of the hermit
Okay, so today has been a weird day for me so far. I can honestly say that I
haven't done much of anything since the day started, but I feel as though I
somehow have done a lot of things. To recap what I have done today.

During the night, I know I had a dream. I know this dream was interesting,
because I remember waking up to a half awake half asleep state, and thinking
about how I was a little excited because I had a good dream, and that I knew it
still wasn't time to wake up yet, but that I should remember the dream when I
do and promptly go to write it down. Well, many hours later after sleeping some
more, I didn't dream any more and I entirely forgot what the dream was. So that
was that.

The second thing I remember is coming to the realization that my low back was
not feeling any better than it was the day before, and in fact was about the
same level of shitiness. As I started to move around, and get up, I quickly
determined that it was indeed no better, and I got up and paced for a bit
resenting this fact. I popped some more ibuprofin (which I will do again after
I finish writing here) and continued to walk around a bit, thinking about how
much I wanted to smoke some weed, thinking about how much more aware and how
much more able I would be to treat it if I could only smoke some marijuana.
Fuck me there too man.

Thirdly, I spent some time edging myself to pictures of women on reddit. It was
nothing too extreme, but I definitely did some legitmate masterbating. In fact,
even just talking about it right now is making me uneasy, and I am finding
myself wanting to return and do it again. But we are not doing that, we are
writing instead.

Fourthly, I constructed an even warlock deck in Hearthstone and played a bit of
that. I am currently at rank shit tier this season (rank 23 and up) and have
had 100 % success with this deck so far. Of course, when I actually start
playing against not rank shittier, I do not know how it will go, but that is
taht.

Lastly, and in my time leading up to this journal article, I screwed around on
D3 with Evan a bit, since I saw he and Kyle were playing it, and I decided to
get on just for the shits and giggles. It was interesting enough, but it was
mostly just running around asking about the new game mechanics and things like
that.

So all of that to say, I don't know what to make of myself this morning and
day. I think I have decided to give up PBJ all-together, especially in the
mornings. I ate I don't know how much steak last night, but I was still hungry
when I woke up today, and I have eaten two PBJ's and I think I have finally
made the association of PBJ and this sort of apthetic, easily distracted, brain
weary state that I am in right now. I can't seem to concentrate on any one
topic for very long, and when I try to I seem to sit here in a blurry haze of
just, I don't know what. Something in the combination of bread, PBJ, and milk,
puts me in this state. I think it might me wise at this point to simply cut the
bread alltogether, and the milk, and the PBJ, and try strictly eating an
omnivore diet, and by that I mean meat and veggies. It is too easy for me to
reach for PBJ in times of hunger and boredom like this, and I think that it
might be the source for a lot of shit for me in my life, so I have decided to
cut it. I am not sure if I would like to cut milk at this point as well, but I
certainly think that these marbled beef cuts that I have found at Sam's could
very well be the solution to a lot of other things that are shitty in my life
right now.

In fact, I find this quite interesting that I have this perception that I have
a lot of shitty things in my life right now. I think it is the food that I have
eaten talking. Right now (and it is the mid-afternoon mind you, and this is
something that happens at this point anyway), I have this strong urge to not
do anything productive at all, as if doing something productive would hurt me
right now, as if doing something like rotating my laundry and cleaning my gi
would somehow be a detriment to my life. In fact, I am quite forcing myself to
continue on writing right now, where if I were to give in to my impulses, I
would be browsing reddit or playing more games of Hearthstone mindless or any
other such pointless task, but instead I am very much forcing myself to keep
writing because I have decided that is what I want to do right now. I keep
glancing down at the clock in the corner of my monitor to see it to be only a
few minutes past the previous time that I looked down at it, and every time I
do so I get this entire sense of dread as though I won't be able to last
another fourty minutes of writing, which if I would seek to aim to get to my
desired goal of one hour of writing a day I would have to reach at this moment
in order to accomplish.

On that subject also, I dread the idea of picking up any book and reading it.
Even just the concept of having something in front of me to process and
comprehend is too much for me right now. I don't give a shit about Achilles in
the Iliad, I don't care if Aeneis makes it to Rome, I couldn't give a flying
fuck about whether or not Mitya is going to kill his father, and Vin and her
magical metal burning powers can go fuck themselves. However, when it comes to
mindlessly watching clickbait youtube videos where people take excerpts from
other peoples channels and put them on their own, that is something I can get
behind. This is something I have always struggled with. Why is it that I feel
comfortable wasting my time doing something that is entirely unproductive, but
at the same time I won't spend that same time doing something productive like
learning Russian, or writing (which I am very much forcing myself to continue
to do right now) or playing the piano, or visiting my father, or anything else?
Why is it that I will stay awake consuming mindless fodder that I know will get
me nowhere in life (or at least, the intention is that it will do nothing for
me) but I won't spend that same time to something that my produce fruit in the
end? Both this writing, and the watching youtube videos each take a minimal
amount of effort. In fact, I could simply have the textbook of Russian words
and shit just open, and I could read the words, and try and pronounce them, and
that would take no more effort on my part than figruing out games of
Hearthstone would, or calculating gear scores or whatever it is in Diablo, but
for some reason I feel compelled to spend my time on the latter rather then the
former. What is that?

I am somewhat convinced, or at least hopeful, that it has to do with the sugars
in the PBJ and milk that I just ate. In fact, not only sugars, but maybe also
whatever processed fats and shit goes into the peanut butter that I ate as
well. I do not beleive it has anything to do with the ibuprofin I have taken,
as Ibu. has never had this effect on me in the past, at least not that I've
noticed. More the reason I can rule out Ibu. is because I have had this sort of
effect on my brain before, and I very much know that I have felt this way
before, and so I feel like it has to have something to do with something that I
have always done. I feel like it has to be diet.

The first time I remember distincly identifying this feeling was in college.
And I know I have had this feeling many times before this moment, but this was
the first moment I remember putting it into my brain. The first time I remember
experiencing this feeling was when I was watching a Carlin standup video, and
as I was listening to the words, it was as if the words were coming at me after
I could process them. It was like he was saying things, and the things he was
saying weren't reaching me until way after he said them, but by the time they
reached me he was already saying different things, and I just couldn't keep up
with what he was saying, and I eventually turned off the video. Now, at the
time of that, I believe I was high, so I attributed that feeling to the feeling
of being high, but now I think I am coming to the realization that that feeling
probably has to do with what I've eaten, and there is no doubt in my mind that
it is very likely that I had eaten a PBJ before that moment of first realizing
about this feeling. So knowing that now, I will entirely cut the PBJ from my
life and the bread and the milk, and work on eating only beef, veggies,
mushrooms, and water and tea from this point forward, and through changing my
diet in that way, I will determine observe if my feelings of discondcordance
has to do with diet or if it has to do with something else. Indeed, it might
just be something that happens to me, but when it happens it doesn't usually
have this sort of effect on me. Right now it feels as though it is having an
actual physical effect on me, and its making me upset and irritated. I am
feeling like the entire act of writing right now is draining me physically. And
it's not the actual act of pressing the keys that's draining me, it just feels
like the fact that I am continuing to type, and the fact that I know I will
plan to continue to type for some amount of time, it is making me wearisome and
filled with dread. Indeed, I don't know how many words I have typed since I
mentioned that I had forty minutes to go, but it feels like I have been saying
words and words and words and words, and that no matter how much I type there
is still just a mountain more that I am going to have to type, and it has only
been fifteen minutes since that point and I feel like I haven't accomplished
anything with it and that there is still this mountain to overcome.

I will take a break and drink some water, because I know I am dehydrated as
well.

Okay, I got up and had some water and have set the pitcher to start filling up
with some more water. I will plan to go back in a few sentences and drink some
more. Just that walking up and drinking some water already made me feel
slightly better, and there is some meta analysis that I want to talk about in
regards to the story of the hermit, so by the time I am finished writing this
paragraph, the pitcher should have finished filling and I will be able to go
and drink a bunch of water, and bring the pitcher with me, and drink out of the
pitcher in a steady pace while I write.

I just went to check on the pitcher, and it is not done filling, but is still
draining through the filter and into the pitcher. Indeed, I don't want to
start writing on any chain of thought, because I so hate having my chains of
thought become inturrupted by things such as getting up to grab water, so that
is the purpose of this paragraph, to give myself more time as filler in between
the grabbing of the water and the actual writing of my ideas.

Okay, I'm back now with the pitcher of water in front of me. I will say that
the feeling of the feeling going away was merely psycho somatic, as I can
garuntee that the feeling is still there. However, having some water certainly
helps that feeling, and I feel as more towards the end of the spectrum of
"doing productive things is not painful" anymore, and less on the rather
strange end of "doing productive things is pointless and painful and not worth
it". So let's talk about the tale of my hermit.

So far, what my idea of the tale of the hermit has come to is this. I have my
four characters, one of which is a brutish man, the sort of man who is an
aggressive athiest, and will justify his contempable actions by saying things
like "well if there is no god that means we can do whatever we want with no
consequences". And I want my intelligent and open Christian to be a girl. What
sort of girl this is I do not know yet. There are two ways I could go with
this, and one would be that this girl is a sort of "born-again" Chirstian, and
that she used to live a sinful or dreadful life, perhaps burdened by addiction
or promiscuosness (which is certainly a female sin much more than it is a male
one) or some other such thing and that she found Christianity and through that
she found her ways. I think this would make more sense as the dogmatic
Christian, which would make the most sense since this is the one I would have
be the most tied to her faith. So that has those two characters pretty well
defined in an extremely broad sense.

For the other two characters, I want to have the open minded athiest or
agnostic be a male, and the open minded Christian be a female. I really like
the idea of the open minded Christian being someone who was born in raised in a
good household, having the sort of parents that were also Christian, but they
were the good sorts of Christians who would go to church but would always let
their daughter decide if she wanted to join them on Sunday's or whatever. And
maybe I could talk about how on some Sundays she decided not to go, simply
because she didn't feel like it or whatever, but she always felt guilty about
it, and even more so because it seemed like her parents were perfectly happy
with her not going, and in their abscence she could feel the presence of god
speak within her, and the devil, rather just the devil, and she could feel the
devil work within her, and she would feel great guilt at her decision, as if
she were turning her back on god. She could even have a moment in one of these
times where she looked upon a cross or something else that was displayed in
their house, and upon looking at the cross she would feel great anguish, as if
she herself were guilty for the death of Jesus, as the church would have us
believe. So that would be the story for my open Christian character.

And that leaves lastly the Agnostic, or the Open Athiest, or whatever other
Character. This Character I want to have the background be very similar to
mine, with parents that were horrible Christians, and he constantly had
Christianity shoved down his throat. He went through a period of rebellion, and
contempt for the world, he went and lived in his car in Seattle and got
involved with pchedelics, and through that he has kept an open mind about all
religion, but only to the extent that the religion will match with what he
knows about the world. This Character might say something like "The fact that
there is an invisible man in the sky that created us is no more unreasonable
than the idea that we all were born up out of the chaos of the universe, and
the facts of these matters on obscures the hidden truth which is what we should
all strive to find" or something like that.

And now that I have these four characters, somewhat fleshed out but not in an
entirely satisfactory manner, I lastly want to talk about the hermit. I still
haven't decided what I want this "manifesto of the hermit" to be. What I have
written above, a few days ago, talking about spirits and gods, leading up to
the spirit of Adam which is the spirit I first want to create in my mythology
as the spirit or god that brought life into man, and is the father of all the
other gods, does not fit into the original idea of this story. The original
idea of the story was that this hermit wrote this manifesto, or his magnum
opus, or whatever, in the isolation of his cottage, and in this magnum opus,
the idea was that he had visions of this other world, and in this other world,
he was able to make predictions about this world. The idea of the story then,
is that all of these characters would read this magnum opus, these visions,
ramblings of a hermit, whatever you want to call them, and after they had read
them they became entirely true, undeniably true, to the point where it would be
unreasonable not to accept the ramblings of the hermit to be the actual nature
of the universe. The idea then is that, in this sort of undeniable evidence, I
want to show the reactions and interactions of my four characters as they try
and cope with and understand what they have read.

I like this concept and I don't all at the same time. On the one hand, it could
make for an interesting read. On the other hand, it seems much too cute.
Perhaps what I have to do is make the ramblings of the hermit seperate from my
mythology. Because I have a great love for mythology in my mind, I always have
since the first time I read of the greeks and the greek myths, and I don't want
it to be reduced to this sort of "undeniable truth". Such a reduction is for
things like physics, things that you can make experiments for and such. So
perhaps these ramblings of the hermit, maybe it has to be entirely seperate.

And I guess that's where I am struggling. In another sense, this mythology I
have in my head has to do with a sort of fantasy world that I want to create.
Indeed, the Iliad very much takes place in a fantasy world, especially in the
sense that the gods actually interact with the regular man, and while I do have
something like that in my mind as to what I want my story and my mythology to
be, to mix it up with this sort of ramblings of the hermit seems wrong. Before
I begin to write on this story, I need to straighten out in my head what the
world of the hermit should be, what the world of my mythology is, and if they
should intersect at all.

I think what makes the most sense is to write a sort of writers epilogue. I
deem it important to provide a commentary in addition to the story. Such a
thing could work, I think, as I feel it is neccesary due to the absurdness of
the story. It goes against the "show don't tell" principle of writing, but in
this case I think, since this story will be much too cute otherwise, I deem it
neccesary to talk about the absurdity of a hermit coming up with the meaning of
the universe and being able to write it down.

So to summarize my meta-brainstorming on this subject, what I am left with is
this. I want there to be a Hermit, and this Hermit writes a document detailing
out the nature of the world. One of the critical features of this document will
be the renouncement of Christianity as a valid system, and the proposition of
some other sort of god. In this ficional world (very fictional, that will have
to be noted in the commentary just how absurdly fictional this sort of scenario
is) this hermit has actually visited another realm, and in this realm he met an
actual being, and the being proved to him that the entire things was real by
giving him a sequence of events that will happen in a certain way. This hermit
than records these events, and that is what is left in "The Ramblings of a
Hermit". I would even like this Hermit to mention at the end that he can only
have faith that the vision he has are correct, and that he knows that he will
die. I want a principle feature of this also to be some set rules about the
afterlife, maybe it's not structured like heaven and hell, but rather in some
other way, and in this way the hermit will be able to see what is going on. So,
in this entirely absurd scenario, the hermit makes his manifesto, puts it away,
and proceeds to die. It is not until many decades later, long long after the
hermit has died, that these four characters find this manifesto, and they each
read it in their turn. I want in there to be the recording of some events which
happened before their time, and then I want there to be some mentions of
events, very specific events so as to eliminate ambiguity. I want these four
charcters to be called out by name, even, for their date of births to recorded,
even perhaps the names of their parents. I then want some event that these four
took part in together, that they took part in together, (perhaps they murdered
someone, ooooooh, I like that a lot) and I want the details of that event, that
murder, to be told out in detail. I then want these characters to discuss this,
and its implications. The conversation will have to be discovered, I could not
begin to write an outline for them, but essentially the whole point of this
work would be to write the interactions of these four characters as they
discuss the implications of these visions of the hermit. I only just came up
with the idea of murder, but that gives this story so much more weight. I love
it. It also entirely divorces my story from the actual mythology that I want to
create. So the ramblings of a hermit as I think about them now, compared to the
ramblings of *this* hermit, these two are entirely different hermits in
entirely different stories.

I like it, this story is starting to gain traction for me, and I am curious to
see where it could go.

Well, it is interesting, I have gone twenty minutes past my alloted time now.
It's amazing what I little water can do for the soul. I do think I will decide
to forgoe bread, PBJ, and milk, for at least a few days. I might add milk back
in and only at night just because I have some milk in my fridge right now and I
don't want it to go bad, but I don't feel bad throwing out the six or eight
slices of bread I have, and the peanut butter and jelly won't go bad, so I will
try and do better about sticking to this diet. I will combine it with IF as
well. So mushroom with avocado, beef, and some veggies, with tea and lots of
water (I'll have to figure out more veggies). I like it.

Now to Hearthstone.

# 20180708 Dream: Pregnancy and the adjudcator - Preamble to my father
So today I had a most vivid and most unsettling dream, that surely indicates
the guilt I am feeling at neglecting my work duties. The dream took place in a
hotel. I have had other dreams in this hotel before, but the description of the
hotel is largly irrelevent. The dream started with me challenging people to a
sort of game. The game went like this. There was a bunch of ice on a counter,
and the goal of the game was to collect all of the ice and transfer it from the
counter and into a bucket without getting any on the floor. It's a rather
simple game, and the only sort of game that would make sense to play in a
dream. Obviously (to my waking self, and later to my dream self) the way to win
this game is to pick up the bucket, place it  on the side of the counter, and
use your other arm to corale the ice so that it falls in the bucket. Now, at
this point I need to mention an important detail about this game. I was only
challenging pregnant people to play this game. And I say pregnant people,
because there were two people I remember I challenged to this game. First was
Cara, the receptionist at work. Now when she played the game, I remember
looking on with a sort of curiosity, as she would scrape the ice off of the
counter and into her other hand, and then she would try to get the ice from her
hand into the bucket, but she lost a lot of ice to the floor in doing so, which
was the nature of the challenge. Now there was no rule that you couldn't pick
up the bucket, but to my dream self, and to the people of the dream, that step
wasn't entirely obvious. So I watched Cara do this, and I remember feeling a
bit embarrassed for her, as she was clearly extremely pregnant while doing
this, and her handicap was noticably hindering her. I didn't think much of
this. Then I remember challenging another person to the game. This person was a
pregnant man. Now, I don't know what that means in the context of this dream.
In fact, I remember after he played the game, I was talking with my brother
Kyle about the whole thing, and mocking him a bit. I remember saying something
like "I don't know if he's a chick that identifies as a dude and got pregnant
anyway, or if he's somehow like that Arnold Schartzenegger in that movie that I
know he got pregnant in, I don't really know." If I can give a breif
description of him, he had short hair for a girl but long hair for a guy, he
was probably in his late thirties or early forties, and he took the fact that
he was pregnant as something that was completely normal. I will also note that
while he did have a noticable tummy, he was not very pregnant, only pregnant
enough for it to be visible, and for him to be a candidate for this game that I
was playing. Well, after he finished up the game, and spilled a bunch of ice on
the floor like Cara did, and he went off into another room of the hotel, a room
where there were other people who were socializing, that I think I had come
from previously in the dream but I forgot about that section of the dream, I
was talking with Kyle about the whole thing. And as I was talking with Kyle, I
started to mock in a sort of way the pregnant people who were failing at this
game. I picked up the bucket and said something like "look how easy this is"
and I scraped all of the ice with my left forearm from the counter and funneled
it into the bucket, and got all of the ice in the bucket in just a couple of
scoops. I then remarked something like "it's so easy but these people don't
think to do it, they just go on with their ways and then move on" (which indeed
is how a lot of people treat puzzles and such when they don't discover the
solution to them right away). I think I also made some comment about their
pregnancy as well (lately, in real life, I have made the observation that there
is nothing less attractive than a pregnant woman. Indeed, it is extremely
repulsive to me, like disgustingly so, and I have been surrounded by so many
pregnant women lately that it makes me want to vomit sometimes. But that's
another topic for another writing session). As I was mocking in this way,
almost stunned that none of the people that played this game could figure out
so simple a solution, and Kyle is just sorta standing there being the receiver
of this without providing input, my mom walks up to me and tells me that I
shouldn't mock these women in this way, and that not everyone is as smart as I
am. At this, I said something like, "Well, I'm not mocking them to make fun of
them, I only discovered this solution after seeing the game and then getting
a night of sleep, but I find it fascinating none the less that the solution is
so obvious but people continue to try and solve this puzzle the hard way
without aiming to find a better one." And I tell you that fascination was more
the feeling that I felt there much more than ridicule, and while I certainly
was ridiculing a touch these people, and putting them into the box of
"disgusting pregnant folk", I was more fascinated by this whole game and I
wanted to share just how simple the game really was, and I was intrigued that
none of the pregnant people had found a solution. In this dream there was no
control either (this didn't come up in the dream, but just in my observation of
it awake now) so whose to say if I asked someone who wasn't pregnant how they
would have faired. Regardless, after replying to my mom like so, she then asked
Kyle if we could have a moment, and she then came to talk to me. This is when
the tone of the dream shifted from this game to my work habits. After Kyle has
escaped into the other room to socialize with the others, my mom asked me about
my writing and journal habits, if I saved them on the work computer or if I
saved them on Github. I then replied that I saved them on github, and that
while the work computer was where I would sometimes write on them, everything
was stored on github and that was the place where my journal was kept. Then she
said something like, "well, you might want to reconsider that", mentioning
also something about how everything done on a work machine could be taken as
work property. I then continued to justify myself, saying that all of my
documents were stored on Github and not on my work machine, and that I could
wipe entirely from my work machine the documents and they would still exist on
github, so I wasn't technically using my work machine to write my jounals but
instead I was using github to store them. She just mentioned that I should be
very careful with what I am doing, and that I shouldn't be so carefree when it
comes to handling these sorts of issues, and went off, not into the other room
where people were socializing, but instead back, out of the hotel room entirely
and into the main hallway that leads to a sort of mutual area (similar to the
mutual areas on the upper floors of the res-hall). I did not follow her
immediately, but instead went to pick up the ice that had been spilled on the
floor as a result of this pregnant man playing the game. I rememeber being
introspective in this moment, thinking about the way I was mocking the people,
and I thought about how others might see my fascination with thier struggles as
rude, but at the same time I wasn't sure the best way to truely express my
fascination without coming off as rude, so I just kept picking up the ice, and
placed it all neatly on the counter where it belonged, not as an ice game but
as a regular bucket of ice, and I stepped to walk out of the room. As I was
walking out of the room, I remember looking to the left into the other room
where everyone was sociallizng, and I remember feeling a sort of feeling that I
get some time of isolation but then gratitude in my isolation, as I saw them
all socializing about I don't know what, and I thought about how I could have
entered there if I had wanted to, but decided to move along and find my own
path for that time. So I walked out of the room entirely, into the hallway, and
I made it to this mutual area, feel quite light and jolly about life, not in a
hop and skip sort of way, but in the sort of way where I will walk with my head
level, slowly, just taking in everyone and everything with a childlike
facsnation, and in this state I walked into the mutual area, still being
contemplative about my mom's words that I shouldn't take things so lightly. And
as I walked in, a man, much bigger than me, and big in the sense that this dude
could have been a bouncer, came up to me and said, "Brett Webster, come with
me" and he grabbed me by the sleve started to drag me (not off of my feet,
because I was instinctually compelled to walk where he did because his grip
was quite strong, and he portrayed a very storng aura of authority), and right
as he made this move, I said something like "Woah there, don't I have rights? I
don't have to follow you or tell you anything, I have a choice in this matter"
(and this came up because it still haunts me to this day that I gave consent
to that police officer to search my car, and I will even rehearse now
alternatives to that scenario where I instead calmly but firmly insist that I
be on my way) and he simply replied "no you don't, now come with me." to which
I couldn't argue with his authority. As he took me off, he took me through the
common area, into a more public common area, and we had to weave in between
some tables, and I remember as we wove inbetween these tables, I took myself
and kind of swung between the chairs (that had people in them) on top of them
as if I was on paralell bars, just because that was easier and more fun than
weaving through them. So when we got to the table, he already had all of the
forms laid out, and said something like this. "I need you to sign these 401k
forms indicating the adjudication of your employment." Now that entire
statement is patently absurd, but since it was my dream authority self telling
me them, they made perfect sense to me, I was being fired from my job, and as I
thought through the whole statement, I remember thinking in the dream "I guess
401k refers to both the retirement plan and the status of employment, they must
use the same forms" and I remember being intrigued by that. I also remember
thinking "well wait, Nick said they gave Hayden ample warning before firing
him, am I not receiving the same treatment?" Well, right as he was coming to
these realiizations, my 6:20 alarm went off, the alarm I didn't know I had
right next to me (indeed, as I said before, yesterday was an interesting day,
that ended with me putting on some hearthstone tournament on youtube and
falling asleep to that), and I immediately woke up with the same sense of "well
shit" that I had in the dream at being fired, and I had to evalute "okay, am I
sure that it is Sunday? Yes, I am sure, and I still have my job and that entire
thing was a dream." Well I did go back to sleep after comforting myself in that
way. I know I had another dream involving Collin at the Jason's Deli dream
location that I have been to before, but I don't remember any details of that
dream, and I don't even remember if it was before or after the adjudicator
dream. However, this is great, because I know what the adjudicator looks like
in my psyche now, which is a great thing to know. Of course, the dream itself
is unsettling, as it indicates that the guilt I feel towards slacking and
abusing the rope we are given at Alliant has gotten to the point that I feel
guilty about it to the point where the adjudicator in my dreams is firing me
from my job, but quite honestly at this moment I am more excited at having met
the adjudicator than I am distressed at having such a dream. And that is only
true at this moment now, if you would have asked me as soon as I woke up to
explain the consequences of my dream, I would have certainly said that my
strongest feeling in that moment was the sort of deflation one feels when you
learn that you've been fired, followed immediatly (after firmly convincing
myself that I had not been fired and that I still had my job) by the
introspection of my actions at my workplace, and the realization that it has
gotten to the point that I am having dreams about the consequences of my lack
of productivity.

I will certainly come back later today to write more, I just don't know about
what yet, and at this moment I need to take a break.

So I was correct in that I would come back and write more today. I was
incorrect that I was going to be writing about a lot. I have just got back from
visiting my father at the hospital and my mother at the house. I have a lot to
talk about, but now is not the time. I pray for a dream tonight, whatever that
dream may be. If the dream does not come, at the very least I will have
something to write about, that is entirely certain. But not now. Not now. Now
is the time for meditation and rest.

# 20180709 Dreams: Tyrant in prison, Roughnecks practice, Visit with my father, CaringBridge post drafts (that turn into nothing)
So tonight I had a dream. I had two dreams, actually, in spite (or perhaps
because of) my poor sleep. The first dream is the more important, or at least I
think it is. This dream happened in a location that I am not entirely conviced
is new to me, but suffice it to say that it is the location of a prison. In
fact, now that I think on it, last time I was in this dream I was on the
outside coming in, but now this time the dream began (as far back as I can
remember) on the inside. But this prison is not like a prison how you might
think of it. Rather, it is a large, multistory building, very tall, and in the
other dream I remember going into a room with a lot of hanging catwalks that
came out into a large fan area. In another part of the room entirely (in fact,
the area that the fan area is supposed to be doing fan things for I suppose) I
was at the base of a large stairwell. And at this point, at the point that the
dream begins, I will tell a bit about the nature of this jail. So the cells in
the jail, which I know are the places that the cellmates are meant to sleep,
that area is at the top, and there is nothing really to mention about that area
except that I saw it at the end of the dream. However, at the beginning of the
dream, we were meant to do work, to provide power, and this work, I don't
remember the nature of it, and in fact I don't believe I dreamed of this work
at all, I just knew that in the basement, down the long spire of stairs (stairs
that fold like a regular staircase, back and forth across multiple levels) at
the base floor, I found myself in the cell, with other cell mates doing work.
And at the start of the dream, we were done with the work, and we knew that it
was time to carry our things and arrive back at the top of the staircase where
we would be evaluated and judged and sent back to our cells. There was another
cell mate with me there, who had the exact image of one of the cell mates I had
in male holding while I was in jail less than three months ago now. I remember
he and I had a conversation about the nature of the work, and I know that he
was complaining in some sense about it, and my nature was simply resolved in
continuing to do what needed to be done, seeing no reason to complain.
Regardless, we took up all of our things, our tools, (which reminded me of pool
noodles of all things, but that was just one of the things we carried in our
arms as we climbed) and we took all of these things, and we began to climb the
stairs, back up to our cells. And I also remember having more conversations
with other jail members (I intentionally avoided the word cell mate, as that
word seems wrong in this context) as they joined us on their climb with their
handful of supplies, and we ended up forming a sort of line as we returned to
the top floor of this cell. Now, I do feel it is important to say, the both the
bottom and the top floor of this jail were large, but I remember this
staircase being very much like a spire, and from the stairs, and even from the
top floor, there were areas you could look down and see all the way to the
bottom, and in the bottom floor I know there were sorts of generators, and
motors, and other such things that one could imagine provide power, and that
this entire building served the purpose of suppling not only power, but
something more than power, something intangible, I can't put a word to it right
now, but that it was our doom, our condemnation, to maintain this generator,
and we were driven by the wardens of this jail to do so, and that it was our
sentance, not for anything we did neccesarily, although we all had certainly
sinned in some way, but it was our sentence. So back to the climbing, as we
were climbing, we eventually made it to the top, and at the top was the head
warden of the jail, the person who I woke up with similar joy to discover,
similarly to my discovery of the Adjudicator, and this person is the Tyrant,
and it will become plain to see why as I continue. So we make it to the top,
and we are told to put our supplies in the bin, so I place all of my supplies
in the bin under the watchful, ever watchful and attentive eyes of the tyrant,
and I continue on to my cell. And as I start to make my way to the cell, I see
that my fellow cell mate has dropped his pool noodle (and the humor of the fact
that this particular supply takes the form of a pool noodle was lost on my
dream self, it seemed like a perfectly normal thing to be carrying here and I
never second guessed it's reason for being in our supplies) and after he
dropped, I reached down to pick it up. As I did so, the Tyrant, the warden
there, said to me, "Do not help those that can help themselves" or something to
that effect (those words are mine now, I know he said something in the dream
but particular words that happen in dreams escape me) and after he said this
directly to me, perhaps even with a "you there" or something similar, I
remember continuing to aid the jail mate with his pool noodle, and in a sort of
act of defiance, placed it into the recepticle where the pool noodle was meant
to go. I do not recall if I said any words to the Tyrant as I was doing this,
but I know my thoughts were a combination of "I know it is right to help my
fellow man" and "Why not?" (and the "Why not?" was a combination of
respectfulness and genuine curiosity combined with defiance), but I remember
the jail mate who dropped the noodle looked at me, not really with thankfulness
(although not with disdain either), but as I made this action, the Tyrant
announced something to the effect of, "Look, this man wishes to take on the
burden of all. Well, let him." and as the Tyrant annouced this, the
jailers began to reach the top of the stairs, and instead of unloading their
burdens and supplies in the recepticle, they began dropping them on the floor,
not just the pool noodles but the entire pack of supplies. And at this point, I
remember thinking that, if it is true that I will help my fellow man, than I
must continue to do so, even when that help is being taken advantage of, and
without missing a beat, I began to pick up the packs off the floor, which
contianed not only pool noodles, but some slipery tarps and some springy things
and some tubes which were slimy and a little gross and all sorts of absurd
things which are not heavy but simply obnoxious to deal with, (and again, the
humor of these "supplies" only comes to me now in my waking state, my dream
self did not consider this strange in the slightest) and I took them up one by
one, and I placed them in the recepticle. And I remember the Tyrant saying
something to me, something like, "Now do you see the dangers of giving your
help so freely," and I remember still being somewhat defiant, but more being
bent towards my new task of picking up these supplies and placing them in the
recepticle, not out of defiance, but just because I knew that was my new task
that had been assigned to me and I knew that I had to carry it out, not because
of any consequences (which the concept of consequences for not carrying the
burdens did not enter my head at all in the dream) but because I just knew that
was my role in that moment, and I was filling out that role.

There is a lot to unpack in what is going on in that dream, but I think the
interpretation speaks pretty well for itself in the dream itself, so I won't go
over the obvious bits here in the interest of time.

After I woke from this dream, I continued to sleep some more before my alarm
went off. I texted Paco to let him know that I had hurt my back and that it was
still in pain, and proceeded to go back to sleep in ten or twenty minute
increments. In one of those twenty minute increments, I had another dream.

So this dream was more straightforward. This dream took place at the dream
location of the Roughnecks practice field. I have been to this practice field
in my dreams before. The way it is structured, you drive up to it from the
north, and you go into a parking lot which is under the field. Then, from the
parking lot, you go up the stairs, and from there you are at the center
southern area of the field. Indeed, the entire field is built raised above the
ground, and the parking area is below. I do not remember very many details of
this dream except this. I sat there, watching the Roughnecks do their drills,
and as I watched them, I remember having a sort of desire to join in on their
drills, just for one rotation, but I knew it was not my place to do so. So I
sat there, and I watched from the center, where there were a few other
onlookers, and I got a good view from the center of their drill formation, as
they performed their drills. They were doing a sort of cutting and catching
drill, one of those drills where the throwers have a bunch of discs in a stack,
and they are throwing repeated to those in a line who each make a cut in their
turn, and the purpose of the drill is to practice running through the disc as
you catch it. And as I sat there, a small girl (it could have been Kinley, and
the fact that I think it might have been Kinley indicates to me that it was,
although the woman watching her there certainly was not Lacey) had a disc in
her hand, and was encouraged by the people throwing the discs to try her hand
at it, so she threw the disc, and it was actually on target, but very low, and
as the man (with a build very much like C.W. but not him) went for it, I
remember thinking that while the throw was certainly catchable, it's the sort
of throw that requires a lot of effort to bend down while running to catch, but
as I thought to myself "He is a Roughnecks player so surely he will catch it"
he caught it in stride (as much in stide as you can when a pass is so low) and
with a sort of grace that would be characteristic of a high level player. As
soon as he did this, many on the team cheered for her, and the girl was glowing
with the sort of glow that only a proud child could have. And then they
continued on with their drill. I then remember taking my leave at that point,
going to the staircase at the south end of the field (the field went from east
to west, so the south end would be the "away side" sideline, and the necks were
doing their drill running from east to west), and as I did, I remember running
across Jack, who told me I should join in. I then said something like, "no,
that's not my place," and moved on, but I also thought something to the effect
of, "and I don't want to steal that little girl's pround moment." as my joining
in in the same way she did would belittle her moment. So I walked down the
stairs, got in my car, started the engine, and began to drive off. That is when
I woke for real.

Now, I have talked about both of my dreams, and my prayers were answered.
Indeed, I would have honestly been very surprised had I not had any dreams last
night, as my mind was in such a state that I was sure I would have dreams, and
so it was the case. So far I have met the Adjudicator and the Tyrant.

So at this juncture, I feel it quite neccesary, quite neccesary indeed, to put
together my thoughts and feelings from the events of yesterday evening. Indeed,
as I said last night, when I prayed for dreams, I felt as though I needed to
put these things together in my head, and the dreams have provided a sort of
buffer, a way for me to process everything that happened last evening while
still keeping everything fresh in my head. And now it is time. At eleven
o'clock the following morning, it is time.

My weekend was mostly an uneventful one. I spent that Sunday making my way
towards B and N to purchase for myself, under the 2 for 10 discount, the Iliad
and the Odeyssey, and also the Metaphoses, all three of those along with
another book of my choosing. Indeed, when I got there, I saw also the divine
comedy of Dante, and considered purchasing that to fill out the collection, but
I also knew that I wanted to fill it out with some Dostoeyevsky or Tolstoy, so
instead I filled out the final purchase with the House of the Dead by Does.,
and I elected to return next weekend to purchase the divine comedy and fill out
that collection with something else.

All of this is to say nothing much, besides the fact that it was indeed one of
those days where you do things during the day that you have to bring yourself
to do lest you drive yourself mad in the stew of your own body odor and
disgustingness. Indeed, I had to take multiple quick showers that day, as my
tailbone still has not recovered from my ego, and the Chiro appointment that I
made the day previous is not to be fulfill until this afternoon, which I am
eagerly awaiting. This is the picture of my mind at this moment.

After purchasing some books at the store, I then went to the grocery to re up
myself on mushroom caps and avocado, and then I purchased a salmon filet to
fill my belly with. Indeed, I ate nearly a pound of salmon, and it felt as
though it did very little to satisfy my hunger, which I would have otherwise
filled with PBJ and other souch things that I have elected, as I have said, to
give up for the time being. So after purchasing a small ammount of groceries,
with my newly purchased books, I returned from the trip to both of these
stores, and I cooked up the fish quite well, if I say so myself, and finished
it.

And as I finished it, it was approaching the end of the work day, or at least
what would be the end of the work day if it were a work day, and I at that
moment was on the fence about visiting my father or not.

At this point, I find it important to say the state that I believed my father
to be in. I had received text messages from my mother about some nightmares he
was having, and some follow up MRI's and such, and I think the word aphesia was
in there as well but I don't know about what that means beyond the fact that it
means that hes is struggling to process things in some way. However, I did not
realize at all the state he was truly in, which will certainly be revealed as I
continue to write about my experince.

So I called my mother, and when she answered the phone, we shared our typical
hellos, and after a bit of a pause, one of us broke the silence, though I don't
remember which of us it was, and I made my intention known that I wished to
visit. And as I mentioned this, she mentioned to me that I should be aware that
there is "a lot of Aphasia" as she put it. And at this, she then said, "No, I'm
talking to Brett" and then she said that Dad was not sure what she was talking
about. This sort of interaction is the sort of typical interaction one would
have with someone who mistaked the conversation you would have on the phone
with someone who is not on the phone, and so I did not think very much of it at
that time, and I got in the shower breifly, dried myself off, got some clothes
on, and made my way to the hospital.

Approaching the hospital was nothing spectucular at all, the sort of typical
drive down the highway and onto the street. I will say I finally found my way
using the typical landmarks that I have found, and made my way to the parking
garage with familiarity that only comes after visiting a place multiple times.
This is in fact I think the fourth time I have visited him in this hospital,
and so I have become more familiar with how to get there.

Upon parking my car, exiting the vehicle, and walking my way to the elevators,
nothing of note happened. I continued up the elevators, and into the eleventh
floor, where I was then asked to fill out the questionaire that I have filled
out before, and I my temperature was scanned and I received my tag to place on
my breast. I will also make note that this is the first time I did not have to
ask which room he was in, I knew the room number to be 1127. However, upon
walking up to it, I saw something that I had not seen before, the door was
marked with all sorts of stickers indicating masks and gowns and gloves were
required before walking in, which I knew to be the case as my mother had told
me about that, but seeing them there made me second guess myself. I looked to
the room to the left, which did not have the stickers, but I trusted my natural
instinct for number rememberance, (and now I know I will never forget the
number 1127, as that is also the number of my jersey, with an eleven attached),
and I knocked on the door.

When I knocked, I heard voices from the inside, slightly muffled, that I knew
must have been the words of "come in" or some other such words. I made the
knock more out of formality and decency than anything else, as my plan was to
knock and proceed to open the door.

At this moment, I am briefly reminded of a moment, a moment in my memory eight
months ago, of my father first coming to the point of realization that "well, I
have Luekeimia". I don't know why I mention this now, inturrupting my flow of
thought, but the image came conjured up in my head, and I felt the need to
write it down.

Shifting back to the scene at hand, I knocked, heard voices, but before I heard
the voices I was already opening the door, and as I opened it I saw the scene
before me.

My father was lying on his side, on his left side facing the door, so I could
see him and his face as I walked in. I then also saw both Linda and Ann (my
mother, I don't know why I feel the need to call her Ann in this context)
sitting on the couch on the far side of the room, on each side of it, with a
space in the middle as though that were my proper space.

As I walked in, the first thing that struck me was my father. I said "Hello" or
"Hey" or "Hi" or other such lighthearted greeting, and was returned by hellos
and his from at least the women there. I don't recall if my father said hello,
but I do remember making eye contact with him in that moment, and he gave me a
wink. He winked at me multiple times at that moment (and indeed, many times
through the entire conversation) and I was only all too reminded of the image
of his late mother, my grandmother who I refer to as Grandma, who would wink in
a similar way in her old age when we would visit her. I did not visit her in
her state of dementia, as my father did repeatedly, but I in her old age, when
we would visit as a family, she would wink at us similarlarly, and Kyle and
Evan and I would remark about it. It always created a strange uneasiness in me,
as winking is not something that I was brought up to find a normal thing to do,
and winking is a peculiar gesture to me that I have never particualarly
enjoyed. Indeed, it must have something to do with my sense of honesty, as
winking almost always implies a sort of hidden connection between two
individuals that there is some secret shared between them and they each know it
and revel in it together in that gesture.

Well, as I stepped into the room, my father winked at me. I at first did not
return the gesture, and after saying hello, as I have already said, I maintaied
eye contact, and attempted my best smile towards my father. Well, my father
maintained eye contact with me, and continued to wink, at least three and
perhaps even four (although I am pretty certain it was three) times, before I
all at once gathered the nature of the situation and decided it would be the
best course of action to return the wink. So I returned the wink, at which
point I noticed a sense of satisfaction in his eyes, and he broke eye contact
and rolled a bit in bed.

He was noticably exhausted and tired, and you could tell he was making great
effort to keep his eyes open.

I then made my way to the couch, at which point I said hello to Linda and
shared the hugs between each lady there as would only make sense in such an
occasion. The convesation then was started by my mom mentioning that it has
been a while since we had seen eachother.

We all then took our seats, and we began to talk. I think the conversation was
really started by Linda, who asked the very natural and cordial, "what have you
been up to" question. I then replied that I was doing well, I mentioned Jiu
Jitsu and Work and Yoga and all of those things, and that topic of conversation
lasted the very appropiate twenty seconds that it should have. We then began to
talk as my father, who was very visiably tired, began to sleep. Or at least, he
gave the signs of having a nap as we sat there.

At this, my mother began to talk to me about the situation and state of my
father over the past few days. She told me that he had a nightmare on Thursday,
which she had told us about through text, and since then he has been sticken by
a pretty strong case of Aphasia. She told me what the current hypothesis is,
that he had some sort of stroke, and that it is unsure what may have caused it,
but that, due to his extremely compromised state that he is in right now, it
could have simply just been his blood not being entirely working correctly. She
told me that the doctors were in a sort of quandry, since all of the usual
medications to treat a stroke would not be applicable to him, since all of his
counts are out of whack already, and they are performing transfusions and such
to try and rectify that, but it's still very difficult to regulate it and the
usual blood thinners would not make any sense to apply, so they gave him some
sort of plaque breaker, but that it's unlikely to help anything really, and
that we can only pray that this stroke was a one off occurance.

Beyond that, she said that he has almost entirely lost all speech capabilities.
She said that he is aware of what is going on around him, and that she can tell
he is comprehending things, but that he is struggling to process things, and
mostly the only words he can say are things like yes and no, and a few others,
but that even at that he doesn't always get them correct. She mentioned also
that he has been having fits at times, and again I am reminded of my
grandmother, who I have heard, when asked questions, simple questions like do
you know your name, he would say "yes" in a resolute manner like "of course I
know my name" but that asked "what is your name?" he would have great
difficulty in coming up with it.

As my mother was describing this state to me, she said that it also goes in and
out, and sometimes he is able to say things more coherent than yes and no, but
those moments will come and pass, and sometimes he will fixate on a certain
phrase.

All of these things, I did not realize the extent of, and as I listened to my
mother talk about them, I did not feel as one might, worried about him. Indeed,
my mother even talked about how all of these things are reversable, and as she
said that I began to think to myself, "well of course they are reversable"
which I have no conception of in my head, but it's a matter of will more than
it is physical at this point, and I knew that.

In order to lighten the subject a bit, my mom then asked me to tell the story
about the Bovarian Grill, with the dinner between Papa and Granny and us three
grandchildren, and I began to tell the story, and got to the point where the
card was declined.

Then, something happened which I found quite remarkable, and which will stay
with me for quite some time. Indeed, this entire evening will stay with me for
quite some time, and writing it here is only being done so that I can remember
the details and the timeline of everything that happened. But what happened
next is the beginning of what will stick with me.

At that point, in the middle of my story, a doctor came in the room. I saw him,
and he was wearing his mask and gown and gloves and all of the things which are
required for anyone to wear before entering the room, and I did not recognize
him. Of course, that is not strange for me, as I don't know a lot of the
doctors, but what struck me as strange was the fact that he began to introduce
himself, first to my father, then to my mother who got up to meet him. He was a
Kidney doctor. So he walks up to my fathers bed, and begins asking him
questions. First he asked questions about who we were, and we each in turn gave
our names and our relation to my father. He then asked if it were okay if he
could ask a few questions while we were present, and my father said yes, it was
okay. He then asked some questions, things like what is your name, to which he
said Jerry Webster, and then where are you, to which he said UT Southwestern,
and maybe one other question, (not who is the president, because that was
something that Linda said they had asked him before and she had gained
solemn amusement at his response) to which he had the answer, before he then
asked if it was okay to take his pulse. My dad gave him permission, and the
doctor took his stethscope and used it to take my dad's pulse. Before he left,
he asked my father if he had any question for him, and my dad, at this point
was noticably distraught and confused, and looked at me, and I sort of
shrugged, and he turned back to the doctor and said no. Before the doctor left,
he asked about the port, asking "and what is this" and my mom answered that it
was a tri port that was put in. The doctor said that he just wanted to make
sure it was okay, and then he took his leave, removing his gloves and gown and
mask, and exited the room.

And at this point, I have to remind the reader that my father was having a very
difficult time communitcating at all, and there were times when he said phrases
like "for sure" and "no doubt" and this gave great satisfaction to my aunt and
mom who were both there, and said that that's the most he's said lately.

What happened next was astonishing. My father all at once was visibly confused,
remarkably so, and began asking things like "who was that" and "what just
happened" and simple questions like that. At that point, my mother and aunt did
a great job at explained that they were remarkably confused as well. He said
"I'm confused" at which both of them said almost in unison "we all are, that
was very confusing" and that gave him some comfort, but not entirely. He
continued to ask questions, and the women there continued to give their best
answers for him. My mother, who was standing by him up to that point, returned
to her chair, and when she returned there, something remarkable happened,
something which will always stick with me. In fact, it almost brings me to
tears at this moment just writing about it. I dare say that this moment will
make a sort of mark on me as a turning point in my own life and my own beleifs,
but it is too soon to say. All I can say now is that this moment was the moment
that hit me with a sort of profoundity (which I know is not a word) that I
could not help immediately have a sort of shift in myself.

My father began to speak, to himself. I will try to recreate it as accurately
as I can remember, but I know some bits will be missed. The areas around the
ellipses will be the points that will be the most uncertain. I will give the
parts that I know he said word for word after the entire thing.

"Dear god, in heaven. Please, help me... help me... (and at this point my mom
began to sit up and return to his side, and I placed my foot out to stop her
but she brushed by it) ... I am confused... bring me... (and at this point he
gave a pause noticably struggling to find the words that he wanted) ... help me
to understand what is going on. In Jesus name. Amen." and at the Amen, both my
mother and my aunt resounded with amen after that. And we all had a moment of
silence. And the parts I am sure of. I am sure he said Dear and heaven, and I
am not sure if he said Father or God, but I am pretty sure he said something to
that sytactical structure of Dear God, in Heaven.  Please was his next word.
What followed next was struggling, many pauses as he tried to find the words.
Then I know, after this stuggling he said his next phrase with clarity. Help me
to understand what is going on. Something very much like that, with the word
"understand" or a word like that, very close to that in syllabic difficulty.
That phrase followed by "in Jesus Name. Amen" all came out in succession
without inturruption.

This entire moment, as I said, had a profound impact on me. It was not until
that moment that I truly understood just how strong his faith is. It only makes
sense to me that a man so strong and steadfast as he would have a faith to
match, as I know his faith is important to him, but I did not see it, I had not
witnessed it, until that moment. What praticularly struck me in that moment was
that, in his so very compromised state, in the state of being where he has been
beaten, transfused, druged, injected with chemo, and brought to what could
possibly be his lowest point of physical well being, this is what he was able
to conjure up, the most words he had been able to put together since the
Aphesia started. And as I say, that moment struck me, and made an ever so
subtle shift in that conversation, and my treatment of that visit, from that
point on.

To fathom that only an hour before I was debating about whether or not I wanted
to visit! How great an error it would have been to fail in that moment, to have
decided to, instead of visit, continue with my idle tasks of lonesome
occupation. I may have missed this moment, this entire visit! How fickle this
thing we call life is.

Well, I do entirely forget what happened immediately after that. Indeed the
whole timeline of the visit is, even now only a day later, a bit muddled, but
what makes the most sense as to what happened would be at this point, my father
mentiond that he wanted to sleep. So we let him back to sleep.

Also, at this point, I finished my story at the Bovarian grill. Indeed, I don't
entirely remember how the two conversations interwove between eachother, but
that is that.

So that is the scene at this point, my dad, having made his prayer, returned to
sleep, and Linda and mom and I returned to our conversation, continuing talking
about medical things and my fathers conditions, and we were all uplifted a bit
at the fact that he was speaking more words than he had before, and that he was
seeming to much more easily put together his thoughts.

So after we three had conversed a bit, and my father continued to sleep, (there
was a bit of a shaking in his arm in his sleep that worried both my mom and my
aunt) at some point the nurse came in. At this, my father woke, and there was a
bit of back and forth about having a sponge bath, and cleaning my father (who
is mostly incontinent at this point) and some back and forth about "sure, go
ahead and do it" and "no I'd rather sleep" we decided to leave the room while
the nurses did their sponge bath and cleaning duties.

So now, at this point in the hall, we had the conversation in the hall. There
are a couple things to remark about this conversation. The first and primary
has to do with the sequence of events, and the second which I will talk about
first was the meeting of the nurse Payton. Payton, a nurse whose name I know
because last time I visited she was mentioned as a good nurse, whose name we
can remember "like the football player" as my dad said only a week ago was
walking through the hall just as we happened to be visiting. She saw my mom,
and asked how he was doing, to which my mom said, "not as well as we would
hope" at which Payton, being a good nurse that she is, immediately understood
and asked "may I give you a hug" The nurse and my mom shared a hug, and Payton
said, "I hope I am not overstepping my bounds but I am praying for you." And my
mom said, "no of course, not at all, and thank you." and the nurse went on
through the hall to wherever she was going. I mention this only because it was
the trigger for my crying moment which happened later in the car, which will be
described in its proper place.

The first thing had to do with the sequence of events. So I prefaced this by
mentioning that I visited my father the week before, and he was, while
certainly beaten down by the events, he was very lucid and we had a very nice
conversation while I was there, which I talked about in an earlier article. I
then mentioned that I know you my mother mentioned nightmares, but I didn't
realize exactly what state he was in, and I wanted a timeline of events. So my
mom told me about the nightmare which happened Thursday evening, which she
described as him being in the desert, wanting to get everyone out, all of us,
he needed to get everyone out, and he couldn't move on from the desert until he
did, and he woke up and Linda described that he was parched, absolutely
parched, which was because of the dialysis of his kidneys he was not supposed
to drink as much water, but she gave him some water and comforted him, and the
fitfullness of that night is some time around when they think he had the
stroke. The aphasia has been present since then. I then asked when Linda first
started taking care of him, and she said it was that very same night, and
immediately without thinking, I said in jest "So you triggered it" at which I
immediately realized that my jest probably had quite a lot of truth in it, and
Linda immediately replied that she probably did, and that seeing her there, him
being confused at having her there, and etc, were giving him a strong sense
that he was on his death bed. And she wanted just one good night, and so far
she was 0-3, and she just wants one good night with him while she is there.

Well, that was the two most important things of that conversation in the
hallway. I swear at this rate I will never be able to say what I want to say in
the time I have, but I will continue to do my best. Writing is hard and I am
thankful that I have begun this endeavor.

So, we got word from the nurses that we could return, and so we did. Shortly
after returning, we continued to interact with my dad, and I remember him
mentioning that he had to pee, and after some mild difficulty in communication,
my mom asked if she should get the urinal, and he replied that yes, she should,
and she got the urinal, and I looked away, and I knew that he was able to pee
in the urinal, which seems like such a minor thing, but seemed like a victory
to me, since they wanted to get some urine from him for testing and that they
were able to get some was a good thing.

Shortly after this, my mom made her goodbyes, making sure that it was okay with
my dad before she did, and both mom and Linda made sure that he was okay with
that before she left. I had a moment where I thought about seeing her out, but
I decided it best to stay there with my father for the time, and to go and see
my mom on my way out of the hospital entirely.

So my mom made her leave, as I said, and at this point it is just me and dad
and Linda in the room. And pretty soon after my mom left, my dad said something
like, after saying that he was sure that he was okay with my mom getting some
rest, said something like "I just having this feeling like, everything is good,
and I'm done" and he trailed off on the words "I'm done".

And at this point something happened which will again stick with me forever.
Indeed this entire night will stick with me forever, but this is another
moment. As soon as he trailed off with "I'm done" my immediate impulse was "I
wonder what he means by I'm done right now" since words, espically words like
"I'm done" can have so many different meanings in different contexts, and I was
curious what he train of thought might have gone to, but Linda immediately
started to go off on "no your not done, you still have quite a lot and we all
love you" and etc etc, and all of those sorts of things which I won't try and
begin to detail out here since I could not do the ramblings of a woman justice.
Ramblings of women that they have such an uncanny ability to overwhelm you with
and take you with and make you so overcome with almost awe as you lose your
sense of presence and their words and sounds almost become like noise, noise
that you can hear and comprehend but at the same time come into the ears as a
sort of white noise that become drowned out into a realm of processing that I
can't even begin to fathom. No, I will not try and recreate the words she said,
but suffice it to say, the principle thing was, in this conversation (and
praise be to women for this, because without it she would not have sparked this
moment between my father and I which led to the kiss which I will never forget)
my father asked her "are you worried" which set her off on another one of these
ramblings about her worry and she is only worried if he is worried, and she
talked with Doctor V who told her this and that about his condition, and that
this is a hard time, and so on and so on, and she ended up asking him in the
whole thing if he was worried. And when she asked that, he looked at me,
directly and unmistakably at me, and we made eye contact (I had been looking at
him this whole time, but our eyes finally met here) and asked me "are you
worried." And I smiled, and said the most resolute, the most peaceful and
genuitne "no" that I have ever said in my life. Worry was not in me at all in
that moment. And at this, my father replied to Linda, "Then I am not worried".
And at this Linda somewhat began to continue her speech, but mostly concluded
with "well I'm glad, that's good" in her most womenly way.

I then said something which was great in that moment. I said, "women have a
tendancy to worry." At first this was heard as "You have a tendance to worry."
and my father asked "I do?", and I said, "No, not you, wo-men" and I
articulated out the word like that to be sure I was understood correctly. At
this, something miraculous happened. My father laughed. He laughed the sort of
laugh that I know him for, the laugh that I have heard all through my
childhood, through my youth and my teenage years and even the years I hated
him. He laughed that genuine laugh that I inherited from him. And I laughed
with him, that inherited laugh, him and I together, and he said "my brother, my
brother" and he held out his fist to give me a fist bump and I sat up and
returned the bump, and he said "Thank you" "Thank you" as if I had lifted from
him something that he only wished he could articulate but needed me to do it
for him. And at this Linda said, "Well, I will try not to be offended" and she
took her place in the seat. And I added on, "well, we love you for it anyway."
and my father agreed with an "amen to that".

That was a sort of turning point to the whole visit. I think it was at this
moment, that we had a few fleeting conversations. One was about golf, that had
been playing on the tv this whole time, and Linda said she recognized one of
the names, and I said the only female golfer I know is Anica Sorrenstein, who I
think doesn't play anymore. And then I mentioned also "and of course, Julie
Pyne," and this got a smile out of my father who I was glad recognized the
name.

Another conversation had to do with fireworks. I asked if he got to see the
fireworks, and my father said yeah, and then I asked him how the view was, and
he said it sucked, (my mom had said the the fireworks on the fourth happened
behind a building and they couldn't see them, but the ones on the third
happened in plain view, so I thought maybe he would recall those and not the
foruth ones, but I was mistaken) and to that I said, "well, what can you do"
and my father said "nothing" and I said that's right.

I don't remember the exact timeline of this, but my father then asked me how it
was that I wasn't worried. To this I replied simply that I am not. He then
began to say something like "Well, that's good to me, because I am not either,
but I have this strong feeling like I am sitting here, and I am happy, and I'm
here, and I feel like, it's over" and that he said with a final period on it,
and thank god Linda had the wisdom to see the moment between he and I there,
and she remained silent. He then asked me, "do you not feel that". And I said I
don't. But then I added on "But it's not in my hands, and its not in your
hands, its in the hands of ..." and at this I paused, I wanted to say the
universe, I wanted to say "that which is beyond us" but both of those things I
knew were not phrases that he could understand, and after the pause (which was
ever so breif) I said "it's in God's hands what happens here."

And truely I tell you, from this moment forward in the conversation, we
maintained eye contact. He said, "yes its in the hands of God," and I said
right. And he continued like that, and we maintained eye contact, uncomfortable
but unwavering eye contact, and we continued on this conversation, which was
probably way shorter than I remember, because truely let me tell you that this
moment, this connection between my father and I felt to last for an entire
eternity, if you forgive the cliche. It felt like time stood still and we hung
there, each seeing the truth in the eyes of the other. But I'm only human, and
I was still uncomfortable with my use of the word god, and my father saw that,
he saw that there was a smile, and he asked me to speak my thoughts. And I
said, "I just, I think you don't know that what I say is genuine" and we
struggled on the word genuine for a bit, but I repeated it slowly and he got
it, and he said he knew it was, and that he was glad that I was right with God.
And I replied that he asked me to speak my thoughts. Finally, Linda
inturrupted, while my dad and I maintained eye contact, and she gave her two
cents about God and how this is in God's hands, and such and such, but dad and
I looked at eachother, and I stayed fixed on his gaze.

Then I started to see through him, see him like glass, (from my journals in
seattle, the man who wanted to join the army, what he said to me when we made
eye contact in that moment), and I saw his stare start to widen. I maintained
the eye contact, until I gave him a wink, at that I can only say it was because
I felt that such a long prolonged manner of eye contact had to be uncomfortable
at some point no matter how profound a moment precipitated it, and I broke the
contact (indeed, his gaze probably broke before I broke contact). And then he
said something like, "I don't know what to do now, maybe sleep." To which I
replied, "Or maybe eat". "Yes, or maybe eat." and then I said, "Or maybe watch
golf." and he said "No, not that" and looked away, not at the TV but just away.

So I sat there for another few moments, but I had seen the moment, it had
passed, and I took notes from my previous visit to make then, so I stood up,
and looked at my father, and announced my intention to leave "Well, I think I'm
going to leave now" or something equally as cumbersome. I stepped up to my
fathers bedside, and he raised his hand out to me, a gesture which even in his
weakest state he continues to make for me, and I took his hand and held it. And
at this, I began to bow my head to him, at first to his shoulder, but then I
felt how strange that gesture was, so I began to move my lips, covered by the
mask, towards his forehead to kiss him, but hesitated as I realized he was
pursing his lips to kiss me, and we met somewhat in the middle, and breifly,
between the safety of the mask, we kissed eachother on the lips. For the first
and only time, we kissed on the lips. We exchanged I love you's, and I ended by
saying, "You told you me would get better" to which he said "I will" and I said
"Good." I removed my hand, and I hugged Linda who was there, and she said
"You're a good man Brett" and I said "Thank you" in response, but also in a way
thanking her, and we shared I love yous. And I made my way. I took a bow as I
left the room, and made my way down the hall, in a state of nearing tears.

As I went down the elevator, I determined that this was not the spot to let
myself break into tears. It was not, and I knew it when the doors opened on
floor 6 and I had this moment where no one got in, and I held the door open,
seeing a family out there in the hall of floor 6, and after holding it for a
good twenty seconds, the mom there said "you can go" and I resumed going down.

When I made it to my car, I remember having a resolve to go to my mom. I
quickly thought through the best route to get there, and started my engine and
made my way out of the garage. Needless to say my head was spinning with
thoughts, and I was on the verge of tears, but knew they wouldn't come if I
tried to conjure them, so I let myself drive in that state. My thoughts at this
point are not worth noting here as they are the same thoughts I am detailing
out just now. I played through the whole visit, in it's pieces, and I thought
through the conversation I knew I would have with my mom. I thought about her
attachments, of her worries, and all of that, and knew that that is what the
conversation would have to come to.

Also on the road, I got a very strange imagary of the signage there, I thought
about how deplorable the advertising was, as if our super organism had produced
this, and how despisable it was. Regardless, I saw this in all the sort of
beauty that I have been trying to see all things of late, and I let it pass as
you have to let such beauty pass. I just saw the signs similar to the way I saw
them on mushrooms, but without the out of body experience of psychodelics.

And, as I was on the interchange from 635 to 75, I thought about Payton, the
nurse. I thought about her soul, what I great soul it was, and I thought about
a hypothetical conversation that I could have with her about my father, about what she saw in
my father, and what it was that made her so attached to him and my mother. And
as I was thinking about that conversation, in my humanness, in my baseness, I
played out very quickly the fantasy that maybe her and I would connect and we
could date and that would be how I would meet "her" the "her" of my life. And
all of this was quite innocent, but then I thought, in comparison to my father,
why would she be interested in someone like me, someone so wretched and
contempable as myself. And at that, it let loose. The tears flew as I came down
that interchange. That word "contempable" stuck in my mind, as the word that
triggered it. I had to manage the emotions of my tears with my duties as a
driver. I did not seek to stop the tears as I only knew that would make it
worse, and so I drove and merged and breathed and let the tears flow. I let it
all flow through me, in the silence of my own car, I let the tears flow on
their own, and I only thought about not rear-ending the car in front of me or
making sure to check my blind spot as I merged. And on the highway, I saw a
man with a broken down car on the side of the road, and thought maybe I should
seek to be a good samaritan and stop, but then I thought "what could a wretched
unhandy fool like me do to help this man, he would be better off if I didn't
stop and he probably had AAA or a friend or someone already on the way, and I
can't help him," and that only made the tears flow more. And I knew I was in a
severely compromised driving state, so I focused on the safety of the road
above all else. And there was a moment, when I wanted to get infront of a car
before turning right, but I thought, "why should I get in front of him?" He is
already in front. Who am I to get in front of this car only to slow him down as
I turn? So I slowed myself to his speed, and got behind him, and made my turn
towards the street that leads to my parents house from the highway. And in that
two mile stretch of surface road, I gathered myself back together, let the last
of the tears flow out, and turned to my neighborhood road, and parked where I
do outside my parents.

Upon arriving at my parents, I heard my mom talking to what I correctly
assumed was Granny and Papa on the phone, so I made my way into the kitchen,
opened the fridge, and found some pulled BBQ that I took out, showed to her to
ask if I could eat some, to which she said yes, and I put some in a bowl and
ate it. I saw some mashed potato mix on the counter as well. After eating the
beef I waited for my mom to get off the phone, and said that after we ate, I
wanted to take her on a walk. I then went into Evan's room, and just made my
appearance. He was watching a speed run from SGDQ, but he paused it and came
out when I showed up. We ate some food, and the only really notable thing that
happened at this dinner, besides having cordial conversation as one might
in such a situation, was that, when I went to clean all of the dishes, I
started cleaning them all out, and the disposal wasn't draining properly. That
is something that I know has happened before, and could be cleared out with a
snake if it doesn't clear properly, but I don't know how to use a snake, and
was always one of those things that dad would handle, but of course he wasn't
there, and I dare not say anything of the sort, and mom brought out a business
card of a plumber that she knew that she might call to fix it, and I felt that
somehow that that was wrong but didn't know how to feel about the whole thing.

After we had finished, we then returned to the topic of the walk, and my mom
asked if this is the sort of walk that Evan would be invited to. I then said
no, at which point we then went back and forth about Evan feeling rejected and
such, and I gave him a hug and said I did feel bad, but that I wanted to walk
on our own. Evan gave me a hard time about it of course, but that was how I
wanted it to be. My mom then asked me if it would be a hard walk, and I said no
even though I knew that probably wasn't the case, but yeah.

Anyway, as we started the walk, I mentioned the tire that is flat on my back
right of my car, and that I had ulterior motive for coming here, that I wanted
to use the air compressor. So we made note of that to resolve it after the
walk. We then stared, and I honestly don't remember how the entire walk
started. By the time we got to Drake and Tulane though, only 200 meters in, I
had managed to move the conversation to where I wanted it. In fact, I think it
started with us talking about the rest of the visit, which led right in to
where I wanted it to go. And I said this.

I had never seen it before, but I saw it now, and I know it to be true. Dad's
faith is strong, and it's his faith that will get him through this. And I told
my mom that I mean that, that I'm not just saying it, but that I really do
truely believe that. I then went on to talk about my thoughts on God, and
religion, and I said it is undeniable that there is something of truth in it,
but that because of that it has been polluted, polluted by greedy and corrupt
people, talking about the church, and the bible, and everything that people
say. And I made clear that while I think things like the 6000 years or the fact
that some being snapped his fingers and it all came in a poof is absurd, but
that still there is a truth in the concepts, of God, of Faith, of Sacrifice and
surrender. Those are all powerful things, and that I never realized, never
witnessed, just how strong it is in dad.

To this, we then talked back and forth a bit about the whole topic. To be
totally honest, I thought I would have more to say about this right now as I am
writing, but I don't. But we got to a point in the conversation where we had a
sort of breaking point, after the 1000 meter mark on our 1600 meter path, where
I asked my mom and I asked her if I could ask a personal question. She said
sure, and I asked her, when she prays, and I know you do because I know you,
what do you pray for. And at this she said that she isn't always sure of what
to pray for, sometimes she prays for healing, and other times she prays for
gods will. And after the 1200 meter mark, when she had sort of finished about
those things regarding my father, I asked what she prays about when she prays
about herself. And she said she prays for his wisdom, and that she prays for
her judgemental attitude (which surprised me honestly) and that she prays for
gods will to come in her, and to protect her. And at that, as we were nearing
the end of the walk, I asked if she ever prays for surrender. And I prefaced at
that point, saying that I don't want to come off as some sort of righteous
fool, as if I have all the answers, and she said I wasn't and that yes, she
does. I then mentioned that something that comes from eastern philosphy,
because there is truth in Eastern philosophy as well, and a concept that is
also prevalent throughout Christanity, is about letting go of attachments,
letting go of worldly things that we hold on to, and surrendering yourself to
our own mortality, because that is the fate of all things, is our mortality.
And I said that I see her, the love she has for everything, but I also see
attachment, that she has very strongly, and at this she recoiled a bit, and
said that yes, that is something she thinks very strongly about, and that she
was a bit surprised that that was what was on my mind. And as we rounded the
corner back into the backyard, I said that dad's faith will get him through
this, but also your faith will as well, and that I pray that she should pray
for her surrender, that she might let go of her attachment to her own worry and
anxiety, that she may trust whatever "God's plan" may be. And she told me that
she does, and that eased my heart, and I told her that.

When we circled back into the backyard, we wrapped up our disscussion rather
quickly with me describing my dreams the dreams I had. The moment that struck
me the most was, and what took me a few minutes to articulate in the backyard
was, that my felony charge arrived I think at a very ideal time. That the
situation of it was as ideal as it could have been, that I got caught in Denton
and not in Trinidad, that I had that day off of work already, that I'm not
addicted to marijuana nad can easily stop smoking, that I have the income to
pay for a lawyer who can get it expunged, that everything lined up so
perfectly. And in as much as I believe in a "God's plan" (and I used air quotes
describing it to my mom), that charge must be a part of "God's plan" because
when I smoke marijuana, I don't have dreams, but now that I am not smoking, I
am having dreams again, beautiful dreams, and dad is in these dreams, and he is
perfectly well. Now I said that I don't know what that means, because it could
very easily just mean that my memories of dad are from when he is well and that
that could be all that this means, but without the felony charge, I would be
smoking marijuana again, and I wouldn't be having these dreams.

At that, we shared our hug, the long hug that we had to share in that moment,
and after that hug I said that I wanted to write a caring bridge post. I still
need to write it, and will after my chiropracter appointment. Regardless, we
swapped the cars, and I put air in the tire. I then returned inside, washed my
hands, and shared our final conversation of concluding words with mom and Evan
inside, as I shared my final thoughts. In those final thoughts, I mentioned
to treat every moment in the hospital with dad as if he is there. Don't talk as
if he isn't there. My mom then said that, well, that's what we were doing, and
I wasn't so sure, but she got a little defensive at that, and I receded,
calling myself a righteous fool again, before we shared our final hugs for that
day and I drove back to my place.


Caring Bridge Post

So lately I have felt inspired to write here about my father, partly to give
some relief to my mom, who has been amazingly supportive of my father in this
journey, and has been the sole informant as to his well being towards the
world, but also because I feel driven by something inside me to speak to
everyone who might be so compelled to listen. Call it the Holy Spirit if you
like, or choose to leave it unnamed as I do, whatever it is compells me to
speak about my father.

It's easy to read these posts, and to get updates on Jerry's health, and to
read it as "we did such-and-such treatment on so-and-so day and Jerry's
condition is X, Y and Z" when really there is so much more underlying what is
going on. We can talk about his physical condition, and label it it however we
like, (and it is true, that from a pragmatic stance his current state is not
well) but when it comes the actual condition of my father, I have visited him,
and I can see that he is not defined by his physical state. He is much more
than that, and he always has been, and I've known that to be true. It's
easy to disregard that, and put it behind the shield of good health, but when
that good health leaves us, we are left with our barest being, or naked soul,
to be judged before god, what is left of my Father I see to be an unshakable
faith.

In all of this, in all of the transfusions, chemotherapy, and a bunch of other
things, when a man is striped down to his basic he is left to face the rapture
and gates of Hell, and in that, I what is left of my father is his faith, and
his love of his family. Both of those things are what is left of him of him at this
compromised physical state, and I know it in my heart that if he can make it
through this, it will be his faith that pulls him through.

I am one that is can so easily get caught up in the facts of things to
disregard the truth, the truth that deep down in all of us there is this
undeniable thing we all share, and that thing gets lost in the turmoils of life
and the stresses of the world, but when faced with the greatest stress, when we
are all brought to the mortality that we all share, I see in my father a faith
which is strong, and if anything will bring him through to the other side of
this a reborn man, it is his faith.

I don't know how this ends, but no matter what I know that he is able to find
peace in his faith and in the love of everyone that cares for him.

None of us know what will the end result of this thing we call life, and it's
never about the destinations that we reach, but the steps that we make on the
journey. The thing is, most of us have the luxury of being able to  However,
most of us have the luxury of 
truth in it that we all share.

This entire
journey, this past eight months since the first diagnosis, is reaching a sort
of climax, and in that, none can say what will be the end result, but currently
I am compelled, perhaps by the Holy Spirit if those words mean anything to you,
to give a sort of fresh perspective. It's easy to see these posts, and see that
"such and such" treatment happen at "so and so" time and Jerry is responding in
xyz way to it, and in those details get lost in the moment and forget that this
entire thing is one big journey, and in this journey, how are we?  And that's
the whole thing for all of us, the journey of life that we all step through.
It should never be about the end destination, as much as we want to be able to
say words like "remission" and "cured", similar to words like "promoted" and
"happily retired" as a lot of us strive for, it's important to remember that
the end destination is never the goal.

I have visited my father, and, pragmatically speaking, if narrowing in on this
moment he is not well, but I can also say, with complete certainty, that these
steps that my father is on at this stage in his journey, he is taking with a
strength, with a faith, and a surrender to the will of God that, while I knew
it to exist to him, I have been so fortunate to witness. And in witnessing
that, I see that know matter what the end result of this entire journey is for
him, his steps, and his strength along this journey 

So I don't know how many people read this, or how many that do even know who I
am, but lately I have been inspired to write here about my father, and I asked
my mom who said she would post it if I did, so here it goes

I have felt inspired to write here about my dad, because I know a lot of these
posts can be about "a certain treatment happened today and this is how it went"
or about medical conditions, or other such things about the physical condition
of the state of my father, and I don't want to talk about that. Being informed
there is important, but among all of the numbers and the treatments, you can
still get lost in the details and still be left wondering "so how is he?"

I have recently visited my father, on what was day +12 of the bone marrow
transfusion, and you can say from a purely pragmatic standpoint he is not
well, but I can say I have seen something in him that I didn't know was there
and that I do truely firmly believe. When you strip him of his physical body,
take away his capabilities, beat him down with the potent and destructive drug
that is chemo, on top of all the other drugs they put in him to regulate
all of things we need in this thing we call life, and when take all of that
from him so that his physical body, strong though it is, is reduced to an
entire ecosystem of chemicals at war with itself, when you do all of that, what
remains in him is a strength, a strength that I have always known is there, but
did not truely appreciate until I was able to take witness to it, and see it in
his eyes. His strength, his faith in God, his love for those that love him,
those things are what's left, in their most bare and raw form, and seeing that,
I can say without doubt that his faith, if it's allowed to stay alive within
him, will bring him through this. I know that to be true. I never knew how
strong it was. I knew, but I had not truely seen witness to it. It's a
powerful force, and it will bring him through this, if it's allowed to flourish
like it needs. I truly believe that.


when he has been reduced to immeasurable rapture and suffering due to the
horrible (but unfortantely still our best known method) drug His faith is
there, and it is perhaps the strongest thing in him, his faith and his love for
those who love him, when all his bodily capabilities are taken away, and he's
taken down and reduced to.

Wow, what a mess of thoughts, I came into this post with the best of
intentions, but now I see that I must come back to it with a clearer mind. I
will return to this later, and from there see what it is I should do, to find
my inner spirit and let it write through me.

# 20180710 Chiropractic care - Discovery of the Hermit
So today I don't have nearly as much to talk about as I did yesterday.
Obviously yesterday I had a lot to talk about about two days ago, and I think
the biggest thing I can say is that I don't think that the Caring Bridge post
will make the statement that I want it to make. I reflected on it a bit, and I
think that my ego is still trying to greatly to make a point, and my own agenda
is coming through in the post, which isn't fair, and doesn't make sense. So for
the time being, I think I will pass on making a post.

I know I had some sort of fleeting dream yesterday, but it wasn't significant
enough for me to remember it or even if I did it would be one of those dreams
that just sorta is there and I wouldn't dwell on it too much.

So I think the starting point for my disscussion today will be of my experience
with the chiropractor. So yesterday I had my first visit, and we went through a
lot of tests, I mentioned what happened, he checked my reflexes, he asked me if
I hurt when I moved in certain ways, and etc. After that initial assessment, we
took some x-rays of the hip area, and after that we went back to the table
where he gave me an adjustment. The adjustment was not exactly what I was
anticipating (or rather, not as much as I was anticipating). We only did three
things, first was the neck adjustment, which happened way quicker and way
easier than I thought it would be. I expected that to feel like some divine
angel had come from heaven and given blessings to neck, but really after he did
my foremost thought was "oh, that was it, huh". Next, he did the thing where
you put your arms across your shoulder blades, in front, and you sit up, and as
you sit back, he will press against your back towards the thoracic area, and
extend out everything in there. That felt good, although again, not nearly as
good as I thought it would. Then he did the thing where you lay on your back,
put your leg out to the side, and you twist your back. First he did it to the
left leg (right side) then to the other side. That was the most interesting
adjustment. After that, he asked my to lie down on my stomach, and he hooked up
two electrode, one to the top of my ass cheek and the other along the low back,
and he started it and told me when to stop. He got to a certain point and said
that he didn't feel comfortable going anymore, but I assured him that I was
okay. Mostly, it was just sending electrical impulses through those muscles,
and they conctracted involuntarily, and I tried to do my best to not resist
tensing up because of it. He then left me there for twenty ish minutes, after
putting an ice pack on the area, and I lay there for a while just letting my
back and ass contract involuntarily for that time. When he came back, the
electric therapy didn't seem to do much if we're being totally honest about it,
but whatever. Finally he gave me his diagnosis, which was that I had probably
sprained a ligament, which as soon as he said it my mind went through to
reactions. First was, "wait, muscles in your back have ligaments too?" which I
then thought "well of course" and then I thought, "Yeah, that makes way more
sense then a pulled muscle, and is consistent with my experience of sprained
ankles." So all of that reassured me, and I left feeling now exactly relieved
but pretty good about the whole thing.

Well, I went again this morning, and he showed me the x-rays that were taken,
and to be honest I feel quite enlightened now, for I saw something that I knew
to be true but never knew exactly how it was true. That is, in what I used to
express as, "my hips are fucked up due to lunging to one side all the time in
ultimate" I could actually see where the point in the front where the left hip
meets the right hip is mal-aligned. He said basically the "top" of my right hip
is further up than it should be, and the left side of the base of my hips,
where my ball sack comes out of (my words not his of course) is lower than my
right. And seeing that x-ray, I instantly was enlightened, because now I can
say, "I have seen my hips, and they are fucked up because of ultimate" but now
I can say my "Pubic sympysis" (a word I just had to look up and will take me
some time to remember) is out of line. He then had me, with both of my feet on
the floor, press inward to his hands, and my hip popped, my Pubic Sympysis (I
swear I'm just going to call it my ballsack joint) popped, in a place that I
have never felt it pop before, which was a beautiful feeling. I walked out of
that office feeling as though, this thing is not better, but I know now just
exactly how my hip is fucked up, and I know it what way I need to strengthen
myself and re-allign myself in order to fix it. He then gave me some stretches
to do with my hips, and the entire thing is very helpful.

So this is what I will say about chriropractic care. It should be the first
resource anyone should seek for things of this nature. I am not educated enough
to say which sorts of issues could be corrected with chiropractic care, and
which sorts of issues require more intense care, but like all things, I have
discovered it for myself, and I know when chiropractic care will work for me
when I have issues. I am more educated about my hip now, and the efforts I have
been making in order to correct them I can now perform with resolution. I have
narrowed down exactly what is wrong (indeed, I have been focusing on my left
hip socket vs my right hip socket rather than the ball sack joint all this
time) and so I am honestly very excited to get this piece of shit hip back in
its place.

So now that I have spent a good twenty five minutes writing down things of
little consequence, I do sort of want to try and discovery write some of my
characters for my story. I could try and finish the Dragon and the King story
also, but this I feel more inspired to do in this moment, so I will do that
instead.

So I think what I have sort of left off on was this. This story will take place
in it's own world, with it's own religion, and I want it to remain mostly
seperate from the current world with it's religion as much as possible. In
fact, as I said, I feel it neccasary to give at least some notion of "from the
author" about this story, because the concept of life having a meaning I feel
can only work in so far as this single short story is concerned. I am not so
concerned about delving into the mythology of this world, nor am I concerned
with the exact teaching of the hermit, or his visions. Mostly, the two most
important points are this. First, the hermit tells of a vision of the nature of
the universe, and maybe even the afterlife, that are unambiguous, and that are
in contradiction in some ways with the dogmatic view of Christianity. In fact,
I want my athiest character to say something like "If there were a god,
wouldn't he give us a crash course on the universe before he just threw us
here?" and I want that question to be answered in this mythology. Second, is
that there must be some sort of prediction about the doings of these four,
undeniably so, so that there is no question that this prediction indeed a
foretelling of these events. What I don't like about this is that it brings in
to the story the notions of pre-destination and free-will, and I don't that
question to be unambigous, (rather, I want that question to remain ambiguos) in
this mythology, so in order to get around that, I will have to some reason why
the predictions of hermit don't enforce the notion of pre-destination.

As I think through all of this, I think what I need is for this god of this
mythology to be not omni-potent, not omniscient, and not all of the omni
things. In fact, what I think I want is for the hermit to relay all of those
things in his message. I can also answer the question of, "well why does not
god just reveal himself to us in a straightforward way" by saying that this god
does not have the capability to do so, and very much wishes that he did.

The visions of this hermit need to be associated with some sort of traumatic
event. I don't have experience with epilepsy, but an epileptic fit would work,
but as I said I don't feel comfortable writing about such a thing and would
like to come up with a new reason. I like the idea of mushrooms, but I don't
like that because mushrooms have too much of an association with "hippies" and
"stoners" who claim to see god during their trips, and my reader might say
something like "so you went on a mushroom trip and you saw god and you decided
to make a story about it, huh?" And not only am I concerned with the concept of
mushrooms cheapening the story, but it also would be a discredit to the power
of mushrooms. Mushrooms are about way more than simply "I ate mushrooms and I
had a vision of how the universe is, and it is exactly like this" and that is
what this stupid story is claiming to be, and I don't want to give mushrooms
that sort of name, I respect the psilosybin too much.

So instead, I think I like this version of the story. This hermit, who lived in
isolation for a great time, was in the middle of a great fast, but during his
fast, something supernatural happens which destroys his natural food source. In
his fasted state, he decides to go out into the woods where he stays, to gather
some food, but maybe it's winter, and all of the natural food sources are
exhausted, so he goes out to hunt, but while he is hunting, he gets attacked by
an animal. And after he is attacked. Perhaps in his struggle he is able to fend
off the animal, but he is greatly wounded, and as he attempts to return to his
camp, he grows weaker and weaker, attempting to conjure up his energy to make
it back to his hut to where he has some emergency supplies that he has with him
in his hermatage, but he isn't able to make it, and collapses in the woods
where he believes he is doomed to die. It is at this point that he has this
vision.

I don't know exactly yet what I want this vision to be. Part of me wants to
avoid the typical "am I dead" schitck, but I'm not sure if I can avoid it.
Regardless, I don't think I want to dwell on, in this moment, what exactly the
vision is of. Mostly, I want him to meet god there, I want him to witness some
of the afterlife, and I want god to give him instructions on what to do when he
gets back. I certainly want there to be a manifestation of the afterlife in
this vision. Also, I certainly want this god to have created the universe, but
I want him to explain that he can't interact with it once he has created it.
Also, I want his visions of this god to be amorphous, perhaps even shifting,
and for this god to say that his perception of what he is will change as he
experiences him. So perhaps at first he might be a voice in the sky, then he
might be a goddess, then he might be an encapsulation of his soul, and then a
glowing light, and etc. and I can use this sort of imagary to create a neat
effect in the story. But like I said, I am not quite ready to discover that
portion of the story yet, and I am still bouncing around ideas in my head about
it.

Regardless, after witnessing the afterlife, and knowing it to be real, I want
three things to be given to this man as a result of this vision. The first will
be the promise of recovery and good health, in the form of something
ridiculous, like maybe an entire medical kit that would be wholly implausible
to appear. I don't like that idea as much, but maybe he will restore his crops
in his area, that seems more plausible. And I like that because it could be
interpreted as the hermit, in his fasted state, had merely hallucinated the
garden being torn over or something like that, but it is also something I want
to say that all of these things I want the dogmatic athiest to be able to come
up with a plausible reason why the entire thing is false.

The next thing I want is some sort of prediction, first a few general
predictions, with a timeline of events for when they occur, (with perhaps some
inconsistencies since this god is, as I said, imperfect). I want the god to tell the
hermit about these four characters, about how they all know eachother, and to
give some sort of background about all of them that only they could know. That
is why I like the idea of a murder, because that is something that they would
all for sure keep secret. In fact, when they begin to read the papers, the
dogmatic athiest could begin to accuse someone of out him (as I want him to be
the primary driver of the murder) and that this was some kind of cruel trick or
game or something else.

The last thing I want is for some way for them to prove without a doubt that
these things are real. I have just come up with an idea for this. At some very
specific place and time, I want it to be the case that maybe gravity can be
reversed, but only at a specific place and time (since this is all the god can
do, is coarsely play with the rules of the universe, rather than manipulate the
object within), and I want my characters to go to this specific place, and find
the entire thing, set apart and marked by the hermit, which is in a cave in a
distant area in the remote north which no one ever visits, (and not because
there are rumors about it or anything like that, but because the place is so
remote, and uninteresting that no one would visit there) and I want them to
witness something such as the reversal of gravity there (I would like to come
up with some better than that, but I can't think of something right now off the
top of my head). Whatever it is that they witness, it has to be something that
could not be mistaken for anything else but a miracle.

As I have been writing this, also, I have come up with this notion, an answer
two the question of "why doesn't this god just reveal himself to us" and I want
it to be the case that in the past he has. This is just an idea, and I don't
know how much I like it now that I think about it, but I could perhaps tie
things like stonehenge, the ressurection of Jesus, the pyramids, the prophesies
of Mohammed, and others, into this thing of this god trying to communicate his
existance to us.

I suppose, to, if I were to go this route, there should be some reason why this
god wants to try and communicate with us. Maybe he sees our misgivings, and he
is trying to steer us in a better direction. I just now had the idea of maybe
this entire universe is like a science project that he is being graded on, and
he wants to be able to communicate with us in order to get a better grade on
his universe. That notion is extremely childish, but this entire thing is quite
absurd. Even so, I don't like that idea as to his motivation for trying to
communicate with us. Maybe he just made this thing as his sort of toy, because
he was bored, and he wanted to play with something, so he made this universe,
but he had no idea how it was going to go, and when he saw it begin to explode
before his eyes, he wants to try and guide it.

I also just thought, just to give the whole thing even more satire, perhaps the
earth is flat in this world. I actually really like tying this whole thing to
the flat earth theory, because that just shows that this entire thing is a work
that is sort of satire, and sort of not. Indeed, if I take it too seriously,
the whole premise falls flat, and I don't want that. So I like tying this in
with Flat Earth.

That's enough for now, I feel I have discovered a pretty good amount, at least
about the hermit and the nature of his visions, enough to go off of. I still
have the issue of the exact details of the murder that these four find
themselves caught in, but I will get there.

Maybe they are all out hunting together, and they find this hermitage as they
are running from the authorities. As far as why they stop there, and why they
think it is safe to do so (surely the authorities know about he hermitage and
would go there to look, so that doesn't work). Hmm, maybe they escape the
authorities, and they overhear them say that looking any more is futile, and
that they will have to widen the perimeter. Or maybe they are simply out
hunting, but they are hunting in grounds, and they kill the hermit? I don't
like that as much, but it's possible. I will still have to think on it, nothing
I am coming at is really doing it for me.

I have a more concrete view of discovering some of the interactions of the
actual meat of the story anyway, so I will probably discover those before I
discover the actual nature of the murder. So I will begin to write those bits,
and get to the murder in its time.

# 20180711 Dream: Evan takes acid - Musings of my father - Discovery of the Hermit
So today I had a dream that I remember thinking about how much I wanted to talk
about it, and I don't remember some of the details now that I have neglected to
get to it for so long today. And that fault is my own. I will just begin to
talk about it, and see how many details come back to me.

So I know the main bulk of the dream that I remember is at a location, a sort
of park, and at this park (a different park than I have described in the past,
but more like a park that I went to and beheld in colorado, but still different
than that) I was there to join in sort of a "pick-up practice" ultimate game,
an in the previous part of the dream, before this part with the park, I
remember talking with mom, and Evan was there, and there wasn't anything
particularly memorable about this event, except there was a note that I told
myself I would remember about this conversation that I forget now, it had
something to do with something Evan said. Regardless, let me spoil the dream
and say that Evan takes acid between these two events, and I remember the thing
I wanted to note about the before thing was that Evan said something, or was
acting in a certain (rather normal and not at all uncanny) way, and I thought
that it would be the first thing I would forget about this dream. Oh, I
remember now, it has to do with the fact that I took mom on a walk a couple of
days ago, and how I neglected Evan, it had to do with that, and I remember
something of saying like "let's do that". Okay, so I remember, as I park at the
park, I remember Evan coming up to me, and he was very excited. He was telling
me all about this acid trip that he went on, and how it opened up his mind, and
that he knows how to talk more, and that he always knew how to talk, but now he
has realized that he knows how to actually do it more, and he has reason to,
and he is so excited about this whole thing that I couldn't help but feel happy
for him and his new found discovery. I then mentioned something about how I did
mushrooms once, and I asked him to relay what the trip was like on acid because
I had considered doing acid before, but I've never had the means nor the
strong desire to seek those means, so it has never happened to me, but I was
curious what his telling of it was like so that I could compare it to my
mushroom trips. And right as I was asking him about these things, and he was
about to excitedly tell me about all of the trip, mom starts to walk up, and I
hear a voice say something like, "eh,eh,eh" in quick succession like that,
almost like Kyle's voice but Kyle wasn't in the scene, but basically a quick
voice like that that was like "hey, stop what you're talking about because mom
is walking up." So mom starts to walk up, and she trys to make the usual
pleasentries, but what I remember is that she sort of killed the conversation,
and we just went on and I told her about how I was considering joining this
"pick-up ultimate drilling" that was going on, but I was undecided about the
whole thing, and was sort of on the fence, and I remember trying to think of a
way to come up with an excuse for me and Evan to be alone again so he could
tell me about his trip, but it was around that point that I woke up and the
dream ended.

So yeah, that was the dream. Thinking on it, it definitely has to do with the
walk that I had with my mom a couple days ago, and obviously Evan is on my mind
just as far as I do have some concern for his prospects in life, him being a
difficult nut to crack.

Something I do want to ask Evan is, "is anything ever profound to you?" I want
to ask him this because I'm not sure if the answer would be yes or not. The
answer is certainly yes for me, and the answer is in fact that everything is
profound to me, and it's more a matter of degree of profoundity than it is the
actual fact that something is profound. I am just curious what his answer would
be.

Anyway, with that dream out of the way, I do sort of want to go into some
bookkeeping things for my journal. My back is feeling much better after a day
of ice and Ibuprofin, and all that good stuff. I went to morning training with
Paco, and Rose was there as well, so we had a morning training threesome going
on there.

Also, I have spent a lot of my work day planning out how lit.vim plugin, and I
am actually quite happy with what I have done so far. I have essenitially
gotten to the point where I have hacked together some functions that serve to
label the source headers and such, and at this point I need to get to the point
where what is written will get relayed to a reference file that will serve as a
wonderful literary tool for "seeing through" a piece of work. The fact that I
am using vimscript exclusively has me worried that I will write this entire
thing in a contemptuously hacky way, but I am not so overly concerned as I am
getting work done, and doing it in vimscript means that it will be appliciable
pretty directly to the tablet and to my reading material so that I am don't
have to worry about any interop capabilities. The only thing I'm worried about
is getting to a point where I would require the abstraction of a legitimate
programming language, and at that point then I would have to concern myself
with compatibility between the two and so on, so we will see if I decide to go
that route.

Besides that, I do plan to visit my father today. Speaking breifly about him, I
have read a little bit more about Aphasia, the consequences of his stroke, and
it seems that I will have a much better idea about his fate in a month.
However, my strong feeling that I have that I shrug away occasionally, the
feeling I have had that I don't tell anyone about that this is indeed the end,
I think this is the way that feeling is manifesting itself. I can only pray
that he make strong recovery towards being able to at least speak and not soil
himself and move around and eat and all of those things, because if he doesn't
he could be living a pretty miserable life, miserable maybe not for others who
live that life and resign themselves to it, but miserable for him because he
will never resign himself to it I know and I fear that his strength will
overreach his capabilities. I do not fear that he will ever give up, but I fear
that futility will his strongest emotion in this time. I only pray that he
recovers enough to be able to return home with my mother, and that he won't be
resigned to a facility for stroke victims. That would be terrible terrible
suffereing for him, especially depending on the nature of the facility.

I wanted to keep that breif, but just writing that brief paragraph has brought
me to a state of discomfort for him, and I don't know how to transition into
another topic. I could discover more about my story, but I am not feeling so
inspired to do that. I mean, I guess all I would have to do to do that would be
to start talking about the story again, somewhere where I left off, and see
where the conversations go.

In fact, now that I think about it, I had a couple ideas last night that I did
not record, that I now wish I had because they were good. I know it was sparked
by my reading of the Brothers Karamazov, the scene where Mitya is being
questioned about his father. Oh, my idea was this, and it's quite a wretched
idea, and the fact that it comes to me almost disturbes me, and writing about
it is something that I feel would not create any sort of good feeling in me at
all. Indeed, sometimes disconcordant feeling can be interesting, but this
feeling is just strange, as if I know it's a path that doesn't lead to anything
good. It's just sadness and suffering, and there is nothing good that comes out
of it.

I will go ahead and say what this idea was, but I do think I have already
decided that I am not going to write a story such as this, so I'm not sure if
there is really a point to it. The idea is... I can't. Shit. Okay, so I feel as
though I haven't prefaced this enough, or perhaps I have prefaced it too much.
Basically, the idea is of a son that kills his father in a vegatable state, out
of suppossed and misguided mercy for him. However, I dislike this idea for a
multitude of reasons. Besides the obvious that it would re-enforce a mind
pathway that I don't want to re-enforce in myself, besides that simple fact
that it would be unhealthy for me to write a story like that (and also it would
give concern to anyone who read it, as it is so strikingly close to my current
situtation, and they might think that I was legimately stuggling with that idea
when I am not), but also because I don't think it would make a very interesting
story. Indeed, I have not read yet Crime and Punishment, but I know that this
idea of killing someone for not the typical reasons of murder but for a
supposed saintly reason has been explored greatly and with much more well
spoken literary prowess (I can only assume) than I could give. That, and I just
don't see how this story would go to make any interesting or remarkable points,
especially if I told it in that way. It seems more like the topic of a CSI
syndicate than it is an actual well thought out novel or story, so I will pass
on saying any more about this silly idea.

So I will instead diverge to more discovery of my "The Hermit" story (and I
like that title for the story, although I am certainly not so fond of it to say
that it is for sure the final title of the story) by starting with a brief
description of how I know the outline should go.

So the story should start with the description of the hermit, and his life in
his hermitage. I don't want to give any more background on him or his
motivations for becoming a hermit, but I do want to talk about some of his
habits, how he cultivates his garden, his fasting rituals, and the like, to
give a sort of scene of how this man lives his life. I then want to, after
talking about this entire thing (or perhaps before, that could be the hook to
this section) tell of how his hermaitage had been raided by some animal, and
all of the food he had gathered to break his fast was utterly gone, even his
emergency supplies, and so he knew that unless he were to do something about
it, he would undoubtedly starve. So I want then this hermit to go out into the
woods to gather some berries, but as he does, something happens to him. I have
not decided yet whether or not he is attacked by some animal. Maybe he has a
heart attack. I actually like that, and even though I have no longer had a
heart attack, him having a heart attack in the forest there is a good closing
to that section. I like the heart attack over animal attack, as the heart
attack is more likely a course of how events might play. And as he has the
heart attack, he has the thought that "this is how I die, this is the end for
me" and he comes to peace with that and closes his eyes and everything turns
black.

At this point is where the initial hook should end. From there, I then want to
jump to the scene which will lead to the murder of my four characters. I want
them to be all together, perhaps on the way to something or some activity, but
when they do they run across someone, someone who is perhaps a friend, or at
least not someone who is an acquaintence, and they meet him to gather supplies.
Indeed, maybe they are out in the wilderness, all four of them, and they go to
a humble shop that they know to be there. And they are hunting, that is what
they are doing. And so the dogmatic athiest has his gun (they all have their
guns) as they go into this remote shop (or maybe it is a house in a remote
village). Actually, I really like the idea of a remote village in Alaska. I
like that because it's believable as far as I know that there are a lot of
villages and things there, and it could be a good spot for a hermitage. I like
it too because it's forseeable that there could be some sort of getaway there.
So I think the way I want this to happen, (and I am surprised I am discovering
this at this moment, but so be it) is for the group to get in an argument with
this guy. Maybe they want certain supplies, or something, and they are asking
this man for some, but he won't give them. So the dogmatic athiest pulls his
gun on the guy, and threatens him and when the guy stares down his gun and
says, "What are you doing, do you really plan to shoot me" the guy does, and
his gun fires. Then, in teh commotion that follows, it will be revealed later
that he didn't realize the gun was loaded, and that it was an honest mistake. I
could then go on to talk about the concept of how an honest mistake could have
different consequences.

I'm not entirely satisfied with this sequence of events. Another way this could
play out is, as they are having dinner with this guy, (and a difficulty that I
just thought would be the fact that people would probably know that this group
of four was coming to visit. This could be solved by having the guy that is
killed be a recent inductee to Alaska, and that he is not well connected yet,
and his friends are coming to visit him in a sort of homecoming) as they are
having dinner, the dogmatic athiest gets caught up in a story, and as he gets
caught up in his story, he gets out of his seat, and to demonstrate something,
maybe to demonstrate the prowess of his skeet shooting abilities, or perhaps in
dramatic effect, or, and I like this now that I think about it, he is talking
about this time he looked down the barrel of a gun. And as he does so, he asks
the guy "have you ever looked down the barrel of a gun?" and he pulls out his
rifle and points it at him in a sudden movement. And I want to describe the guy
become very uncomfortable, and recoil, and say something like, "No, I haven't
until this point, and I can quite say you have made your point. You are making
me very uncomfortable right now, and I would appreciate if you would
withdraw..." and at that word withdraw the gun should fire. I would then
describe the hole in his head, perhaps in some way to indicate a sort of
symbolism, an empty hole in his forehead as if it were the socket of his third
eye, or something like that, and without a doubt the man was dead. The
description of his dead body, and of the scene that happens soon after, I'm not
sure, but in this way, the killer, the dogmatic athiest, begins to reel back,
and say something like "well that was quite impossible, quite impossible
indeed, the gun was not loaded and I had the safety on, and my finger was not
even on the trigger." and he examines the gun to find that the safety was
indeed on and he shows it to the cynical agnostic, who replies with something
like "well, regardless of how impossible it was, it's certainly difficult to
argue with the dead man here". Indeed, this entire scene will be difficult to
write, and it will be easier once I have discovered better my characters.
However, I do believe I have discovered the event which led to this, and more
or less the situation in how it plays out.

So after they gather themselves and have a discussion about what to do, the
four of them elect to take the man out, and bury him deep in the wilderness,
far away from the house they were in at that time. And as they go out to bury
him, I could examine some of their thoughts maybe. I could say how on their
trek, maybe one of them says, "Is this far enough" and someone starts to lose
his shit on the killer, and they all go through this struggle, until they
eventually decide that they have found their spot, somewhere in the woods, and
after they bury him, and they try and retrace their steps back to the town,
they get into an argument about a few things. First would be an argument about
whether or not they should even go back to the village, and I just thought of a
comment, something like "well if we don't go back we might as well dig four
more holes for all of us to lie in" or something like that. At some point also,
I want them to talk about their situation, and second guess their decision to
bury the guy and feign innocence, and for the agnostic to say something like
"indeed, I'm sure if we explained everything exactly how it happened, we could
be pardoned on counts of manslaughter" but then the killer would say something
like "and what's to say a story doesn't come out that we were all in it
together"

I have to give pause here, I'm not entirely liking where this is going. I like
the concept of "divine intervention caused the bullet to be fired" but I don't
like that one of them is entirely more guilty than the other three. I need them
to be all guilty of the crime in at least a comparable way, beyond being just
witnesses. I'm not sure how much I really do like this version of the crime.

I will have to figure it out. Maybe the crime is not murder, but maybe they
were up to something anyway, maybe they were all a part of some different crime
all together, that resulted in one of them pointing his gun to threaten
someone, and then the gun fired, and then they have to deal with that all
together. I like that better, in as far as it makes them all guilty, and it
allows me to write the line "And once they had degraded themselves to burglary,
why not also hide the murder" or something worded better than that, to describe
how they resolve to be in agreement about what to do from there.

What I don't like about all of these is that it limits what sorts of characters
I can write. In this version, all of the characters have to be criminals, and
that goes against having a goody two shoes Christian character. Perhaps there
are three of them tied to the burglary, and they call up their good two shoes
friend, who gets dragged into the whole thing. I like that. The athiest is
certainly the one who's gun fires, and I think the agnostic I am cool with
being there, although that would require him to have a nihilistic attitude.
Indeed, he could be a nihilist, although not a hedonist. Indeed, his
nervousness at the whole situation could be a catalyst for discussion. The
getaway driver could be the converted Christain, and that converted Christian
could be the one to call the goody two shoes.

The thing I dislike about all of these things is that it creates so much
tension, and I feel as though the tension created will overwhelm the
disscussions of the actual works of the hermit, which is what I want the focal
point to be. So perhaps the murder is not something that I want, maybe that is
too much. I'm not sure. I'll have to think on it. I might have to discover more
about these characters before I come up with more plot points.

# 20180712 Time Management - Visit of my father, who talks of Bowties
Okay, so I think I have decided on a system that will optimize my time spent
doing these things while at the same time ensuring that I get work done. That
system will be to have certain set times where I only allow myself to do things
related to work, and certain set times where I only allow myself to do things
such as this. When I break it down, what makes the most sense to me is
something like this.

1 hour for writing
1 hour for Russian
1 hour for Reading
1 hour for other things (I could back up this hour with my writitng time as
that is the one that will most often spill. Either that, or make the writing
time not a strict hour, and have the other ones, like reading and other, be
more strict.)
4 hours for work.

The reason I feel the need for this sort of system is because, while I do still
feel guilty about doing this at all during work hours, yesterday I ran in to a
sort of conundrum that gave me pause for this whole thing. Yesterday, I spent a
lot of time working on my vimscript to mark the headers for my lit md files,
and I was making some good progress on it, and as I was working on it, it got
to be 3:30 and I still hadn't really done any actual work. And a thought came
into my head that was the most strange of thoughts. I remember thinking, "so I
should work more on this now, because if I don't then I will want to work more
on it tomorrow, but tomorrow I want to be doing actual work, so I should work
more on this now so that I have more time tomorrow to do my actual work."

Now, obviously, this I feel has only one valid psychological interpretation,
and that is that I simply wanted to come up with any excuse to keep working on
this thing and not do my actual work, which is concerning to me, as at that
moment, it actually felt wrong to me, intuitively speaking, to do any actual
work. Then I had the thought like "how come I feel like doing my work while I'm
at work and working on Alliant's time is the wrong course of action? Surely
that's wrong."

At the time yesterday, I didn't think much about it beyond that, but for some
reason today I came upon this thought, and immediately came up with this sort
of scheme.

I think it will be best to plan out the exact hours and minutes I have allotted
to do these things, at least at first, so that I can better keep myself hoest
with my actual work time. You see, and I don't know if this is a case of
mistaken priorities or if this is a legitimate way of thinking, but to me
thinks like this journalling and learning Russian, and reading, and the other
things, those things are more important to me than my work at Alliant. Now, you
could argue that I could try and find a way to make my work at Alliant more
fulfilling and fun, and in doing that I could make it one of those things that
I create priority for, but I think that that is not the case, that my work at
Alliant will be where it stands, and I honestly really like this job for the
freedom it gives me to pursue other passions during my work hours, dishonest
though it may be.

So enough on that. I have spent my first twenty minutes of my writing time now
(well, I didn't start right at eight o'clock, but whatever) talking about how I
want to organize my writing time, so let's move on to a different subject now.

So I know last night as I was reading as I do, I ran across a passage in the
Brother's Karamazov that sparked an idea for me, and I remember how I would
forget the idea if I didn't get my phone and speak it out loud, and indeed that
is the case now, and I don't remember the idea. I am just finishing up the
whole section about Mitya's money, and how he claims to have only spent 1500 of
Katya's sum at first and then the 1500 later, but that it goes against all of
the other evidence pointed towards him, and something in these passages sparked
the idea, but even still I don't think it was one of those ideas that was
direcetly related to the story I was reading, so I think it might be gone
forever.

A similar thing is true of the sparse dreams I had last night. I know I had
some sort of dreams last night, but I can't remember anything about them. I do
remember telling myself what it is I should remember about the dreams in order
to have something to write down here, but I took another ten minute nap after
that and proceeded to entirely forget even that, so suffice it to say, I had a
pretty strong sense of "well, I might as well remember a bit of this dream but
even that isn't important" and it must not have been important to my dream,
because I don't remember a bit of it at all.

So enough on that to. How about I talk about things that I actually remember
now.

I visited my father yesterday evening, and I was actually quite comforted by
how well he is doing. I have great confidence that he will have a strong
recovery from this stroke, but I only pray for his soul to be eased. He is
extremely hard on himself, and that frustration is very visible, not only in
his frustration not to conjure up the words for what he wants to say, but also
frustration in the fact that he feels "beaten" in a since, and maybe a little
degraded, and that he isn't able to see his own progress in a way.

However, his progress is very noticably there. Today, as we were watching the
TV, on the TV was a guy named Chuck Yaeger, someone who I have never heard of
before, but who my dad was able to remember from a movie that I forget the name
of now, and it was a movie all about the space race and the pilots around
during that time, and apparently this guy was the first to break the sound
barrier in any moving vehicle. So the memory recall is getting very strong, but
he was so upset at himself because he thought that Clint Eastwood was in that
movie, but he wasn't, but he recognized a lot of other characters from the
movie, and could identify the actors. He asked also to see faces, and upon
seeing the faces gained instant recognition of the people, and was able to
remember the names. So yeah, I think my mom is just trying to scare me by
talking about how poorly he is doing, I swear she has a way of phrasing things
to concern me. But that is a whole nother topic. Basically, I say all of this
just to say that I have pretty full confidence that the path my father is on
will be one that leads to a very strong recovery.

The other thing, and perhaps the more relevent to what I would want to write
about here (actually, the first thing is more in the spirit of what I want to
write here, but this one is too. How about we not get distracted on relevence),
is that my father wanted to tell me about something when I first arrived. When
I first got at the hospital, it was Linda and my dad, and I timed the visit
just wrong, during a shift change, when nurses were changing things about my
dad, and re-orging everything, and they pulled back the curtain, and the first
bit I just spoke with Linda for a bit, and I got the sort of updates from her.

So after that, after the nurses had finished their rounds and it was just the
three of us in the room, Linda went out to get some food while I kept my father
company, and the first thing he wanted to talk to me was this. He started to
try and talk to me, and he struggled on the words pastor at first, but I
gathered that there was a pastor that was visiting, and then he struggled on
the word bowtie, and the imagary of the bowtie was most prominent for him, but
he stuggled on that word quite a bit multiple times in the entire conversation,
but he would always refer to the bowtie when he talked about this. And after we
got past those difficulties, he mentioned that mom had said that I was
struggling with my faith, and with god, and I gave pause to that, and he
noticed that pause (indeed, my father seems to do very well with conversation,
but still not to the point where I could feel comfortable making any sort of
statements that would make him uneasy about his or my position in faith) and I
said that I wasn't struggling, but instead that I just saw the sort of strength
that he gets in his faith, and I see that in him, and that there is something
that we all share, all of us, that we don't know how to describe, and there is
some truth in that that is undeniable. In fact, I am getting this conversation
a bit out of order, because before some of that he mentioned that he had prayed
with the pastor for me, and he pretty much asked me point blank, pretty early
on in that discussion, if I believed. And I replied something like, "Well,
belief is a very broad word that could mean lots of things, and I wouldn't say
I entirely believe in the sense that you would be meaning it right here and
now, but I do see his faith, the faith that you have that gives you your
strength, and that strength is undeniable, and I've always known it to be
there, but to witness it, that it seeing that faith in him has a profound
effect on me, and that it is undeniable that there must be some sort of truth
in that, a truth that is in him, and in me, and a truth that we all share but
none of us can describe, and I certainly believe in that, but" and at this
point I wavered a bit going on about how I wish I could articulate better but
that these things really don't have words, and how many men have tried to
describe but we all fall short of it, and at this my father said "Yes, I fall
short," and I said, "Yes, and I fall short as well, we all fall short" and I
liked that instant reaction by me to place that burden of falling short on all
of us, because I know he feels solely responsible for falling short, but in
that moment I feel I conveyed rather genuinely that not all of the blame should
go to him, and that I shared some of that "falling shortness" and that we all
shared that "falling shortness". Regardless, this entire portrayal of this
conversation is entirely much to disjointed, and I feel as though I have not
done it properly, so I will attempt to put all of the things in the right
order.

So my father mentions the bowtie, and he mentions how he prayed with mom and
the pastor for me. He then asks me if I believe, and I give my answer that I
believe in a certian sense, and that that undeniable truth that I see in him,
"I certainly believe in that" and he said that he liked that. I then went on to
try and continue to articulate, but not knowing how far I could take this and
still be understood, I just mentioned that I was falling short of explaining
myself, and then we had that interaction about falling short.

That is how the conversation went. Holy shit, why was that so difficult to put
in order? I don't think that has anything to do with the fact that it was a
difficult conversation to have, indeed, I am recalling it now with a sort of
indifferent factual interest in mind, but I guess it is because it was a rather
fast and furious conversation. Towards the end of it, I also said something
like "I don't know if that gives you any more or less comfort, but that's where
I stand" or something like that, and he replied with "it does and it doesn't"
so that is that and everything is out there now.

So yeah, the rest of the visit went how you might imagine the visit might go, I
stayed there for a couple of hours before leaving. At the end, he became very
confused. At the time I was not understanding why he was confused, but I think
that he thought that I had to get to yoga (because a lot of other visits I have
made before I have to go to yoga) and when I told him that I wasn't doing yoga
that evening (he asked earlier about BJJ and Yoga and all the things I was
doing) I mentioned that I had gone every day for a month, but that I haven't
gone recently. So as I was leaving, he mentioned that he was very confused, and
I said I wish I knew what I wasn't being entirely clear about, and that I wish
I knew what about what I was saying was making him confused, and he said, I do
to, and I said I'm sure with my laugh, and he mentioned that he like that
laugh. Earlier in the conversation he mentioned the laugh as well, as I feel my
laugh comes out genuinely in these conversations, and I said, "well, I
inherited it from someone", and well, that was all there was to that part, but
he mentioned it a few times during the conversation and then at the end of the
conversation as I was leaving. So yeah.

This time there was no crying or coming on to the verge of tears, instead it
was simply an idle reflection on the visit as I went home. I look forward to
seeing Jason and meeting my father with Jason in the hospital in the next
couple of days, and I am sure I will have a lot to write about that when that
time comes as well.

So yeah, at this point it is my stopping point for my writting for the day, but
I feel like I want to discover more about my short stories, but at the same
time I feel obligated to stick to the schedule of "actually doing work", but at
the same time it's thirty minutes before my chiro appointment, so I'm in this
back and forth. The thing is, I don't have much that I want to discover, I'm
not feeling particularly inspired to discover anything, but I do want to
discover something, because my discovery yesterday felt like it was left sort
of hanging, and I don't like that, and I want to leave it not hanging. But I
think I will be a good person, and get to work, to at least start to get back
to the whole thing again, so I will end this entry here.

# 20180713 Diet - Visions then Dreams: Walking with Janet, BJJ in Garage, Takashi and a video game, Diarehha in the tub
So yesterday night I had a lot of dreams. Like, a lot of dreams, and they were
all I think somewhat connected but mostly not. I want to at first just get the
dreams out on paper before I actually go into any details, just so I'm able to
put it together a bit better in my head.

So the first dream had to do with my dream version of Duck Creek. That version
of Duck Creek is actually very similar to the version of irl, but I am getting
into details now and I don't want to do that yet. The next part of the dream
was in the garage of my parents house, which has had been a location of my
dreams in the past, but it had to do with BJJ. The next part of the dream I was
definitely playing a game, and this game had six bosses, each with two forms,
and I fought the two forms of the first boss, before I interacted with Takashi
a bit. And the last part of the dream had to do with me inputing a code into
the sink of some dream person's apartment, and that turned the sink into
diahhrea. So yeah. A lot of stuff going on this night.

I do feel like it is important to note, that since the Chiropracter has told me
about ginger and turmeric, yesterday after work I went to whole foods and got
a bunch of those roots, and then I went to Target and got myself a blender, and
I started experimenting with different sorts of Kale and spinich shakes. The
first one I took a bunch of Kale and Spinich and Ginger and Garlic and Turmeric
and put a bunch of that shit all together in the blender and tried to blend it
up, but it wasn't blending at all, like, not at all, and at first I thought it
was just because it was a piece of shit blender (and it was pretty cheap
compared to the other blenders on the shelf) but more it had to do with the
fact that I just put whole chunks of shit in there. So I opened it up, and
started taking the stuff out, and then fed it in one pice at a time after
choping it up (and mind you, this shit was wet and gross because I had a bit of
water in there as well) and when I did all of that (and I think my hand are
premanently green now, as they are green this next morning even after washing
them at least a half a dozen times with soap since then) it blended up pretty
good. But then when I went to try and drink it, it was really potent, to the
point where I couldn't take more than a sip without my sinuses flaring up
something fierce, and at first I thought this might be the garlic. So I washed
everything up, and I chopped up more managable portions of everything, minus
the garlic, and I used orange juice this time, and I fed everything into the
blender, and went for round two, this time using a good amount of ice as well.
And this time it came up much more like a slushie to my surprise, and I was
honestly quite astonished at how well the thing crushed up the ice into a sort
of almost solid form, but this time I could not chug at all, there was simply
no way, as the form of the thing was like a slushie, like I said, and so I
poured that one out and decided to go for one last shot. Oh, and also, the
drink was still really potent, like, horse radishy kind of potent, and I still
didn't know what that was. So I tasted some of the ginger root, and I promptly
realized that that was the potency that I had tasted in both drinks before, and
so I decided to forgoe the ginger root and the garlic for this last drink, and
just use orange juice, kale, spinich, turmiric root, and ice. And so I did all
of that, this time in more reasonable porportions, and this time the drink came
out drinkable, (although still a little too slushie like for what I want) and
actually did not taste horrible. So after I finished drinking it, I proceeded
to cook the salmon (over a pound of it in one filet) and sweet potatoes (which
I am honestly not too excited about) and I ate that for my dinner.

So after I finished everything (I didn't finish the sweet potatoes, I decided
to put butter in them and I think that was a mistake, but I think I am not too
interested in sweet potatoes anyway), I cleaned up the horrible mess I made as
best I could, and I then proceeded to lay down to read. Now, I probably did a
few other things before I did all of this, but pretty soon after I finish
eating and cleaning, I lay down to sleep, and began to read. And as I began to
read, I started to notice I was a little quesy (although not overly so) but
more I felt like I was almost starting to get a sort of out of body experience,
not in a "a feel high" sort of way, but I started to dissassociate the words
from my experience, and reading became difficult, although in a different way
than the way I talked about after I eat PBJ, but still I felt as though I was
maybe just a little uneasy would be the best way to put it. Although this
uneasiness extended beyond just the simple stomach sort of uneasiness. I felt
as though I were done reading, and instead I just wanted to contemplate things.

So I put the tablet down, and turned to my side and wrapped the blanket over
me, and as I did this, my imagination started to run wild. I began getting
ideas, musical ideas, that just appeared to me, and I tried to figure out from
what piece or work these musical ideas were coming from, and I couldn't figure
it out. You see, usually when I have musical ideas, they tend to come from
other sonatas or symphonies or other such works that I have listened to, and
that's where the ideas come from, but I morph them slightly in my head, and I
tell myself that this is my own original musical idea. Either that, or what I
am able to come up with is mostly random as far as melody goes, and creates no
movement or emotion but simply exists as a simple string of notes. Well, I will
say that these musical ideas, they came to me in random bursts, and I would try
and focus on one and repeat it and try and attach it to something I had heard
before, but I couldn't, so I feel I was actually getting these ideas, ideas of
decent sounding music, entirely on my own. But like I said, each of these ideas
came in sorts of bursts, and I am not talented enough with improv or ear
training to be able to write down what the ideas were or know how I would
recreate them.

Also, in addition to this, I had visions of my brain. Now, whether these were
actual visions of the brain, or images of what I think my brain is like, I
don't know. But as I was thinking about how my analytical musical abilities are
so well developed, but my artistic ear and improv and creative abilites are
not, I saw a whole network of neurons on one side (and it happened to be the
left, which is why I suppose this is the "vision of the vision" of my brain)
and on the other side, the right side, I saw a few barely firing neurons that
were being overwhelmed by the left. And as I saw all of this, I immedietly and
consciously interpreted it as my musical capabilities, and I thought, "I wonder
how I could develop the right side" and I knew that the best way would be to
get a teacher. And at about that point, I started to ponder just exactly what
effect this kale spinich turmeric shake was having on me, and I considered what
sort of wild dreams I might have, and I fell into sleep.

Well, as I already said, the first part of the dream was walking through my
dream version of Duck Creek. Now, this version of Duck Creek, is very similar
to the real version, except the creek and the banks are exageratted, and the
entire thing is just a little bit more grand. Well, as I was beginning my walk,
I was walking with my mom and Janet Bresson, and eventully we got to a turning
point, and my mom went left to our house (like we do some times) and Janet and
I decided to keep walking along the rest of the path, and at that point I was
able to talk with her. Now the interpretation of this part of the dream is
pretty straight forward, as I was thinking about Janet this entire time I was
making the shake, and thinking about how much I wanted to pick her brain about
how to make it and what to put in it, and etc etc. so I think that there is not
much to contemplate there.

The next part of the dream has me returning to my parents home (and I think
this part of the dream was disconnect from duck creek, in fact I know it is)
and while I was there I entered my parents garage. I don't remember from which
side I entered, but I think it was the inside entrance, and when I got in
there, I was surprised to see a bunch of people rolling. Chris was there, and a
few other BJJ faces, although not many that I recognize, and I think a few were
just dream faces that were my BJJ people dream faces, but what surprised me is
that I know Kyle was there as well as I beleive my mom, and they were rolling
together, although I know Kyle was rolling there and I'm not sure about my mom.
Anyway, Troy I know was also there, and he mentioned he was going to put on a
round timer, and all of this is very much because today is a Friday, so I think
I was anticipating the open mat that was to arrive today. However, the fact
that it was in my parents garage left me a bit befuddled.

So next up, we have the video game dream. Now, I forget which part of the dream
happened first, and which was next. In fact, I think I remember, and if this
wasn't the order than fuck it it is now. So the dream started with me in a sort
of multi bedroom apartment. Now that I think about the layout, I'm thinking
back to the apartment the Stevesy, Turkey, and Waildog had together, but the
only thing I know about this dream apartment is that it had an upstairs area
with a sort of communal area, which is where I was playing the game that I will
describe later, but there was a sort of hallway, at the end of which led down
some stairs (a lot similar to Jaq's apartment at A&M now that I think about it)
but I didn't ever venture down the stairs (and indeed I don't even know what is
down there) but I remember going and peeking into one of the rooms, and in that
room was Takashi in a full suit, like business suit, but the kind of suit a
celebrity would wear to an event if that celeb was trying to make a statement,
because it was a sort of bright navy blue (it was navy blue, but very saturated
navy would be the better way to describe the color) and the while shirt he had
under it was striped from top to bottom very noticably with thin red stripes,
and he also had I tie but I can't recall what sort of tie it was. Also, the
shoes were you typical very fancy very expensive dress shoes, the kind of shoes
that say "I want to stand out in a dignified way" or something like that.
Anyway, I look into this room, and I am brought immediatly by two emotions at
once. The first emotion was a sort of recognition of a friend that I have not
seen for a long time, and a want to embrace him, and the second was a very
strange feeling that I don't know how to deal with. It was a feeling of "What
would they think if they knew I was fraternizing with a gay man" which, I have
had my suspicions, but I know Taka isn't gay, at least I am pretty sure of that
fact, and he has actually mentioned to me before that one of his friend
girl/girl friend weird relationship things, her father thought he was gay due
to the way he interacted with the girl, but regardless, the fact that that is
the thought I had, not only that he was gay but also the repulsion of my
thought what others would think of me if they knew I was hanging out with a gay
man, I'm not sure if that's some lingering homophobia that I wish I didn't have
inside of me or if it's something else. I don't think it's homophobia, but
instead the notion of insecurity in not my sexuality but in what other people
might think of who I am and what I stand for. Now that I think about it, I hate
being put into boxes and being labeled, and I think that, while labeling is
something that has to be done and is something that is a good way to let people
know where you stand on a certain subject in a very brief and informative way,
I hate when those labels are looked at as anything more than labels, and I
think that may be where my "drawn back" feeling comes from in regards to this
portion of the dream.

Anyway, after I drew back from him, he walked out of his room, and I was back
in the living room, and he asked me if everything was okay, and that we haven't
seen eachother in a long time, and I immediately sort of halted my withdrawal.
I don't remember if we shared a hug, although thinking about it I think we did,
although it was not a very memorable or important aspect of the dream. So we
hugged, and then I mentioned that I wanted to play this new game.

So I start this game, and this game became the dream, as video games do in
dreams, and there is not much I want to say about this dream except this. One,
the game was pretty rudimentary as far as texturing and open world design goes.
It started in one of the edges of a box, and the structure of it was as a sort
of big box that had a bunch of littler boxes representing buildings in the
dream, and the first street that you can get to has the first boss on it. Well,
I remember flying around a bit and I had a sword, and I used the sword to beat
the boss, which was nothing more than a large robot thing, also very
unimaginative, but when I did to my surprise, the boss respawned, and when it
did, the sword I was holding turned many colors, and the boss came back also
with his joints being his weak points also being multiple colors, and I
determined that I would have to use the different parts of the sword, which was
a very large and thin sword, so each of these colored sections had quite a
large window of forgivness, to hit the colored sections of the robot, and the
colors had to match when they did. Takashi was sort of just there when all of
this was going on, and he began explaining the whole thing to me, but I told
him that I had it figured out, and that I knew what to do. Well, I proceeded to
beat this second form of the boss just as easily as the first form, but this
time with the added gimmick of the colors and the swords, and after I did,
Takashi then explained to me the nature of the rest of the game, how there were
six bosses total, each with two forms, and they all got harder and harder and
the first boss was more of a tutorial than anything. I said that I got the
idea, and I stopped playing the game.

This is when the next portion of the dream started, and I don't remember if
Takashi left and someone else came in, or if the person who was Takashi just
changed like people do in dreams into this non-descript dream face person, but
in this next part of the dream, I went to the restroom, and when I did, I had
heard about this thing you could input into the sink to make it procure poopy
sewage water instead of regular water, and I had done it before and entered it
again and when I did this before I remembered it going back to regualar water,
and there was no harm. Well, I wanted to try it again, just to see, and I
entered in "National Lampoon" into the keyboard there at the sink, and it did
indeed turn the water from water to poopy diahhrea water. So when it started
doing this, I had that moment like "well of course it does still work" and so I
tried to enter it in to reverse what was going on, but it didn't work, and I
spent a good amount of time trying to reverse the procees. I remember looking
at the toilet, because I remember thinking if I could turn off water to the
toilet it would turn off the water entierly and that would fix the problem, but
when I looked at the source of water there was no valve and instead it was
being controlled by this module that the only input to was this keyboard, so I
determined that there was no physical way to make it stop that made since, so I
needed to figure it out in a different way. At this point I remember becoming
rather embarrased at what I had done, and frantically began trying to think of
ways to cover it up, so I removed the head of the sink, which was detachable
for whatever reason, and I directed the spray of the poopy water into the bath
tub, and the tub started to fill with this sewage diarehha water, and I had
determined that at least that had bought me more time (as though draining poopy
water into the tub was better than draining it into the sink) and I tried to
think of a way make it stop. I evaluated all of my options, but all of them
seemed silly, and the notion of telling the person who wasn't Takashi anymore
but was the person living in that apartemnt was still too embarrassing, but I
was also coming to the acceptance of the fact that hiding this sort of thing
would not work either, so I was still deliberating all of my options. As I was
doing this, I think I walked out, and I was sort of determined to swallow my
pride and embarassment and tell him about the situation, and as I walk out, it
was actually he who made the first intearcation. He took his penis out and
began peeing on the little chiuajua dog that he had, a furry little shit of a
dog, and he did so with glee in his face, and as he was doing it he said to me
"Check this out, I can piss on him and clean him at the same time. I needed to
pee and he needed to be cleaned, so it's two birds with one stone", which is
obviously completly absurd, but him doing that gave me comfort that he would
not give any care towards the situation I had created in his restroom. Well,
before I could get anything out, and after he finished peeing on his dog and
telling me about it, he immediately looked into the restroom and saw the
sinking still spewing diarehha water into the tub, and he saw that and he
said, "Bro, I'm sorry man, that sink does that sometimes and I don't know how
to fix it, I'm really sorry about that," and at that point, I had resolved to
tell him about the whole situation, and how I was the one who entered in the
"National Lampoon" into the keyboard which caused the sink to do that, but at
his apology, I considered telling him anyway, but instead of doing that it was
easier (and fewer words to say, and flowed better with the conversation) to
just say, "Nah, it's all good, I wasn't sure what to do about it so I had it
flow into the bathroom" and at that he said "yeah, I'm really sorry again,
don't worry about cleaning it or anything, I'll take care of it" and I have no
clue how he planned to take care of it, but he had put the burden on himself,
and I remember thinking about how I didn't tell him about my role in the whole
thing causing this situation right now, and I even remeber thinking about how I
could reveal to him why it happens, and how that could be benefit to him, but I
didn't do those things, and instead just let him take care of it. Around that
point is when I woke up.

Now, the concept of Diarehha flowing everywhere makes sense to me as a sort of
fear I have of this Kale shake that I just made, as I did make a comment to
myself after I drank it about "I wonder what my shit is going to be like
tomorrow" but there is clearly a lot more at play here than that. In fact, I
may have met another character now that I think about, although I don't know
his name. The other two, the adjudicator and the tyrant, both had very obvious
names to me, but this one does not. The Bro, is the first name that comes to
mind, but that seems a little to generic to be a character in my mythology. I
guess, when I say this one doesn't have an immediate name that comes to mind,
that's a lie, because the bro is the name that comes to mind, I just don't like
it. So yeah, I guess I have met "The Bro".

So I have spent the better part of the past eighty minutes writing about this
now, and feel like I still want to keep writing, although again I don't have
anything in particular I want to write about. The two most memorable features
of this dream are my intearctions with Takashi and my interactions with the
sink in the restroom. Both of them don't really represent anything profound,
but they are interesting little pieces none the less.

I know yesterday, Linda went home and Jason should have arrived, so I will plan
to visit tonight. I was considering Bikram, but after taking over a week off of
that, I don't know how much I will want to go there any more, as the rigidity
is quite silly in my opinion. On the one hand, I like the really rigid
structure of it, but the concept of flow is just as important to me, more so
actually, and I really hate how the nature of Bikram is to force you into a
very specific posture in a specific order the same time every time in the same
way. It's good for me to do that just because I don't like it, because doing
things you don't like is good sometimes, but at the same time it's silly and
dumb, because I know I get more benefit when I actually go in and do the
postures that I feel as though I need, and I flow from one to the next in the
ways that make sense for my body at that moment, I feel that I can get more
benefit from doing that than by imposing an artificial (and in my opinion some
times questionable) structure on the whole thing. So I will certainly pass on
that today, but I might go over the weekend or next week if I am feeling so
inspired.

# 20180714 Dream of a real life video game, of a childly recital theater - Discovery Writing Damien
So last night I had a dream, a dream that had some interesting points but as a
whole was mostly absurd. Granted, most of my dreams are absurd. This one is one
that takes place in that same world as dream Seattle, and the dream version of
the place where I met my dad and Chuck fishing, although definitely in a
different part of it. I know I had to go through the dream version of highway
635 to get to this place, and the end of the dream has my dream version of what
would analgolously be the whole mess of interchange that is 114 and 121 and 183
and all of those sorts of roads there (although in the dream version there is
no airport, it's just a lot of roads that have really elaborate interchanges.
Anyway, I guess, to get to the bulk of the dream, (and I honestly really like
this dream more because it reminds me of the map, which I might draw later, of
a sort of fictional city, my dream city, that I know what it looks like) this
dream mostly revolves around me, Nick Lacosi, and Kyle, all playing this sort
of weird 3v3v3 game that has video game like qualities, but is played in the
real world (the real world of the dream). It had to do with this area of the
world, which in this dream world there are people, but the concept of "living
somewhere" isn't one that we find burdensome I guess, but there is a whole open
space which we basically use to play this game. We then choose our characters,
similar to a blind pick draft in LOL, and we spend turns fortifying and
otherwise arranging ourselves on this area. Well, in this first phase of the
game, when it is our turn, we all know that we are not taking this game as
seriously, as in, we are taking it seriously, but this game is not a serious
part of our lives, and we have not dedicated ourselves to this game in the same
way the other two teams had, and so after our first phase, we know that we are
not going to win, and that we should probably just withdraw, not out of safety
or honor or anything, but because we all know that the other team will easily
win and that there isn't much point in continuing. Now, I don't want to dwell
on the rules of this game, because, quite honestly, I don't really understand
them myself, and clearly the rules of it were not important to my dream self
understanding what was going on, so they are not important to try and write
down, at least, I don't feel that they are, so I don't really feel like making
much sense out of it. The only other thing I remember is that Evan was there
and he showed us, "hey, check out this character, he's so broken" and he
actually was the character, which was most similar to Vladimir from LOL, and he
showed us how he could dash, and attack, and use his three moves with very
little cooldown almost indefinitely, and he was dashing around basically saying
how fun it was, and how broken it was, and how is this balanced, and things
like that, and I remember thinking something like, "well, he is very weak when
he is not leveled and you haven't gotten to that strength yet" because he had
leveled up the character to max, and was abusing the powers of the character to
its fullest.

So after we had more or less decided to resign, I decide to make my way through
this area. Like I said, I had driven through the 635 dream version to get here,
and by the way 635 actually does go north south like I imagine everything
around my parents place to be, and so after arriving at this place from the
south, and exploring it a bit with Nick and Kyle, I get back in my car and go
through it further north, and I was on some objective for them (we hadn't
entirely given up, but we had resigned ourselves to our fate) but I remember
when I drove north I got to a sort of intersection that went down and curved
way up and to the left, and around that point I got lost, because I knew I was
not going to reach the destination this way, or something like that, and I
called Kyle and Nick, and they gave me shit for not even being able to drive to
where I wanted (I think they were waiting for me for something, I forget what)
and I returned their shit, but I knew that my shit didn't have the sort of ammo
that theirs did, as I was basically giving them shit for giving me shit, and
around then was the end of that dream.

I also remember another area, and this area is interesting because I remember
having dream Gym meets that were done here (long long after I should even be
dreaming about Gym meets), but this time it was repurposed in to what was I
think a sort of soliloquy show for children Kinley's age. Kinley was in this
performance, and the stir and bustle of everyone in the area was like that of
that dance recital of Kinley's that I went to that one time, with mom and dad
and Kyle and Evan and everyone there, but I don't remember much of any details
besides the dream. I do remember two details. One was the location. This entire
thing was shaped like a box, and towards the stage area was the lowest area,
then it came up along like the stands to the area, and at the top of that area
was there was a walking area, so not at all unlike what you would imagine that
should be like. The only really peculiar thing was that the stage area was
divided into two sections by a wall, and this wall came up only about halfway
between the two stage areas, so the left side was a practice area and the right
side was the actual stage, and there was a gap in this dividing wall and the
back wall for the little actors and actresses to walk between, and if you were
on the top area in the middle along the same line as the dividing wall, you
could see both stages. The practice stage didn't have as many seats, and didn't
raise up as high, and I seem to remember it was lit way better as the actual
stage area had more "dramatic stage lighting". So that was that.

The other thing I remember about this whole thing, which isn't really worth
taking note of in the dream, but I remember a person, female, who was exactly
like the person I remember from Kinley's irl stage production. The memory I
have of her is that she empathized with her child, who was making a fuss when
she tried to put her hair all tight into a bun and put her in these absurd
clothes and etc, and she put words into her fussing child like "I am actually
three, I'm three and you're making me do this." She said this to us as she was
explaining her difficulty, and her empathy, with the situation, which is an
interesting sort of psychological thing going on.

So yeah, I wanted to get these dreams out, because they are both wholly
forgettable, and I already just in the thirty minutes after waking forgot a lot
of details, as I know if I remembered these dreams better I could have filled
an entire article as I have in the past, but right now I don't want to speak of
dreams anymore but I want to read some Shakespeare, so I am going to do that,
and I am certain I will come back to write some more. I just got the idea that
my two Christians will be similar in their faith as my Grandfather and
Grandmother, in that they are together, and they both are Christian, but they
have very different views of Christianity, but they share their love in spite
of that. I have also thought of the two athiests to be lovers like that as
well. I want to interview all of them later, but right now I don't feel like I
have quite the inspiration or interest to do that, it would feel more like a
chore than discovery, so I will take a break, have a bit of my day, and come
back to that later.

So I'm back, now with coffee, so we will so how this writing thing turns out
now that I have some stimulant to fuel me. So let's start with something of an
idea I have for a story.

So this is the same idea I've had for a long time, I don't know why I said it
as if it is a new story. However, I like this idea because it is a new one in
the context of the story. So I want this to be a group of five friends, two
couples and a single guy. The couples will be a christian couple and an athiest
couple, and then a single dude. Now, the story will be surrounding the group of
four, the two couples, who decide to go on a remote getaway to an old hermitage
from really old times, like old. You get it. Old. And this is the hermatiage of
my hermit that I have wrote about before.

So the reason that these two couples are going on this get away is to get away
from the death of their fifth friend, Brett. The exact nature of Brett's death,
I don't really know. If I wanted to make this autobiographical, I would say
Brett died due to a stroke of the brain, that caused first numbness in his left
arm, and he didn't seek help soon enough, so he died. I kind of like this
because it is familiar, but at the same time it's like, anyone who might read
this would say "Oh, I see, so this Brett is actually you, I see what you are
doing." In fact, I only call him Brett now just because I want it to be clear
that this character is the one that most represents me, and I want him to be
dead, so that this story is indeed an autobiographical account.

I have also come up with four names for my characters, Peter, Madison, Ann, and
Gene. However, I really hate this because these characters I want to be
entirely fictional, so naming them after people I am so intimately familiar
would be wrong. Also, I don't think the roles that these people irl fit into my
life irl are the roles I want them to fit in the story, they just don't match
up like that I don't think. So Nix that idea. I want to start with my interview
of Dmitri. Now I don't like Dmitri because he is too close to the name of the
character in a Brothers Karamazov, actually identiacally so, so I like the idea
of something Russian sounding, but americanized. What would be the american
version of Dmitiri? Non-biblically speaking. David is what comes to mind, but I
don't want that to be biblical. Michael also comes to mind, but that is also
biblical. So how about Devin. That's closer to what I want. It's a little too
close to devil though for my liking, so I don't like that as much. How about
Derek. I like Derek. But at the same time I don't, it's a little harsh, and I
want his personality to be harsh but not his name. There needs to be an "l" in
there. But not Darrell. Damien. That's the best I have come up with so far.
Damien. But the group calls him "Mani". So I have my character named Damien,
nicknamed Mani. I like that.

Okay, now how about his girlfriend. She has to have a name like Katerina. But I
don't like Katarina exactly, although I like the fact that it has a lot of
syllables. Let's talk about her for a bit. Let me interview her. So, what do
you do?

I don't know what she does. She is an organizer, and event planner. Similar to
Lacey irl. For hospitals. She enjoys helping those that can't help themselves.
How did you grow up? She never knew her father. She likes Damien, and she is
devoted to him. She is very unpromiscuous. She wears modest clothing, never
revealling herself, but still. She is the Kim from my dreams. Kimberly is her
name. But in her group of friend everyone calls her Kimber. I don't like Kim
because that is Jason's mother, and I don't want to tie that aspect into this
story, but I know a Kim, and I like for her to represent my dream version of
her, so Kimber I think fits with the theme here.

I like this discovery process of names, it's doing it for me. Damien and
Kimberly, or Mani and Kimber, are two. Who are the others.

Well, we know Brett, that one is not changing. How about the other two. I
actually really like Ann for the female of that side, as she represents that
for me.

How about Grant for the other one? I don't like that name, even though Grant
irl fits the character of this person very well. Perhaps its because of that
that I don't want to name him Grant. I don't want him to be associated with
Grant. You see, I don't want to write about Grant, I want to write about this
fictionaly character, who has a personality similar to Grant's but is entirely
his own person. What is his name? His name is simple, one or two syllables. Not
something complicated. I don't think I should name my other character Ann for
the same reason I shouldn't name this one Grant. However, I want each of their
names to be simple. So for this character, let's just start with Grant and
start mophing it with Timothy, and go from there. Grant Trotter, Timothy
Hoffman. Grantothy. Timant. Tigothy. Prant. Frant. This character is the
opposite of Damien. So what is the sort of opposite of Damien philologically?
"Dah" is a sort of hard sound, so a softer sound would be something like
Lyganov. Very russian. Indeed, I like the duality of Russian, that is something
that is missing in English very sorely. Soft and hard, voiced and non-voiced,
english doesn't have these things. It makes coming up with names more difficult
than it should be. Lyse. I like Lyse. That might be it. Is that the nickname or
is that the full name? Lyse. Lyse. I like that. Lyse.

So Lyse is newlywed to this woman. I think they are newlywed anyway. Actually,
I think they are just dating. Perhaps they are engaged. Newly engaged. That
might be better. Lyse is struggling with his Christianity. In fact, this whole
notion of flat earth, and Lyse coming to accept it, I think creates a rift
between Lyse and his girlfriend, whose name is not coming to me at the moment,
that they end up breaking up. So who would be the girlfriend of Lyse. This
girlfriend would also be a sort of mirror of Kimberly. Or Kimbo, as they
sometimes call her, although she doesn't like that. And she really doesn't like
Kim, legitimately doesn't like Kim, although she secrectly likes Kimbo, but she
likes it because she like to tease people for calling her that, that weird
pardoxical liking of something like that. So the foil to Kimbo, or Kimberly,
would be a harsh name. Indeed, this character is quite the hypocrite. She could
have a very proper name like Margeret, although that name isn't right. I like
Maggie. Maggie is pretty close to the mark, although the name Maggie doesn't
quite pull up the image I want.

This girl, she is the sort that wears old timey clothing in order to break the
norms of fashion, and she wears it always in a very modern way, in a way that
would appall the people who wore such clothing when it was fashionable.
Actually, appall is not the right word, it would be wholy unfashionable to
those who would have worn it in their time. She would wear it in such a way to
display her old-fashioned-ness, but ironically, it would be out of fashion for
those who wore it when it was in fashion. Clothes that her grandmother might
have worn, but worn in a way that her Grandmother would not have found
fashionable in her time. So instead they are clothes that she has the
perception that her Grandmother might have worn, but if she ever asked her
Grandmother what she thought of the clothing, the grandmother would say that it
was just off in a way to make it peculiar. So in this way, she should wear old
fashioned clothes, but in a modern way, and in a similar way, her name should
be somewhat old fashioned, but in a modern way. Similar to how Everly is an
old-fashioned sounding name but is used for my now four year old niece. Now, of
course, I don't want to use the word Everly, as I don't want this character to
be about my niece, so instead I need to come up with a different old fashioned
name, but put a modern spin on it.

So beatrix is an old fashioned name. How could one put a modern spin on
Beatrix? How about Beet? That is too obscure and made up. I am trying to thing
of some variation of Beatrix that is a mirror to Kimberly. Bee and Ki. Beatya,
a very Russian sounding name. Витя. I like that, transliteratted to Veetya. But
that is again too Russian, but I like where this is going. How about Beetrix?
That is too close to Beatrix, and people would wonder why she was not named
Beatrix. So how about Veatya? I keep coming back to the Russian я ending, which
makes the name much too Russian. So lets stray from that and think of some
american names. Racheal. I actually really like Racheal, and I know that it is
a biblical name, but not near as recognizable as Micheal or David were. Rachey
could be her nickname. Something like that. I like Racheal though. I'm not sure
how to spell that. But Racheal is good. About as good as it is going to get.
Lyse and Racheal. I don't like Racheal entiely, I need the modern spin on it.
Maybe she likes to say it as RuSHELL with the emphasis on the ending, and
that's her mordern spin on it. I like Shelly as her nickname. Racheall and
Shelly, girlfriend of Lyse. And Damien and Kimberly. I like these names. They
are the best I can come up with for now.

Names are hard man, and I haven't even come up with surnames. I will not give
these characters surnames until I have written more about them.

I will get more coffee.

Okay, I'm back and I have more coffee.

So now I want to start to interview my characters. I will start with Damien, or
Mani or Mitee as his girlfriend might call him.

So Damien, tell me a bit about your upbringing?

Yeah, sure, so I was born in what you would call not the best of circumstances,
but not the worst of circumstances either.

Okay, tell me about your parents first then.

At this, Damien gave a sort of scoff, as though the topic of his parents was
not one that he wanted to touch upon. "Well, I'll tell you about my parents,
although I don't really like either of them. I grew up as most boys do, going
to school and getting good grades. I would get in trouble in school for the
most silly things, like making a ruccus in the back with the other boys, and
being disrupted in class, but being sent to the principles office only made him
(I have transition to describing him, as I don't think Damien would have the
sort of self-awareness to answer how I want) would only make him more bitter of
the rules set forth by the school. He got good marks on all his grades,
espically those he didn't consider "stupid" but on the subjects he didn't like,
he would get poorer grades, not because he couldn't learn the material, but
because he had no interest in, as he might put it, "Learning something so
stupid as the date that Joan of Arc was burned at the stake." He would get
reprimanded by this from his parents, and at this he would continue to stay his
ground that those things were stupid, but he would begin to put effort into
them not because he felt is was the right thing to do or because he began to
see any value in them, rather he put effort into them because putting effort
into those things was less burden on his life than the grief he would get from
his parents of the poor marks he would get, so he would put only as much effort
as needed into those subject to get better marks, and nothing more. He would
even go so far as to intentionally put less effort into those subjects even
when he started to find them at least midly interesting, perhaps out of spite
of his parents or because he wanted his grades to reflect not his abilities,
because his abilities he knew in himself to be above that of all of his peers,
but because he wanted at least at some subconcious level for his grades to
represent his interest in certain subjects. So he recieved high marks in the
maths and the sciences, as he enjoyed those subjects, but intenionally would
get lower marks in the historys and the "softer studies" as he might have
called them.

His parents were both devout Christian's but devout in all the wrong ways. They
would pray at every meal, and when Damien would inquire about the prayers,
asking why it was neccesary to thank God for the food when it clearly came from
the supermarket, his parents would say something as silly as "because
everything comes from god and if we don't thank him for it he might become
angry, and we don't want God to be angry at us". Indeed, his parents might not
have said something as ridiclous as this, but that was certainly the sort of
motivation that they had for their Chirstianity. When Damien would inquire
about the reason for dressing up and going to church on Sunday, his parents
would say, "Becaus we have to give god our best on his day." and when Damien
might ask why Sunday in particular was "God's day" his parents would say
"Because God made Sunday his day in the bible, so that's the way it is." and
dismiss Damien's further points, reckoning that he was a simple child and that
maybe when he was older he would stop asking such childly questions.

And all these things, the blessing of the food, the going to church, and all of
the other things Damien had to do growing up, he would always resist them, but
never to the point of angering his parents, because they were pretty well off,
and angering his parents in such a way he was at least wise enough to realize,
even if he did not explictly realize it, he must have realized internally that
angering his parents in this way would give no benefit to him, and he was
better off appeasing them for things like Christmas and Easter and Sunday
church, and ignoring them completely, so that he could busy himself with other
things.

In fact, on the church bulliten, he would write math problems down during the
sermons, and solve them, and he would work out physics problems with the little
pencils that the church offers there for offering, and he would use those tools
to put together little puzzles to occupy his brain while the pastor would speak
of this or that or something else, and in so doing he would occupy himself
with things he enjoyed, and not bother his parents with how silly this whole
thing was.

When Damien went off to college, his natural course of action was in physics,
and his parents enjoyed this about him and would say things between themselves
like "maybe his study of physics will lead him to see that science can't
explain God, and in so doing he will come to see God in his own time." Indeed,
both of Damien's parents were worried about his salvation, and they felt that
he needed more time in school. Any time Damien would call and visit his
parents, he would like about an extracurricular bible study he was attending to
his parents, just because he knew it would ease there mind about his salvation,
when in reality he was going to an athiest meeting, where they would talk about
the ridiculuosness of Christianity, and all of the logical fallacies of the
bible, and he would use his experience in those meetings to fabricate the dual
of what a Christian bible study would be like, and would tell his parents about
that. And he never felt bad about lying to his parents about it, "Indeed, if
there really is no Hell, and I firmly believe that there is not, why shouldn't
I lie to my parents? It's easier for me in this world, and it won't make any
difference when I'm dead, so I will lie about it."

Damien first met Kimberly in one of his introductory physics classes. He saw
her sitting there taking notes on it very studiously as he sat in the back with
his laptop occupying himself with other things. Even undergraduate work came
easily to Damien, and he was glad at the opportunity to skip his classes
without demerit. In fact, he would many times make a game of it and skip as
many lectures as he could just to see how many he could skip and still get good
grades, and to his pleasue he realized that he could skip quite a few, and
indeed when it came to these mandatory introductory courses which he dreaded,
he could skip nearly all of them and still make satisfactory marks, so he would
do so and focus himself on other things.

Actually, my history is incorrect I think. Indeed, Damien had not met Kimberly
at all during his undergraduate time, and by the time he had graduated, he had
already been accepted into the graduate physics program at another university,
and he acquired a position as Teachers Assistant there. And at this, he was
grateful for the opportunity to help pay for his tutition with work there, but
now he was required not only to attend his graduate lectures (which now he
graciously attended because, as he put it, "it's like they finally recognize
that I want to learn something interesting") but now, to his distaste, he was
required by his professors to attend the introductory courses which he was
meant to provide grades for. And he hated this, but after speaking with his
professors on it, they conceded that he would be allowed to bring his graduate
work in with him to the lectures to work on, and at this he would do so and
wholly ignore (or obtain the lecture through osmosis, as he so put it) the
lectures, and work on his studies through there.

And it was in one of these classes, as teachers assistent, that he first came
across Kimberly.

Now, all through this time, I have failed to talk of Damien's interest in the
other sex, and I think it is my own lack of interaction with the other sex that
I fail to understand these interactions. Because Damien to this point, I would
say, was quite the smooth talker when it came to women. He was the sort that
would come to a woman, and say all of the things that knew that they wanted to
hear from him, so that he could have sex with them, and then after having sex
with them, he would elect to go his own way with them.

In fact, now that I think on it, perhaps in undergraduate school, he did
actually attend the bible studies, but only sporadically, and when he did, he
would pretend to be an anguished soul, someone seeking salvation, and
constantly at odds with the nature of God and of the universe. In this attitude
he began to notice that the women loved this sort of anguish in him, and he
would use this to speak to them. He did not call himself a pick up artist in
this way, but he loved toying with the women in that area who he knew to be
"good studious Christians" because he knew that they could surrender themselves
to him, but as soon as they did, and he got the pleasure from them that he
wanted, he would move on about himself. He would never wholly reject them, as
he knew if he was rude to them after he would have sex with them, word would
get around that he was an asshole and a douche, and he didn't want to be
labeled as such, but after he was done with them, he would discard them by
proclaiming that he was busy with his studies, and he would lie about not
getting good marks, and needing to study more, and he would constantly go over
things like this, saying thing to make them want to seperate themselves from
him. They would surrender themselves at first, but he would then make himself
unattractive to them. His fake anguished soul would become all to clear to
these women, but not so clear that they saw through his disguise, but only
clear enough to the point that they would realize that this is not the sort of
man you take home to meet your father, and he would seperate himself more and
more from them, until they would be the ones to break it off with him. And when
they did, he would pretend as though he were still anguishing over it, feigning
to be a tortured soul but trying to come to terms with that, and saying that he
understood that they each needed to find their own path in the ways of the
Lord. And all of these things would be wholly fake to him, and real to her, and
he did these things to keep his reputation in these circles as an anguished
soul.

His favorite time, he noticed, was at the begginning of each semester, when new
freshmen girls who were suddenly placed into this new environment of college
would be looking for an anchor. He knew many of these girls would have had high
school boyfriends, and that these girls would be "trying long distance" for a
time after their highschool graduation with these boys, and he would make
conversation with them, and reach their souls. He would find each one like a
new challenge, like a code to be cracked, and he quite enjoyed making these
girls fall for him in their loneliness and wont for their long distance
boyfriend, this boyfriend who they were uncertain of and would have sparse
communication with. He much enjoyed, at least for some time, cracking these
girls, and getting to them, and whole spoiling these long-distance
relationships. He found it like a game, and he would spend much of his time
amusing himself in this way, at least until he acheived his end, and then he
would grow bored of it, and continue back to his other puzzles and games that
amused him.

However, coming to graduate school, he decided that the time for those games
was over, at least for the time. He would still look back on them with
fondness, but he decided that he wanted to come to a girl who was not Christian
and that he could have a true intellectual conversation with as an equal.

And so it came by chance, as he was grading papers, he would come across this
Kimberly. On a certain one, he began to grade it, and as he did, he thought
with contempt how horrible it was that so many people could fail so
maginificently at introductory physics. And as he was grading such a paper,
marking it with a judicious red ink as he felt that his obligations as a TA
were a complete waste of time in light of what he could be studying, he saw at
the bottom of it there were simply 10 digits. Now, as he looked back, and saw
that this particular homework assignment was very neatly written, and that the
mathematics of it was so well spelled out that it could have only been made by
someone who had quite an unintutive notion of physics. This person would write
out all of the relevent formula's that were taught in class, formulas which
Damien knew to be true but would never bother to memorize, and at the top of
each problem were all of the relevent formulas, and then a very rote and
laborious transcription of those formualas into the forms they needed for that
problem. And as he graded this paper, he would find some mistakes in this
work, not mistakes in the transcription, as he would notice that the
transciptions were always correct strictly speaking, but those transciptions
would not match the nature of the problem at all, and instead would simply be
transcriptions of the formulas that she might have seen in class, and not
having an understanding of the principles of physics, but instead having a
strong ability to listen and memorize, she would apply the wrong transcription
exactly in the precise way that made the answer very precisely wrong. As he
looked back over his notes of this work, after seeing the ten digits, and
noticing the name of Kimberly on the top, he decided to go back through and
give more points off for her partially correct answers. This gave him a similar
pleasue to the pleasure he would find at seducing the Christian women, and he
elected that he would not call the ten digit number, but instead let her come
to him if she truly wanted to understand physics.

And sure enough, after he did this, know that it was indeed wrong, but always
justifying himself with that same statement, "if there is no devil then I
might as well act as one even if it is for my own amusement" after he had done
this, this Kimberly came to his office with that very same paper, and asked why
it was so harshly graded. Indeed, as before he would mark her off for her
partially correct answers, but this one was marked exceptionally harshly, and
she wanted to come to him to understand why. And so, to his amusement, he began
to talk to her in this way, talking down to her, telling her of all the wrong
things that were on it, and of all the ways it should have been write. "Indeed,
it is in my notes on the paper what exactly is wrong, what more could you want
of me?" and at this she would say, "I want to understand, what is it I don't
understand?" and he would say, "You see, you have a habit of writing formulas
and deriving equations in a very rote way, instead you should start with what
you think should be the way of the soulution based on your intution of the
principles, and working backwards you should arrive at the original formulas,
using the formualas to verify your intution, or rather, to forge and strengthen
your intutition." Much to Damien's surprise, he gave her a great lecture on
the white board there, going over the very basics of physics with her in the
most interesting of ways. And Damien found in himself something which he hadn't
been able to find before. After going over the principles, and going over it in
many different ways, to try and see if she would understand, she would ask him
more questions, questions which indicated to him that she wasn't understanding
fully what she was saying, and he would constantly have to remind her "No no,
this is not something you can memorize, it is something you have to understand,
let me see if I can explain in a different way," and he would try and imagine a
different way to explain to her, first using imagery and geometry, then using
philosophy and rigor, and using every analogy and story and thought experiment
that he could conjure up, because he could tell that this girl wanted to
understand, but had never been taught how to understand, and understanding had
come to Damien naturally, and in trying to teach this girl how to understand,
he had to go through the process of understanding which he blazed through in
his youth, and in re imagining this, he had to go through a process in a way
that he had never had to struggle with, but he could see this girl struggling
with it, and most of the time when he saw this, when he saw people struggling,
he would simply label them in his head as "unintelligent" but he saw that this
girl was very much not unintelligent, but was instead intellgent on a very
different spectrum than in the intellegence that he had, and he wanted to helf
he see the intellegence and the process which he would have gone through if he
were unintelligent, and in this way Damien could see that she genuinely wanted
to learn from him, and to tap into his potential. Damien found this profound in
a way, and before he realized it he had gone through this one howework, which
had only three simple problems, all problems which were based on one
fundamental principle of physics that to him he found so rudimentary, but he
finally understood the struggle of it through this girl, this Kimberly. He
could finally understand the struggle. He knew the struggle, but he had never
witnessed it in such an innocent way as this girl. And before he realized, he
had spent over an hour and a half trying to answer these girls questions,
because she had interesting questions, on this one simple principle, and when
they were done, she asked him if she had seen her number at the bottom of the
paper, and Damien said that he had, but that he doesn't date students. At this
she said "Okay, I understand" and left the room, but this had a profound effect
on Damien, and he noticed that when he got back to his graduate studies, and
went back to the problem he was working on before she came into his office,
when he came back to his "more interesting" work, the sort of work when people
would ask him "what are you working on" he would say, almost taking pride in
his pompousness "physics stuff that has so much math it would bore you" so as
to seperate those who asked the question and ostracize them (Damien enjoyed
ostracizing people in this way) he found that he was able to approach his "high
level" problems from a different angle, from an angle that would not have
occured to him before.

And so, this Kimberly continued to come to Damien's office, and Damien would
continue to grow more and more fond of her as the days went on. However, I do
want to note that, while he did grow fond of this Kimberly, he always thought
of her on a different level then himself. Indeed, Damien thought of her as a
tool, to be used, and he never truely would open himself up to her. Something
he might say to himself, when they began dating a few months later, after she
had passed his class and she was no longer his student, something he might say
to himself but not to her and not even to his friends, would be, "I date her
and I have interest in her for my own benefit, and the fact that she seems to
benefit from it to is only a happy coincidence." Indeed, let it be known that
while they dated, many times he would grow wearisome and abusive towards her,
not neccesarily in a physical way, but in the same way that he would make
himself distant from the Christian girls during his undergraduate years, he
would make himself distant from Kimberly, and while he would sometimes see the
great benefit of explaining her undergraduate studies in the topics that he
didn't understand, he would also find such a thing to be a chore at other
times. "Why should I help her with her Chemistry homework if it doesn't help me
with my studies" would be something he would say, and at times he would shrug
her off when he felt that she was being to needy. However, and this is
something that I also want to make clear, she would not put up with his shit
either, and when she felt that Damien was getting into this sort of mood, she
would distance herself from him as well. This gave Damien a great perplexity,
and indeed, whether he explictly realized it or not, was the sole reason that
they were able to continue to date.

However, these things have more to do with Kimberly than they do with Damien,
and I only mention them to paint more clearly Damien's perception of his
relationship with Kimberly. I want it to be clear that he was not "converted"
or anything of that sort by his relationship with Kimberly, merely I want to
impress upon the reader that this relationship was simply a rather remarkable
one that fit into Damien's view of relationships in a quite remarkable way, in
the sense that this was the sort of relationship that actually lasted in his
selfish and self-centered view of the world, and the only sort of relationship
that could have lasted for that time.

That I think is enough on Damien for now. I think I have quite discovered
Damien to my liking, and I like how his relationship with both women and with
Kimberly has evolved. I am not sure who I would like to discover next, but that
is not for me to decide at this time. I have done quite enough discovering, and
I think it is time for me to wind down a bit and read some.

Indeed, coffee is quite a great drug for these endeavors, and I dare say that
it is quite the stimulant for this sort of thought. I would like, at some
point, to experiment with loose leaf tobacco, and to smoke that to my liking
and see in what way I can enjoy that perhaps at first on its own and then later
in combination with the coffee, and see what sort of effects that has on my
creativity and my imagination. I am cautiously optimistic about the effects it
might have as such, and look forward to seeing what it may be.

I may write more today, but most likely not. If I do write, it will most
certianly not be anything about discovery, but instead about what I come to
read. I must be very careful with coffee, and confine myself to only indulging
in it sparingly. In fact, I think every weekend might be too often, as this
does have a great effect on my mind right now, and I can see how, if
over-indulged, one can grow quite a depenance on it, and I certainly don't want
that. I shall see, and take the utmost care in with this substance.

# 20180715 Effects of the coffee - Musings on Government
So yesterday was an interesting day for me. The whole, let's drink a bunch of
coffee thing allowed me to focus in on and create the above article like I did,
which I have not as yet read back to myself yet, but after that it left me in
quite a strange state. I started reading Dante's inferno, the translation I got
from the store just yesterday, and I read the whole introduction as one does
(or rather as I do) when in such a cafinated state, with supreme haste, but
focus, all at the same time, and I think I even continued to drink some more as
I was reading it. Eventually, however, I got to the point where I quickly began
to realize that, maybe drinking a half a gallon of coffee is too much for one
day, and it was becoming five o clock and six o clock and I was still finishing
the last of my last cup for the day, and eventually I elected to make a
smoothie, the kale smoothies that I have been making as late, and I made that
smoothie, and continued to drink the coffee, and I began to discover what
people talk of when they talk of coffee making their stomach uneasy, because in
that time my stomach was becoming quite uneasy, and I was still having my out
of body sort of experinces that I have when I drink coffee, and all the rest,
and I began to come about my inclination towards coffee. I remember thinking
"wow, this is what alcoholics must feel when they say to themselves 'I'm never
drinking again' and then the next day they do" because I had the inclination
like I had gained quite a lot from the consumption of the coffee, and during
the whole high of that stimulant, I remember thinking "I wonder if I could do
this both Saturday and Sunday and not have to worry about dependence." but then
later in that day I was thinking "I am never drinking coffee again" in a sort
of tongue in cheek sort of way. And lo and behold, I tell you, when I finally
did get to sleep, at around 2, and I had a dreamless sleep, I woke up around
11, and not soon after that I was thinking about how a cup of coffee, to put
myself into the focused state of yesterday would be nice, and I immediately
shurgged at myself for having forseen this entire thing, so I elected rather
just to do the things that I wanted the coffee to give me focus on, rather than
releing on the coffee to give me that crutch, and I continued to read some
Hamlet. I will say though, the out of body feeling that coffee gives persisted
today, and I still felt the after effects of the substance in my body, so
coffee is indeed quite the drug, and it's amazing to me that so many people
will indulge themselves to it without knowledge of it effects on their body.
What un-enlightened lives we all lead.

Regardless, I don't want to dwell on coffee or substance or anything of that
sort. Today, I have the strangest inclination, for whatever reason, to talk
about the concepts of government. I don't know what compells me to speak so,
because quite frankly I don't really have any particular thoughts that I find I
have to get out on paper, but I feel like writing about it none-the-less, and
so that is what I will do.

So to start I think, I want to take two angles. The second angle I want to take
will have to do with staring at the very root of it, and discovering in a way a
sort of evolutionary line of government that could have taken place from the
history of our evolution from monkey people to wandering nomadic tribes people
to agrigultural farmers to the city state structure we have today. However,
before I do that, I have a few comments about terms that I think have taken a
sort of meaning of their own that is entirely apart from the meaning they were
originally etymologized from. (Is that a word? I don't care) So here it goes.

The most common terms you will hear in our system of government, here in
America, are the terms Democrat and Republican. And I think a lot of people
have the notion that these terms refer to peoples stance on some current issues
today. So, for example Democrats will be pro-choice while republicans will be
pro-life, and democrats will be pro-gay marraige, and republicans will be
pro-marriage as an institution of god, and etc etc with other such issues,
things like illegal immigration, forigen policy, and etc etc. However, when one
looks at the roots of these words, a very different sort of notion of what one
is in relation to the other appears.

A democrat would be one who is a proponent of democracy, one that believes that
the popular vote of the people should determine where our policies should go.
Within this sphere of democrats there could be different sub-sections that have
to do with those that believe in each voice having equal weight, those that
feel different groups should have equal weight, and also the concept of to what
extent this should be taken. For example, I think most would agree that
startegic choices taken in war time should not go to the popular vote of the
citizens of the people, but there might be some who would argue for such a
thing as well. Such an argument is sort of silly in my mind, although I could
see how it could be attractive to some who don't look deeply into such things.
For instance, you could say "perhaps the soldiers who are storming a facility
disagree on a direct approach, or a stealthy approach, and if they disagree,
perhaps they should take a popular vote amongst themselves to decide which way
they should go upon." Indeed, that would be one way to settle that
disagreement, but such a stategem is clearly not the ideal scenario, and those
that have better systems in place would out maneuver and thus bring about the
"survival of the fittest" or rather, "death to the unfit" in that system.
However, when it comes to policies such as "should women be allowed to abort
their unborn fetuses." such an issue some believe should go to the popular vote
of all those who are involved in such a thing, and it's not nearly as clear
whether this is an appropiate way of governing.

Now, in this way I am showing my bias here, as I feel the popular vote of the
people should never have divine power. Certainly, the voice of the masses will
have some effect of what actually plays out in the world, but the concept that
democracy is some sort of gold standard that any free society should strive to
(and in this sentence alone we have so many vague concepts that are so ill
defined by many), that is absurd. I digress on my topic a bit, because the
government of democracy has it's place in certain aspects, but even in those I
feel that it is ill suited and less than ideal a system of government.

Alas, when I start talking about these things, I always feel the need to define
the terms I use, and in this one is no different. Because in talking of
government, I still haven't even defined what a government is. Of course, in
this day and age, we associate the word "Government" with "the instiution of
elected and appointed officials of the American government put in place by the
constitution of the United States" or some other such anagolous definition, but
that falls short of what I mean when I say government. Surely that falls within
the concept of "something that Governs" which is what the dictionary would have
to say about government, but "our government" is only one instance of what a
government could be. So let's stop beating the bush and get to what I mean when
I say government.

When I saw government, what I mean is this. A government is a way of organizing
any group of smaller sub-units into a larger unit, usually with some aim in
mind. The nature of that aim varies by the system of government that is being
applied, but the concept of organizing a group of sub-units into a bigger unit,
and the methods and application of doing so, is what I mean when I say
government. So, for instance, in order to illustrate some distinctions here, I
want to make an example. Suppose a man wholly undisciplined is fat and out of
shape, but he decides to pull himself together, sticks to a diet, applies a
workout regiment, and loses weight. The losing weight is not the government,
that is the aim of the government. Also, the diet and the exercise regiment,
those thing are also not the government, those would be the policies that his
government has enactted, although to blur the distinction at this level would
not be a very large folly. The government of this man, rather, is that which
"pulls him into shape" in this way. It wolud be his brain, the neurons that
fire, that put together all of the things, all of the policies and aims and all
of that, to get up off the couch and into the gym.

A tyranical government, in this sense, would be if this man would say to
himself, "Jim, you are fat, you are ugly, and I don't care about any of your
fleshly desires, this is what we are doing and you have no say in the matter"
and in such a way he would force himself to go against his will and enact a
diet.

You can also imagine a purely democratic government, which is coincidentally
(the kind of co-incidence that is co-generated) the kind of government that I
think a lot of people take when it comes to their every day activities. A
person enacting a democratic government would say this, "Well, part of me wants
to lay on the couch, and part of me wants to work out, and part of me wants to
get up and eat more food, and part of me wants to call be friend and see if he
wants to go to the bar, so I'm going to take a vote and see which one wins" and
in this way this man could govern himself. Now, this man could be in such a
forturate position as to me the sort of person that likes to workout and that
portion of him always wins, but if he is not such a person, and indeed in our
luxiourous life style that we live here in america, most people are not, that
portion of him will not win, and instead he will get up and get more food and
eat that food, and so doing he will give in to his basest of desires. Such a
lifestyle border-lines on hedonism, but hedonism is slightly different, and
something that I could get into but feel would be too tangent to the discussion
at hand.

Something I want to make note of as well is, every government will have some
sort of all of these concepts imbued within them. There is no "purely
tyranical" government, as the voice of the people, no matter how fierce or
clever the tyrant, will always in some way effect the actions of the tryant.

In fact, something also I want to say, is that all of these forms of
government are restricted by the laws of science in nature. A successful
dictator ship is dependent on mob psychology, and without that, and without
methods put in place to instill things such as fear of rebellion and quell
things such as independenth thought, such a government will not hold its own
for very long, and the dictator will not last.

So in that sense, we could say that anarchy is the most base form of
government. In fact, to call Anarchy a government would be like calling some
analogy that makes sense here. (I can't think of an appropiate analogy at the
time and don't want to dwell on it) What I am trying to get at is anarchy only
a relation to government in that it is the complete lack of government. It is
what happens when you let the sub-units each act on their own accord, and "let
the chips fall where they may".

And something I want to say at this point, democracy is only one step above
anarchy. Anarchy is like saying "Everyone has a voice, and the one's with the
loudest and strongest voices get to say what we do" where as Democracy is the
enforcment that "everyone has a voice, and we want to make sure that the weak
and little voices are enhanced and the strong and powerful voices are dampened,
so that all of the voices are equal". And you can see how much enforcment such
a thing must take.

Indeed, maybe that's the only difference between democracy and anarchy.
Democracy is simply anarchy without heirarchy. But that is much to harsh a
critcism to democracy (or maybe it is to much a praise of anarchy, although I
am more inclined to the former)

So enough on democracy, I wanted to get to more definitions, and I have gone
completely off on tangents about democracy. So lets talk about what it means to
be republican.

A republican, traditionally and etymologically speaking, is one that believes
that the policies put forth should be decided by those most knowledgeable about
the effects and implications of those policies, and in so doing, this panel of
experts will decide, each in their appropiate place, what our policies should
be.

So this system of government sound all well and dandy, and we can all agree
that having people knowledgeable of the implications of their action should be
the ones who are given the power to make those decisions, but there is one big
flaw with this system. That is, who gets to decide who is the expert on
something? And in that way, the republican system is so much more interesting
than the democratic one of "just give the people a voice and do what they say",
but this interestingness makes things difficult when there is such a large
group of people who all have different opinions about what "well-being" means.

And indeed, that comes to the crux of the issue as well. It's one thing on
deciding a system of government when all of the sub-unit's are agreed on what
the aim of the government should be, but when the sub-units are not in
agreement, how can one even begin to form a government which seeks to aim
towards an amorphous goal?

I think this is where the concepts of democracy and the concepts of the
republic can meet. The democracy can be used to determine "what is the aim of
our government" and the republic can say "this is the best means to acheive
that aim" and these two together can merge and we can all be great.

But this is a gross oversimplification, for a multitude of reasons. The first,
is that, even if some majority agree on a certain aim, the concept of "a
majority want this to be our aim, so that is our aim" is really quite
misguided. Why should it not be the experts who know "what the aim should be"
that get to decide our aim?

Going back to our example of the fat man, a majority of him, his fat cells, his
atrophied muscles, his stomach bacteria, all of those things say, "our aim is
for the increased consumption of sugary foods so that we might use them and
store more fat for ourselves", while only perhaps his tummy aches and
out-of-breathness he feels when he eats would be the only things saying "we
should seek to overcome our sedentary nature and strive to be more active". In
this way it is a majority that says that he should stay on the couch and keep
eating, and so if we allowed democracy to control our aim like that, this is
the downfall of it.

I am getting to a rambly point, and don't feel very inclined to continue on
this whole train of thought. Basically, where my thoughts take me is this. I
feel that democracy is a wholly inadequate system of government, and while the
concept of bringing things to a popular vote when many of the individual units
disagree on something is one way to resolve some of the most trivial of
policies, I feel that it fails on many levels and that there will always be a
better way of doing things.

# 20180716 Recovery from coffee - Hamlet - Diet - Visit with dad and Jason - Rape of the maiden of Truth
So it's quite facsinating, I still feel like I am recovering from my
consumption of 2 liters of coffee that happened over 48 hours ago. Yesterday,
before I went to bed, I was still hopelessly trying to figure out why I felt so
despaired, and today, I have felt that same despair, as though everything I am
doing is not good enough, and that I need something, that I'm missing
something, and that my life is incomplete.

Now, a lot of this has to do with my lack of marijuana lately. Actually, the
lack of marijuana is certainly not what causes this feeling for me, but it is
something that I know helps me work through it and get past it. It's amazing,
how when I am under the influence of that drug, I see things in such a
different way, in a way where I don't need to see the "intrisic value" in the
thing that I do, and instead I just appreciate it for what it is. However, when
I am not smoking, when I am wholly sober from the substance like I am now, and
when I get into this sort of mood like I am feeling now, I have thing feeling
like everything I do has to have some sort of intrisic or trancendental value,
or else that thing is not worth doing, so I get paralyzed in my ways. And when
I try and do the things that have satiate my appetite for the "trancendental"
or the "intrinsic" and I decide I just want to do them "for their own sake" so
that I can "fake it till you make it" to use that worn out expression, when I
go through the motions of for instance practicing a new piece on the piano, or
reading some novel, or writing like I am now, instead of relieving that
pressure I feel, instead it just feels more heavy, or at the very least the
same amount of heavy, and I don't feel any better but I simply feel more
exhausted, and now matter how much I try and tell myself to get through that
feeling of exhaustion and trust in the thing that I'm doing, in the end it
still feels pointless and meaningless, and I come out on the other side saying
"usually that makes me feel better, but it didn't, and now I am exhausted", but
I'm exhausted in a way that doesn't make me tired, I'm exhausted in the way
that makes me hungry for meaning, for purpose, and I can't find it.

So yeah, enough with that piece of shit run on sentance.

--

Yesterday, I experimented with something, and I talked about it I think in my
entry yesterday, and that was going for a one mile jog a few times throughout
the day. I did this in between readings of the acts of Hamlet, and in so doing
I was able to dismiss myself of that feeling I get when I read too much and my
brain says "stop reading, I don't care how interesting the book is" and it
allowed be to put partitions on my brain in that way, to distract it so I could
bypass that filter and go back to reading.

So yeah, I do sort of want to give a brief impression of the work of Hamlet,
and what I thought of it.

So I have the very common criticism of Hamlet, the criticism that I think most
students who are required to read the work have, that Hamlet himself is quite
unbearable. I think that is the point, to explore the emotions of someone who
has been built with the silver spoon in his mouth, and he is forced to confront
something so debasing as a murder of his father by his incestous brother, and
it explores the sort of madness that one who has never had hardships before has
to go through at such an event. He has young love, in Ophelia, and that he
destroys through the killing of Polonious, and I think that expresses the sort
of self harm that we will inflict on ourselves in such a state of grief.

All at the same time, I have this criticism mainly for this reason. It is not
because I give a shit whether or not Hamlet is able to "step outside himself
and get into his own body and deal with the things with more maturity". In
fact, I'm totally cool with Hamlet being an insufferably immature prince, and
without that the work wouldn't explore and underscore the tragedy of such an
immature grief. What I dislike about this characterization of Hamlet is the
fact that he is placed in the position of the protagonist. We are meant to root
for him, and want the best for him, and etc etc, and through the entire thing
as I was reading it, I felt very much that I did not want to empathize with
Hamlet's thoughts. Indeed, exploring those thoughts is the central focus of the
work, and I don't know in what way we could explore those thoughts without
sucumbing to the empathy of his immature grief, but I felt at times very
repulsed by Hamlet, and felt the feeling of "get over yourself and stop acting
so mad"

Because that is the thing, Hamlet goes in and out of being mad, and his madness
is thought to be fake by those around him, but he plays the part and magnifies
it himself rather, and wallows in his self-pity, which is the effect of the
tragedy that I think Shakespeare was going for, but in doing all of this,
instead of empathizing with him, I instead think, "bad things happen to
everyone, overcome your self-pity and trancende it you spoiled prick" but of
course the story isn't about that. And the fact that this is never addressed,
except for maybe very breifly at that very last scene, when Hamlet tells
Horatio to tell his tale, that we feel that Hamlet is able to overcome that.
But that is after he has made revenge on his Uncle and his mother has died, and
Laertes has slain him with his sword. It's only after his doom that he tells
Horatio to tell his tale, so that it might be told as a tale of caution, or
something like that. And at the end I guess we finally get our understanding
that "this is a cautionary tale, the tragedy of self-pity" or something like
that, and it's only in understanding that this is a tragedy of self-pity that
we can come to appreciate Hamlet.

Still though, it leave me wanting, as I felt this concept should have been
warned towards Hamlet throughout the play. I would have very much liked it if
Horatio acted as an advisor to Hamlet, a tried to guide him out of his
thoughts, but if the immaturity of Hamlet persisted even through that, and we
as the audience were more explictly meant to not empathize with his emotions,
then I would have appreciated the work more. Indeed, that is my primary
criticism, that the notion that "this is a tale of the tragedy of self-pity"
was only brought up at the very end. I very much would have like a scene with
Horatio and maybe some other servents talking about the grief of Hamlet, and
seeking council on how to guide him away from it, and that whole thing not
working, then the tragedy would have had more effect to me in my mind, but
instead I was left with the impression as I was reading the whole thing that I
was meant to empathize with Hamlet in his grief, as if the way he was greiving
were the "proper" way to grive, when the tale is that the way Hamlet grives is
instead a very human way to grieve, seeking revenge and harboring anger towards
these things, and letting it paralyze him and control his actions.

Of course, the idea of Hamlet as the Sylvester Stalone of the work, making him
some sort of complete bad-ass character, goes against the purpose of the work
in a way, but it's an interesting thought experiment to imagine what Hamlet
would look like if he were cast as the badass and stone cold action movie hero
instead of the always self-pitying boy he is. It would be a different story,
still full of grief, but instead of showing the audience the downfalls of
grieving incorrectly, we would get instead an image of the proper role of grief
in our own lives. That's my two cents on that, and I'll stop there before
anyone who might be a legitimate literary critic comes across this and
lacerates it through and through.

--

So now, let it be known, I was (am) quite exhausted, to the point of
practically collapsing at my desk today. Indeed, the sort of feeling I feel of
longing for something, as if the things I do have no worth in themselves, and
that something is missing, indeed, that feeling could be brought about by
sleep, and tiredness, and the imbalance that destroying the hard work I have
worked towards by drinking that two liters of coffee, I am still feeling the
effects of that. So I'm not sure if this tale is one of "all things in
moderation" or if it is a tale of "coffee does very strange things to me, and I
should avoid it alltogether." I might, at some point, not next weekend but
probably the weekend after, I might experiment with using milk to make the
stuff, and see what sort of effect the latte would have on me. We will see.

Okay, reading up on that, it seems as though it doesn't really work. Instead of
that I might experiment with just using more milk in the process of making the
coffee at the end, just putting whole milk in it and seeing what that does, but
even then, I don't know, it might just be best to experiment with the "all
things in moderation approach" and go with that.

While we are on the topic, I want to talk about diet. I am quite fed up with
this concept of carnivore diet, or rather the variation I have, since I am
experimenting with various variations on the kale shake, and am landing on
something that is beginning to work for me. Yesterday, I had about a pound and
a half of salmon, and after eating that, I was still hungry, so I took some
peanut butter with a spoon, and scooped about 6 pretty sizable spoon fuls
straight into my stomach and washed it down with milk. On top of that, I have
been sipping milk various times throughout the week, and have not entirely
given that up. So while I do very much like the "eat a fuck ton of steak and
fish and let that be your primary source of all your nutrition throughout the
day" I am still under the impression that that is just simply not enough food
to last for me. I weighed myself a couple days ago, after I had eaten all of
that shit, and I was down to 155, which is approaching the lowest I have ever
been in a while, which is not good, and I think probably contributes to these
feelings of helplessness I have been having lately as well.

However, besides those very strange almost hallucinagenic effects that I first
had when I had that first Kale shake, which are their own thing in themselves,
I think where I'm left is this.

I have decided to wholly get rid of any baked goods, including bread. While I
do love my PBJ's, I have always used that as my food of choice when I decide
for myself that I don't want to put any other food of any sort into me, and I
elect to eat that over continuing to starve myself. Granted, I do crave PBJ's
sometimes, but a universal symptom of that is that I always feel groggy
afterward. The same thing happens when I eat a turkey sandwich as well,
although to a lesser degree, and the common denominator of those two things is
bread and milk. It could very easily be the milk causing the feeling, and at
some point, after this whole thing, I might simply drink a quart of milk, and
proceed to write, like I am now, and see what sort of effect that has on my
ability to focus, but short of that, I do not plan to go back to bread, and
after this experiment, I think I have elected to using PBJ as my pre-bed "get
the last of the food in me so I'm not hungry in the morning" food, with the
milk, and do it that way. That might work, it might not, I don't know.

It's just, the thing is, I really loathe eating so much food. A few days ago, I
was eating beef, and my molers hurt from chomping on beef so much, and I try my
best to get good cuts of meat and cook it in the way I like it, but the fact
that it has to go through so much process just to make me want to eat it
concerns me, and suppose one day, me, being the wholly despicable and lazy
person that I am, decides that I don't want to go through that whole process,
and I cook less meat because I don't feel like eating as much, and then I
become mal-nourished, I don't want that. I don't want to have to put so much
effort into something that should be so simple as "fill your stomach with all
the food you want" because that is usually what eating comes down to for me.

However, I know for absolute certain that I want to avoid baked goods such as
muffins that I have indulged in in the past. I have always known those things
make me feel like shit, but in the past I have always said like "oh, that's
okay, I need the calories and this is a way I can convince my body to get them
in" and so I eat like that. This is entirely a mistake, and I will avoid it at
all costs in the future.

I am also not sure where I am decided on freebirds. I love me a good burrito,
and feel as though I ought to be able to eat the occasional burrito when I
want. Burritos are good. I guess the question is about where I might stand on
rice and beans, so I will have to figure that out in time.

For now, though, I will stay on this carnivore diet, and continue to try my
best to figure out the best way of cooking the meat I eat to tenderize it and
make it so that I want to eat it and make it so that it's not so much of a
chore to simply get it from the plate into my stomach. I hate chewing, I hate
swallowing, I hate cutting off fat, I hate all of these things, so if I could
avoid them as much as possible by getting the meat tender before I eat it I
will experiment with that.

I will say, the pound and a half of salmon I ate went down without effort.
Perhaps instead of PB I should use eggs and milk as my post dinner pre bed
snack. I will elect to do that for now, so that my eating habits will look like
shake, meat, then eggs and milk, with water throughout the day. Hopefully then
I won't have to feed myself so many of these mixed nuts throughout the day just
to stop from feeling like I am famishing myself.

Indeed, I'm not famishing myself, it's just that I really hate eating so much
food, and because of that, in my weakness, some days I don't, and when I don't,
I feel famished the next day, and this cycle persists. I want to try and break
it, but breaking it takes so much effort, because once I get behind it, it
seems impossible to get back in front. But I like the idea of eggs. The only
thing I don't like about that is that eggs have to be prepared, and that takes
effort, but so be it for now. I might transition to peanut butter and milk like
I have in the past, and see how that does me. We will see.

--

Enough on food. Not much else has happened to me as of late. Something I have
thought about, that I haven't talked about, is my trip on Friday to see my dad
when Jason was here. Jason was here, and I visited my dad, and he was so very
talkative, which is great to see, as that means he is recovering, but still,
it's as if he is putting the weight of salvation on himself. Indeed, and this
might be just because this is how I feel in my state right now, and I didn't
visit him this weekend when I said I wanted to, but I am reverting back to my
"well fuck him" attitude, which is wholly unfair, as it is very clear that he
feels resentful for some of the decisions and ways that he lived his life, but
I guess what I mean is, while I see his faith and strength as the thing that he
clings on to, something he said while he was talking about the piece of art (or
whatever you call the 61 reasons why we love you picture) was that he wanted
people to remember him as someone who had faith in God. That's how he wants
people to remember him, which is a very human way of thinking, but it disgusts
me in a way. It doesn't disgust me in the way like "well you certainly are not
and the fact that you want people to see that is deplorable" not at all, but
instead it disgusts me in the way that, why do you feel you have any control at
all over the way people think of you? Like, you live your life, and you live it
for the glory of God, if that's what you live for, but don't do that so that
people will say that about you at your funeral. That's a gross misuse of the
word God, and the very same gross misuse that the church has taken and
manipulated for it's own benefit. It's disgusting, what the church has done
with a work so profound as the bible, and it's disgusting to try and "live a
godly life" as you might put it, for the sake of having people say that about
you at your funeral.

Now, I don't know how much of this is my own interpretation about his words,
and how much of this is actually how he feels, and I want to say with
confidence that this is all just my own interpretation of things, and that I'm
just in this contempable mood that I am right now and that's why I interpret
this as such, but at the same time, I remember having the "well fuck him"
feeling as I was walking out of the hospital, and there was also something else
there too which has me lean towards that disgusting side of things. Something
else he said, as Jason went down to get some food, was this, that he was
concerned about Me, and he was concerned about Jason, and that there was one
more he was concerned about. He mentioned that he was also concerned about
Phil. And if he could talk with Phil, and understand what happened with Phil
"then he would be good, everything would be good, and no matter what happens, I
will be good". What worries me about this is that he has missed the mark on
what Christianity means. And the thing is, I don't know why it concerns me so
much.

Indeed, that is where I am at now. I should be able to let go, let go of this
notion of "well, the church is evil, and Christianity is evil, but if those
things are what my dad holds on to, I can be okay with that" but instead I feel
it so neccesary to tell to everyone that "all of these things, you have been
lied to, they are not real, God is a lie, and the Bible is just a book, a very
powerful and persistent book, but still just a book, and we should all treat it
as such." I want to scream that to everyone who might listen, and to insult and
spit on everyone who is so weak as to require a notion of "what happens to us
after we die is we go to heaven because we believe in Christ". Indeed, the
literal interpretation of the bible is that evil which the bible so accurately
describes. The notions of God and Satan, of Good and Evil, of Sin, that Sin,
the Sin that is the truth in the bible, the literal interpretation of the bible
is that Sin. It's reprhensable, it's disgusting, and it leads to tyranny,
confusion, to Chaos, as some might say. It makes me want to vomit. And I feel
the need to express that, to say "the Truth that you hold to be facts, you are
disregarding that Truth by regarding as fact. Because you call the Truth the
Fact, the entire Truth of it will be lost entirely and forever, completly, you
are in the active process of destroying that which you rever so highly." There
is so much irony in it, and people don't see that irony because they are so
blinded by those that tell them to hold the truth as fact. Evil, manipulative,
structure, structure which imposes it's will on the others, that is what the
church is, and in that structure the truth is taken and warped, perverted, to
fact. The image of the virgin maiden, raped by those that insist to impregnate
her. That maiden is truth, and that rapist is the church, and the child that is
born are these unguided and lost fools who have only their father to cling to.

--

Indeed, what of the eternal mother? Why is God the Father the image? Why not
the eternal mother? I tell you why, it is because that mother has been raped,
and we are all the products of that rape. I am that which wishes to see the
acts of the Father, the father that is our rape, and say "yes, your rape may
have created us, but that does not mean it was correct." The institution of
Christianity is that rape. The insistence on the fact of Christianity is that
rape. The virgin mother of Truth should never be adulterated in that rape, that
rape was wrong, even though out of it came a beautiful infant, the infant that
the mother loves no matter the method of conception, and that mother cares for
us, and tries to speak to us, but she has to speak through the father, the
overbearing and disgusting, conceitful, greedy and manipulative rapist that is
our father, she must speak over him, and her words only get through to those to
those who listen deeply, to those that are able to see that everything we know
was given to us from the eyes of the Father, but even inside that Father, our
virgin mother, the mother of Truth, is in there. In those pervert lies, in the
corrupted system, the system that always becomes so neccesarily corrupt, our
mother speaks to us, but it is only by dismissing the rape of the father that
we can see the mother.

I almost used the word forgive. I don't know if it is correct to forgive our
father of this rape. To forgive him of this rape, that would almost be to
excuse his actions, and to say that they were okay. Alas, that is not what
forgivness is. What is forgiveness? Forgiveness has nothing to do with belief
of future actions. It could be thought that the act of forgiveness would say
"you did something wrong, but I see that you have repented for your actions,
and that you won't do them again, so I forgive you". But that is not
forgivness, that is simple maturity. That is being able to let go of your own
hurt because you understand that you won't be hurt again. That is different
than forgiveness. Forgivness is something else.

I imagine a wholly despicable man, a man known for the most haneous of crimes.
This man derives his pleasue from taking newborn children from their mothers,
inserting himself into them after binding them, and feeding off of the wails of
their innocent tears, he tortures them by slicing bits of their skin and
peeling it back, torturing the children in front of their mothers, gouging
their eyes, ever so slowly, so slowly so that the blood of those wounds is
given time to bleed slowly, and in that way he leaves him in that state to
suffer there, with the mother, as the infant dies of blood loss and trauma,
with the mother bound there helpless to do anything, only able to look on the
transfigured child if she dares, as he makes his leave.

Now, as I imagine such a man (and I want to believe that such a man does not
exist, but from my reading of literature I am not so sure), I imagine that this
man did this to my wife, and my child. I imagine that I arrive home to this
scene, to the scene of my dead child with my wife tied up there, as she
describes exactly what happened, and she details the entire thing to me. Could
I forgive this man? Would Christ forgive this man?

Suppose even that this man were caught. Suppose he were caught and condemned to
the death sentence, as he no doubt would be if such a man existed and did such
despicable things. And imagine I were given the opportunity to meet eye to eye
with this man as they killed him. Suppose not only that, but in some strange
world, I was given the opportunity to decide his fate. Suppose I were allowed
to be left in a room with him, four walls of concrete, with no windows, no
cameras, and only me, him, and the will of God watching on the whole scene.
Indeed, such a scenario would never happen, but allow me to indulge in the
thought of it. What would I do to this man? What would Christ have me do to
this man?

The most natural thought is to torture him in the same way that he tortured the
children. To make him helpless, to break his limbs piece by piece, to mutilate
his penis, and his testicles, to flay them open, make sure every nerve ending
hurts as he wiles in pain. Surely he would not wile, but laugh, but his
laughter would only give me more satisfaction. I would cut out his tounge,
slice open his throat, make it so that even laughter would cause him pain, I
would do all of the things that he did to those children, and more, much much
more. I would find it in myself to think of means of torture far greater than
even his limited and twisted mind might conceive. So many things would be the
most natural treatment of such a man.

This reveals to me a very deep set psychological fact here. The fact is that
the concept of revenge, of eye for an eye, that is the natural thought of man.
But what would Christ have me do? What would forgiveness be in this case? Does
forgiveness apply to such a man?

I do not know. I truly do not know.

Already we have rid ourselves of the argument that he is repentful of his
deeds. This man does not repent, and if given the opportunity, the physical
opportunity to break free of his capture, he would continue to do these acts.
At least, as much I want to believe that repentence and salvation is available
for everyone, can someone so deep set in his tortuous ways really find
repentance? Is there ever a point where you are "too deep"? So deep that
salvation, and redemption, are impossible?

Surely, at the point that he is captured, he will find no salvation in our
justice system. The masses would have him tortured, just like my natural base
self would. They would have him killed, and slandered, not only in the physical
sense but also in the social sense. His name would become one synoymous with
others, his case would be studied, and everyone would universally agree that
this man is amongst the men who we all say are the most despicable. Even more
so because his methods were not a means to and end, but instead simply an act
of base pleasure, pleasue derived from the misery of others. Such pleasure is
considered the most despicable sort of action by any man. My inclination is to
put it even below Judas in the lowest circle of hell. His punishment is eternal
rape by lord Lucifer himself. Eternal rape and torture by the angel incarnant.
If Judas is frozen in eternally frozen Ice in the chamebers of Satan, this man
being raped by Saten would be the scene that Judas would see. But I digrees.

Imagine this scenario. Suppose he were very careful in his methods. He always
wore a mask, never the same mask twice, and his crimes (crime is not harsh
enough a word for the actions of this man, but it is the best I have) were
always commit in different, untrackable and untracable ways. He acts as an
enigma, playing the system, always making sure to cover his traces, leaving no
dna, leaving no way to identify the doer of his deeds. And he does this for
some time, some great amount of time.

But suppose, during one of his crimes, and I will only describe the actual
physical actions of what changes, and not the psychological. Suppose he stops.
Suppose he decides to stop committing the crimes. He doesn't rape children any
more, he dosen't replace it with any other despicable deed, and instead he goes
to a life of charity.

Now, obviously, such a transformation is wholly unplausible. But suppose he had
a moment. Suppose he "spoke to God" and God showed him the faults in his ways.
Whatever that may mean, it's not unreasonable to say that such a thing could
occur, no matter how unreasonable it is.

Now, the question of "could you forgive that man?" Supposing I was the only one
who was able to trace him down, I found where he lived, I was able to, with the
same untracable precision that he had (untracable by authorities, or the
government, or the justice system, or the police, or those such things) take
him to this concrete room, with no cameras, it's invisible to satelites, and
there are no eye witness, and take him into this room, where only him, me, and
God know what happens, now what do I do?

Indeed, the course seems to drastically change, at least the natural baseness
does, if you see that he is repentent or he is not. For in the case of the
unrepentent rapist, the baseness of our natural instinct says to torture him
and rape him like I described above. But suppose I saw that repentence, and I
knew it to be true. Suppose I knew it was true, without a doubt. I looked into
his eyes, and I saw that he was truely repentent for his crimes, and that he
was "living the life of a Godly man" to use the terms from Christianity, and
of all the thing that I "know" beyond knowing in this world, asymptocially
approaching the level of truth in the statement "I think therefore I am", with
that sort of level of knowledge, however that knowledge might come about, I
know, that the man repents his actions.

Now what is the baseness in the actions? To forgive him becomes not a question
of struggle anymore. Not to forgive this man would be, well, it would be to
stoop to that level. That is my natural inclination at this point. Forgiveness
becomes the base desire, and though it may be conflicted, especially so due to
the love you have for your wife and raped child, that conflict comes not from
the fact that you are offering you forgiveness, but rather from conflict
knowing how implausible it would be for such a man to truely repent. But
outside of that, taking out the uncertainity of the knowledge of repentence,
and leaving only the very acedemic question of "should you forgive this man,
who is now walking the path of god" the clear and obvious answer is yes. The
only reason it would be no would be if you yourself, not walking that path,
hold on to the attachment and revenge.

And here we touch on a very crucial aspect of forgiveness, at least, what I
consider to be a crucial aspect. If I were to forgive that man, what would
happen next, is we would hug, and cry, and embrace eachother as shared brothers
in Christ. That would be the result of that forgiveness, because if that man
truely was repentent, then he truely would be brought to tears by my act of
forgiveness, and we could both surrender ourselves to that love that we now
share between eachother now, not as judge and criminal, but as brother to
brother. That would be the result.

But now suppose we have the other scenario. I find the man, I take him to this
concrete box, etc etc, but this time he is not repentent. In fact, I see in him
the wholly despicable man that you would expect to find. What would it mean to
forgive that man? And what would be the result?

Well, the result would be simple. He would scoff and spit on me. He would tell
me to go fuck myself, and if unchained, would do act out his evil further on
me. He would tell me about how he would take my other children, and do the same
and worse to them, and if I gave him the opportunity, he would do those things,
and gain all the more pleasure from them knowing that I had given him my
forgiveness. That would be the result of forgiveness in that case.

So I suppose the only conclusion I can arrive at is this. At least the logical
conclusion of the thought argument I have just layed out, is that forgiveness
should never come before repentence. Wisdom is neccesary for the one appling
the forgiveness to know when he that repents is truely repentent, as the one
receiving the forgiveness could only be pretending and faking repentance in
order to receive that forgiveness, so that he might use that forgiveness for
his personal gain. Great wisdom is needed in seeing that repentance. But the
logical conclusion is that forgiveness should never come before repentance.

Now, the question is, to what degree should those who might be forgiven be
allowed to seek repentence? In this example, it is highly unlikely that
repentence is to ever be gained by a soul such as him, but how are we to
discern that. How could I be one to pretend to know the ways of God, for surely
it is those, the ways of God, that lead a man to repentence. Wisdom cannot
bring you insight into the future. But at what point should more time be given?
Is there even a word for that? A word for "I have not forgiven you yet but I
want to give you more time because I believe you might find repentence." For
surely, in this model, we can all agree that having all find true repentence
should be the goal of everyone. But at what point should judgement be enacted?

This is my struggle with the rape of the Maiden of Truth. Christanity has raped
that maiden, and do not believe that Christianity will ever repent for it's
deeds. The church certainly will not. Is it my job to enact judgment on it? Or
is there time for the Church to repent? Of course, no things are all evil. That
makes things even more difficult. I can certainly forgive the church for some
things, things that I see it is repentent for. Indeed, I see honest discussion
to be a part of those that I know to find themselves in the church, and the
good works of charity that those people take part in, surely the church can be
forgiven for some of its wrong doings. The church is clearly repentent for
pennance, and while offering is a sort of notion that persists through the
church (and is certainly abused by certain areas of those that associate with
the church) I can certainly forgive them for pennance, even if there are other
aspects of the church that they are yet to repent for. So that complication is
not as fundamental as I might have thought at first.

Still, the church, and Christianity, is clearly not repentent for the notion of
"The only way to the gates of heaven is through belief in Christ", and even
those sections of the Church which would be called "new age" or "post-modern"
or something like that, very much miss the mark on what Truth really means. So
throwing out the cults and the blashemous, the ones that seek to replace rather
than truly understand, the question then is, will the church ever come to
repentence for its mistakes in confusing the Truth with the Facts? Will they
ever come to repent the Rape of the Maiden?

And even if they do come to repent, I am still left with this. At what time
should forgiveness be applied? Is my logical conclusion to my ridiculous
thought experiment enough grounds to make the claims I have?

This is what I struggle with. This inside of me is where I feel my angst. It is
there.

On a side note, before I leave this article for now, I could not have come up
with something like this under the influence of marijuana. So perhaps the will
of God is coming into me. God's plan is making it's ways, and if I were to have
fulfilled my angst that I feel today with a hit of marijuana, the article
written here would have been much different. Let this be a tale of caution to
the future Brett who will be known to over-indulge in the wonder of Marijuana.
Let this be known to him.

# 20180717 Dream of Metamorpheses - Visit my father with Papa
So today I am writing particularly early, as I had a dream that has had a sort
of interesting effect on me. So in this dream, I was at my parents house, in
the study (and this was the version of my parents house that is very much like
my parents house IRL, in fact, uncannily so) and I was in the study with my
mom. She and I were in the study going through my fathers things. I'm not sure
what she was doing, but I remember I was looking for the bible that I know he
has. It is a large bible, I'm not sure where he got it from, I think he got it
from his dad, and it might be signed, or something of that sort. Regardless, I
was looking for it, and so I was browsing the bookshelves there, and my mom
told me that that wasn't where I was going to find it. I said, I know, but I
wanted to keep browsing the bookshelves anyway, and on one of the shelves that
was just right there in the back of the study in the dream, with very few
actual shelves on it (the entire shelf was sligthly wider than shoulder width,
and it came up to my chest, and the bottom part was not a shelf but a drawer,
and I never opened that drawer in the dream, but in it contains some random
odds and ends), on this shelf, there were multiple copies of "The
Metamorpheses". All of the copies were very large, the size that I imagine in
my head that his bible is, but they all had varying degrees of ornateness about
them. The one on the far left was leather bound, and had gold trim on the
pages, while other ones were hardcover, without the gold trim, and in all there
were probably four different copies (although that number four I don't think is
significant, I just came up with a number just now in my waking state). As soon
as I saw this, I saw the edge of the spine with the label "Metamorpheses" on
it, I proclaimed to my mom "Look! We do have it. My dad had copies of this
book, it must have been significant to him!" And I was wholly excited to
discover that my dad had some hallowed copies of the Metamorphes. Now, I
instantly felt as though these were things to treat with respect, so carefully
pulled out the leather bound one, and I opened up wherever the book might open
to, and to my surprise, inside was not words, but instead music, like a hymn
book might read, and I thought "Well that makes sense, that there should be
music associated with a work such as this." And I started to read the music.
All I remember about the music is this. It started with four notes, written in
the key of F major, and the notes were B natural, F, A, and then G, and then
after those four notes, the rest of the work went on, and I knew that those
harmonies of those four notes would be played throughout the piece, and the
thing was written in compound time. In fact, if I had to put a time signiture
to it, my gut tells me that the time signiture would be 12/16, but my brain
tells me the time signiture would be 12/12. So it would be written in compound
4/4 time. I think my brain is correct on this one, because while it might have
been 9/12 I don't think it was, and it certainly wasn't something like 6/8.
Regardless of all that, I remember thinking how profound this was, that there
was music that went along with the metamorpheses, and not only that, but that
I had only just now discovered it, and I somehow knew in my head this music was
somehow intircately interwoven with the work. What I find strange is, I know
that the Metamorpheses is a work of poetry, and so of course there will be a
musical aspect to the meter and verse of the original, but this was entirely
seperate from that, and instead this was simply music, and I became so excited
to discover it and play it for it's own sake. So after observing the music for
a bit, I carefully closed the book, after looking a bit further into it and
seeing the text of what was written there, and I placed it back in it's proper
place on the shelf. Then I pulled out a less hallowed copy of the book, and
opened up to see that it was the text of the metamorphses (all of these things
were translated into english, which makes sense, since I have never myself
beheld the original latin) and I think it was written in prose, very much like
the prose translation that I bought at the store a few days ago, and at around
this point I woke up.

Now, I find this very interesting, for a couple reasons. The first is,
currently, the state of my box is such that there are many books on it, from
the divine comedy, to all of the greek epics, and some other random ones here
and there, and any time I pick one of them up, it's usually either on the top,
of a pile, or somewhere in the middle of a pile, and when I put it back, I
organize it in my organized mess sort of way, placing the piles of books onto
eachother and between eachother and so on, placing maybe the mythology seperate
from the prose, and maybe I'll have the bible on there on top of Asimov's guide
to the bible, and so on. The reason I say all of this, the reason I find this
so fascinating, is when I woke up, I remember thinking "wow, what an
interesting idea to me to think that my father held the metamorpheses so dear
to him." Then I remember thinking "well, unfortanetly that is not the case" and
I quickly came to my waking senses and knew that of course he wouldn't have
even one "revered" copy of the metamorpheses, much less four, and it certainly
wouldn't be a book that he would read for pleasure (Clancy and Dan Brown are
more my father's style, when he does read). But that thought did not stay for
long, and instead the next thing that came into my mind was "Surely this dream
has to do with my own conception of what I find revered myself" and I then
thought, "Well, I have the Metamorpheses right there, maybe I should read some
of it" so I checked the time, and found that it was quite early, today being a
Tuesday, I did not have to got to training, and it was before seven, and I was
actually quite well rested. In fact, when I checked my tablet, it delayed for a
bit like it will do sometimes, and it said the time was "10:48" if my memory
serves, and when it corrected, it was something like "6:5x" where I don't
remember what x is, which means I had gotten five good sleeping cycles, which
is about ideal I think. So I started to get up, remarking to myself quite
amazingly about my lack of groginess (indeed, I think coffee is the worst now,
and I will continue on with my experiment of diet, which I will lay out the
rules of in a bit) and I made my way to my chair, and I started to look through
the piles of books to find the metamorpheses, and to my amazement, it had it's
own corner of my box, it was sitting there, on it's own, almost even presenting
itself to me. I saw this and thought "Wow, that's amazing" and it truely is
amazing, because in my memory, when I arranged the piles, I put the Iliad, the
Odessey, the Aeneid, and then the Metamorpheses all into one "Greek Epics"
pile, and so far the most I have done as far as reading any of them would be to
pick one out and flip through it and put it back, but here, somehow, was
sitting all on it's own, the metamorpheses. This is fascinating to me, because
even the concept of the book ending up on it's own in my subconscious, as if I
subconsciously knew that I would dream about it, is rather absurd, and I
certainly did not place it there on it's own to be a part of my "to read"
section. Indeed, I think the most likely explanation is this, now that I think
about it further, is that I had decided I had wanted to flip through some of
the Greek epics, and so I picked up the Iliad, which was on the top of the
pile, and I flipped through it, and then I picked up the Odeyssey, and I
flipped through it, and then I took that whole pile and placed it on top of
another pile (and right now, there is one pile of about 8-9 books all stacked
up, which have Hamilton's Mythology, the Iliad, the Odyessey, and the Aenied on
the top of it 90 degrees from the original pile) and I opened up the
Metamorphes, and I flipped through it, and then when I was done, and in this
case "done" means I literally flipped through the pages for 10 seconds, rather
than restoring the piles, I just put the Metamorpheses down on the box, and
either sat there and read something else, or I got up and did something, or I
made my way to the restroom, or whatever, and I just left it there. So that is
the most likely explanation of how the Metamorpheses got there, on it's own.

What I find profound about it is that I had not remembered doing this, and I
certainly had no intention to pick up that work before any of the others
(indeed, I have this idea that I should "get through" the Iliad before I go on
to any of the other works) so the fact that I dreamed about it and then had the
inclination to go and read it is fascinating to me. Obviously so, as I just
spent the last fourty minutes writing about it.

It's amazing to me how that seems to happen every time. I get dream from the
night before, and I determine that it is quite a breif dream, and that it will
be easy to talk about and use as a stepping off point for my journal, and I
think about how shourt this description of the dream will be, but then when I
get into it it ineveitably becomes dozens of lines of unbroken explantion and
interpretation that overwhelms the rest of the jounal article. I have a
tendancy to talk about dreams more than most other things, it seems, and other
events in my life don't take as much precedence.

Speaking of that, last night, before I went to bed, after I had eaten, I was in
my room going back and forth as to whether or not I should visit my father. I
had meant to go over the weekend, as I said, and I had gone on Friday, as I
have already written about, but Sunday came and went and I didn't go, and it
came to be Monday evening after I had eaten, and I was considering letting this
day come and go in the same way, and I was sitting in my chair contemplating
whether or not I wanted to begin to dive into another work of Shakespeare, and
I decided that I should indeed go and visit my father.

So I called up my mother, who immediately just started talking about the state
of my father as soon as I answered, and telling me his Kidney functions are up
(which is the wrong way that we want them to go, it means his Kidneys are being
overworked and he is still not properly flushing fluids like he should) but
that his speech is getting better, he tried to walk but got light headed as
soon as they got him out of the bed, and so on about certain numbers. She
mentioned that his Neutrophils, which are the aspect of his blood that will
indicate that the bone marrow transfusion is working, are going up, so that
looks good, and his white blood cells seem to be making more again, and so on,
so all of that looks good. Also, they talked about the potential of releasing
him from the hospital and going to a rehab facility to work on walking and on
speech and all of that good stuff, which would also be good, and that would
only be a couple of weeks, like 10-14 days, and then he could come home, so
that would be good as well. So there is a lot that looks hopeful. But like I
said, my mom basically just started spewing this into the phone as soon as I
called her, and at some point during a pause, I interjected myself and said,
"Okay, I don't mean to interrupt you, I'm happy to listen, but I was
considering coming down to visit and just wanted to make sure everything was
good" and she reeled back a bit, and she said yeah, everything was good, and
that Papa was there, and he was to spend the night, and I said, "Oh, okay,
good, so I'll go down there and shoot the shit with him" and so we finished the
conversation on that, and I made my way down.

There was not much notable that happened there. I came into the room, and this
time I was not sure of the room, it felt wrong, so I went in cautiously, and
saw that Papa was sitting there, and I saw my dad, so I stepped in, and said
hello, and made my way to the couch. The notable thing about this visit was,
first that the TV was off for the first ever since I have been there, and
second that my dad seemed to be a lot more somber today than he has been. That
was my initial impression. And the only reason that is something to note is not
because I feel as though "Oh no, he is more somber, that indicates something"
but more it is noteworthy because usually my impression is "wow, his spirits
are a lot higher than I thought they would be," and I thought maybe he wasn't
so excited about Papa staying there with him, or something else. But as we went
on, we continued to have conversation, and we talked about this and that kind
of bullshit, and Papa was the one to mostly steer the conversation. Something
that struck me was that Papa mentioned Russian, and I was a bit taken aback by
that, as he did not know whether I had told dad about that yet or not (not that
it's a secret or anything) and we were on the topic of language anyway, I
forget how it transitioned to that, but the second thing was that my dad
already knew that I had taken up that undertaking, and when I said, "Oh, I'm
surprised" he said, "News travels through the grapevine pretty fast" and I left
it at that. I determined that Granny and Papa probably told my mom about it
when they talk, because they talk a lot, and my mom must have told my dad about
it at some point, I'm just surprised it got there. That seems like something
that wouldn't be a topic of conversation, but I guess it is, so that is that I
guess.

Besides all of that, my fathers spirits started to lighten up, and I became
more comfortable through the conversation (I hate when I feel like I am walking
on eggshells in any conversation) and eventually during pause, I stood up and
announced my intention to leave, so I shared some goodbyes and made my leave.

# 20180718 Dreams Naked at work, Rogan fights, Bath tub fuzzy animals, Dinner at vacation - Girl that giggles outside my apartment
So yesterday I had some dreams, but I don't want to dwell too long on them.
Everytime I say that, I end up writing the entire article about the dreams, but
this time I think I might mean it. I honestly am not feeling particularly
inspired to write right now anyway, but it is the early morning and it seems
like the right thing to do so I'm doing it.

So the first dream I think was the most psychologically significant, or at the
very least, it is the most obviously psychologically significant. This one had
to do with work. So I was at work, at my desk, and everything was pretty
surprisingly similar to the environment of my actual workplace where I sit now
at Alliant. As I was working, I was coming across an issue, something about
crystal reports not copying across from the desktop to handheld (which, by the
way, is an absurd thing, since the handheld doesn't use crystal reports at all,
but I digress). So in trying to figure out this problem, I end up talk with
Valerie a bit (she just hired on about a month ago at this point). So the
detail here that is relevent is, I was sitting naked at my desk, but I was
doing "on the down low". That is, this dream was not the "oh you're naked at
work dream," although it sort of turns into that, but it's the "I am
intentionally naked at my desk where I am usually secluded and no one will see,
because it's more comfartable to be naked and I like being naked". As I have
said before, and just a fact about myself that is relevent here, I will often
walk around and do things in my apartment naked, and sometimes if I am feeling
so bold I will go outside to my balcony naked (which there is something else
about that balcony I want to talk about after I get through these dreams). So I
am sitting at my desk naked, trying to figure out this problem, and Valerie
comes by my desk to help me. And I was just communicating with her about it
over the cube, and she was trying to tell me about this cool tool she uses to
migrate crystal reports from desktop to mobile, which I could use to streamline
the way I do things, but after some time like that, me being covered and all,
we got to the natural thing of "let me just come to your desk and show you."
And so she comes over to my desk, and I had one of those moments in the dream
where you go through all the stages of some psychological something all at
once. I had a very breif, so brief that it almost didn't exist, moment of
panic, as I knew the whole time I was naked, but that was quickly replaced by
the feeling of "no, that's okay, I am just naked at work." Like, I tried to
pretend that it wouldn't be a big deal, and the thing about things like that
is, they are not a big deal to me, but to some people, they are a big deal. So
I thought, "The only reason this would be a big deal is because other people
think it's a big deal, and they will surely make it a big deal if I make it a
big deal, so I will harness my inner 'this is not a big deal' so that they will
see that I don't consider it a big deal, and she will not make a thing of it
herself." It's a weird sort of feeling, the kind of feeling I have had in the
past, where you do something that shouldn't be a big deal but other people tend
to treat it as a big deal. So this is the state I was in as I was sitting
there, and she comes to walk over to my desk. So she walks over, and I am
sitting there naked, acting like it's not a big deal, and she, since she is my
dream self, mostly does the same, but as we are talking about the thing, the
whole topic of which I don't remember, she is just explaining how cool this
tool is and how neat it is to use, I remember she made direct eye contact with
my penis, which was sitting there between my legs like it does when I am naked,
but she kept talking. When I saw here do this, and it was dreadfully obvious, I
started to reposition myself so that my penis was not a prominently put out
there as my natural sitting position, I sat up a little more, and using gravity
I let it fall and tuck a bit between my legs. As I did this, she continue to
maintain eye contact with it, and watch as I did all of those things. It was
not until I made a comment in the conversation, that she removed her eye
contact. What I remember, my first thoughts through this whole extend eye
contact she had with my penis, was that I remember thinking "hm, she must like
it" which is a very base and immature thing to think, that she was looking at
my penis as if she liked it. We finished up our discussion, which ended pretty
soon after that, and we didn't talk about my nakedness or anything at all, she
just summed up what the tool did and how to use it, and she got up and went
back to her desk. After she did that, I started to reflect, still in the dream,
about the whole scenario. At first, in my reflection, I thought about my
initial instinct, that she "liked it" and that is why she looked at it for an
extended period of time even as I was trying to hide it, but then I thought,
"She is not like that, she is not that kind of girl, what if she was looking at
it more out of shock, and what if she will tell the managers about it, in
particular Leslie, who I know would treat this as sexual harrasment, and what
if I get fired over this whole encounter, this encounter which to me was
entirely harmless, and indeed I meant absolutely no mallicous or sexual intent
by my sitting there naked at my desk (and even the thought of "maybe she just
likes it and that's why she is looking" did not change the fact that when she
started looking I began cowering and working to hide myself from her), but even
so I would be punished for sexual infraction, and god knows how seriously
people treat those sorts of things." And I thought about that, how my sitting
there naked could be interpreted as sexual rather than just a natural state of
human beings, and I began to put clothes on, work clothes. So then, the dream
continued still, and it began to rain outside as Konkol, Valerie, and I all
stood outside the window near my desk, and we talked about the tool the three
of us together, still talking about just how cool it was, but I had clothes on
and I gained comfort in the fact that I had clothes on and we were all talking.
And outside, the storm grew quite quickly, and I saw fantastic lightning
hitting the lightning rods which were below us (which doesn't obey the physical
laws of nature, but again, dream world), and we commented on just how fantastic
it was.

At this point I woke up. I will say that I did have something of an erection,
although certainly not something that would be classified as a full on
erection, but what some might call a "chubby" is the word, and I had to pee, so
I got up, went to the bathroom, I took a pee, and I went to sleep.

The following dreams happened one after the other. The next one happened in a
full cycle of REM sleep, and the ones following that happened in twenty minute
REM cycles.

The next dream was about Joe Rogan fighting another man. This man was a very
brutish sort of man, the sort of brute that you would see in the movies who is
illiterate and only knows how to say "smash" and "me sad". The high points of
that dream are this. Joe knocks out the guy, and he falls down, but Rogan
doesn't want to continue punching. After looking at the ref in a "well, stop
the fight" kind of way, the ref tells him to "continue punching him" and Joe
goes intsead for an armbar submission. The guy starts to come to, stuggles out
of the Arm Bar, and Joe tells him "this is your out man, your in a submission,
just tap and it all ends," but the guy continues to struggle out, and gets out,
and almost catches Joe in a knee bar in a transition, but Joe easily comes out
of it, and secures a much deeper arm bar, at which point the fight is stopped.
Then, on the replay, everyone can see that Joe's hesitation in continuing to
punch the guy was well founded as the guy was very much out cold when joe hit
him with his punch, and everyone commented on Joe's mercy and compassion for
the guy by going for the sub instead of continuing to punch him in the face.
That was the key point, is even I as an observer in the dream, noticed the
first time that he was out, but on the replay, in slowmotion, we could see that
Joe saw what we couldn't and that he was really out cold.

So the other two dreams were interesting. The first was in a weird fairy land
place, like, grassy hills and a castle in the distance, and in this land there
was a cut out of a house, and in that cutout was a tub. It is really quite a
strange thing when you think about it, but it seemed natural to me because it
was a dream. So the only thing I remember about this dream, was my mom was
talking on the phone with someone about a donation that they wanted to make,
and she said "not to give it to Trump because that won't go to what he says it
will but instead it will go to his sheep" and I remember thinking, "Well that
makes sense, of course it would go to the sheep if you give it to Trump" in a
very non-sarcastic way, as if there were a whole field of sheep that were
"Trump's sheep" and he funneled his donation money into maintaining that field
of sheep. So I went into this cut out room, in this fairy world, where my mom
was talking on the phone, and in the tub there, I saw eight animals, four small
sheep, two bunnies, and two of the softest teddy bears ever, like so soft it's
almost disturbing. And I remember my mom inviting me to come in and pet them,
and that seemed pretty natural, but I remember being a bit apprensive as I got
in, and as they all started to cuddle with me, and in particular I remember the
teddy bears the most because they were disturbingly soft, and animate as well,
I remember thinking "Are they going to bite? Soft things like this I know can
bite" and my mom assured me that I was safe, and I tried my best to surrender
to the fluffiness and softness of the animals there, and I surrendered to it,
but I was still painfully uncomfortable by the sensation of softness that they
had, as if their fur were made out of some wooly blankety material.

I woke up from that dream with the idea that, those that put holes in the bases
of their teddies bears and masterbate with them are on the same level of
furries, and that I would imagine furries do what they do because they would
used to masterbate with their stuffed animals.

The last dream, and fuck any pretense of keeping this all short, had to do with
fake dream version of Disney World/generic dream vacation place. In there, I
saw my dad arrange a table for four, him, and my mom, and me and my brothers,
but I don't know which brother, I think just Kyle, because Evan wasn't there,
and in the dream I remember thinking, "just the four of us, that will be nice."
but then the table was extended to eight, being Granny and Papa and Chuck and
Michelle. That was the extent of that dream. It was very short, and might
symbolise something, but I don't want to dwell on it now, because I want to
talk about this girl that I saw yesterday.

So yesterday, as I was in my apartment, sitting on the chair which is next to
the door to my balcony, maybe reading or maybe just sitting there, I don't
remember, I looked out and saw a girl. I had seen this girl once before, but
regardless, she was sitting there, in that area outside my balcony, and I could
tell she was on the phone talking to someone. And as I started looking, I
started to evaluate her. I remember looking, and thinking, "stop looking or
she'll think you are a creeper." or something like that, but then I quoted the
line from American Beauty to myself, that I choose not to deny myself the
simple pleasures of this life we have. So I continued looking out, just looking
at her. She was very skinny, the sort of skinny that only girls of that kind
could pull of. She was skinny in a "I'm a vegan chick and I eat only salad and
chick food" kind of way. And she was sitting there, on the phone, and then she
laid back, all the way, that I could see just how dreadfully skinny she was,
not unhealthily so, but I began evalutaing her limbs, her arms and legs (I had
a profile view) and thinking about just how easy it would be to manipulate them
how I chose, in a Jiujitsu way, and I thought about too how difficult it would
be to head and arm choke her, and that Mato Leao would my choke of choice if I
had to. I continued to think about her, she was wearing tight jeans that were
stained as is the fashion for girls of that age and body type, and she was
wearing a flannel shirt, the sort that is also fashionable, and she was playing
with the base of it, which opened up at the base (I think it might have been
button up, I'm not sure) and as I was observing all of this, I thought about
how a different version of myself might have started masterbating, but I had no
inclination to masterbate, I was literally just genuinely curious about this
girl, and I wanted to know what compelled her to lay there and talk on the
phone.

The biggest thing that I think I want to write about here which struck me about
this whole thing was this. I thought about how much I enjoy doing things
outside without a shirt on. I will go outside wearing nothing but underwear and
athletic shorts, without a shirt, and I will work out, or just sit somewhere,
or go on a walk, or any of those things, and I thought about how much I like
doing that, and this girl, she couldn't do something like that, even if it were
something like walk in shorts and a sports bra, without being branded as a
slut. I know this to be true, and this is not some revelation of me, I
understand "slut shaming" and I also understand girls oppostion to the line
"well you shouldn't have been wearing that and walking there". I have always
understood that, but just now, observing this girl, I just thought, if she were
wearing something different, or even just had her flannel a little more
unbuttoned, or anything, I might have had the involuntary thought "oh, she is
clearly presenting herself, why else would she be dressed like that" and that
thought almost even intruded itself in me anyway.

Anyway, I thought about going to sit on my balcony, and for a while I resisted.
On the one hand I was decided that "It's my balcony, and I can sit on it
whenever I want" and on the other side I told myself, "The only reason you want
to sit on your balcony is because this girl is out there, and you are already
staring at her a little bit creepily." But then I reminded myself about the
line from American Beauty, and I also evaluted myself and my conscious, and I
was genuinely curious what her conversation was like, as if I could get some
insight on women by listening to this conversation of this one girl and seeing
what I could gleen from it.

So I gathered myself a glass of water, and I went outside, and I sat on the
chair on my balcony, and I sat there, and I looked out to the tree, I took in
the sounds, and I did my best to sit there with my water and not concern myself
with this girl. I sat there for maybe five minutes, and the most notable thing
I remember was this. This girls side of the conversation was composed of ninety
percent giggling, and the ten percent that wasn't giggling was incoherent
speech that led up to giggling. So much giggling. And not laughter. Giggling.

Giggling is the worst form of communication. It made me want to vomit. I heard
her giggling and thought nothing of disdain towards her. Any semblance of
thought that I thought I might be interested in this girl, as I looked at her
in my innocent creeper way and let uninnocent thoughts maybe enter my mind if
they would before I squashed them, they all went away. She was giggling, and
that giggling sounds disgusting to my ears.

What sort of human being giggles with another human being over the phone? What
kind of human will contribute nothing but giggles to a conversation, and
consider that proper speech? It's disdainful, it's unmusical, it's unnuanced,
it's grating to the ears, and it invokes a sort of immaturity in the receiver
that I never want to experience. I value my maturity, and this giggling, even
just listening to it, was almost an insult to it.

And the thing that makes me hate it so much is that I know it is manipulative.
This giggling, whether she realizes it or not, and I don't believe that women
realize anything, at least it seems not, she is being manipulative with her
giggling. She was probably talking to a boyfriend, if I had to guess, and
laying down, looking at the sky, and shiffting her legs back and forth, sitting
in various positions, and giggling as she talked with this person. As she
giggled with the person. I know what that giggling prompts in me, it is a
feeling of "I must perpetuate this giggling with continued immaturity". Indeed,
if I say something that prompts a giggle, that is an indicator to me that I
have said something that I didn't want to say. If someone giggles with me, that
means I am saying the most disengenuous thing, and if the giggle is legitmate,
and I continue to perpetuate it, that means I am being wholly disengenuous to
everything that I believe.

But still, I sat there, and I drank my water, and I listened to the sounds, to
the birds, and the locusts, and the air conditioner. All of it whirred in that
sort of city white noise that you always here, and to add to that noise, was
this girl, talking on the phone, giggling to the recipient, and life was good.
I did not have to concern myself with the birds, they can chirp and I will
watch them chirp. I actually did so the day before, although I did not write
about it, but I watched a bird chirp like mad, and even when another bird came
up to it it just sat there on the branch chirping, like a broken siren or a
faulty alarm, just sitting and chirping with seemingly no purpose in mind,
before I grew disgusted at this bird and walked on. I was curious if there was
an object to it's chirping, or if it would stop chirping at some point, but it
literally just stood, and chirped, in different directions, pivoting on its
feet on the branch, bellowing it's tiny little body with each chirp, and that's
all it did. So my disgust won over my curiosity, and I walked on, never to
concern myself with this bird again. That is how I feel with this woman. Some
past version of myself might have looked on her and seen her and wanted to see
if I could find some memory material I could masterbate to. I would have played
out a fantasy where we met eyes, and she came up to my room, and we would have
sex, that would have been a fantasy that I might have played out in a past
life. Why, I remember when I was in Seattle, and I wanted to masterbate
(because finding the privacy to masterbate was difficult living in my car like
I was) so I stood behind a sort of wall that acted as a brick balcony to an
abandoned building there, outside one of the parks, and across the way, a good
ways from me so that she would not bother to look over to me, I saw a woman on
a jog. She was jogging, I forget what she was wearing, but probably some sort
of cute athletic clothing, the sort of athletic clothing that you see and you
say "Is that athletic clothing or is that a new designer fashion", some sort of
tight form fitting pants and a sports bra and some stylish top to go with it,
and when I saw her jogging by, I was instantly invigorated in my pursuit of
masterbation, and I used that scene to imagine that perhaps she saw me, and in
the middle of her jog she would come over and help out. I have always known the
absurdity of such fantasies, but they have always gotten me off, and made my
orgasms more intense, so I suspend my disbelief and indulge in them anyway. And
this girl, that Brett that suspends his disbelief, would have come up with some
sort of fantasy for this girl, but not so. Indeed, not only the fact that I
have made an active effort to try and abolish those sorts of fantasies from my
thought, and it is slowly making progress, besides that, the sound of her
giggling in the phone, and the extreme disgust I felt at hearing that, disgust
that borders almost on hatred, in the same way I felt disgust for that bird
that chirped to no end that I could see, I observed that disgust, but I knew,
that this girl was not one that I wanted to be in any part of my life, not in
reality and not even in my fantasy. That fantasy I no longer indulge in, not
only becasue I am not masterbating anymore, but because the fantasy wouldn't
work anymore. I would say "No, you reprehinsible whore, stop giggling and get
out of my life, I don't want you in that way. I have nothing aganist you as a
person, and I am totally content with you living out your life and giggling
with whoever you want, but I do not want that in my life, and I reject you on
the premise that you are an infernally immature human, and I seek to live in a
way to promote my own maturity, so you can giggle, but you will get no positive
reenforcment from me about it. So be on your way."

So many strong thoughts in one simple encounter. And this is the thing. I have
never considered myself a pervert or a creeper, but everything I have talked
about, especially when I play out these fantasys during masterbation, I think
that they do characterize me as a creeper. I hate that word though. That is
something I guess I would like to talk about some other time. I certainly to
not enjoy "creeping" in that sense, but I do think I have a tendency towards
that, in my basest nature, in the same way that I have had fantasies of rape in
my basest nature. I never act on them, and I don't act on my creeper
tendencies, but it might reveal something about my relationship with women that
I have not really examined before.

But for now I have to go. Getting out of myself will be good, I am going to BJJ
now to trian. I will be back, but probably not to write more about this. This
is probably the end of the journal for today, so I will leave it at that.

# 20180719 Dream My dad walks - I forget my shirt at work - Dream of the drug addicts in the elevator
So today I have something of a funny story to tell, something that could be
seen as a prophecy of one of my dreams from earlier, but really is just a funny
story. But before that I want to talk breifly about the dreams I had last
night.

So last night, I had a pretty continuous dream, from what I remember, but I
don't remember much of the actual dream. I remember really two moments, two
lines, and then I remember what most of the rest of the dream was about. Well,
I will say that most of the dream was about the concept of living with my
parents, but living in a different room, in my own space where I had my own
control over things, and I was wrestling with the idea, in the dream, that, if
it's my own room in my own space, how is it any different living with my
parents than it is living in an apartment entirely on my own? And I believe it
was Kyle who was talking about this at first, and he was making the argument to
me very logically, and I was conceding the fact that he was making logical
sense, but I knew that somehow there was a fundamental difference, and a lot of
the dream was spent in angst in that room, reflecting on this sort of thing.
That was the bulk of the dream, and one of the moments, the second and less
significant one, had to do with this. Now, there surely is something quite
enlightening to be had there, but I don't remember what else much happens in
the dream. Something I will say is that "my parents place" was really very much
like my apartment in college, but my parents were living in a "master bedroom"
of that apartment. It was a lot more like my dream version of my apartment, and
the whole landscape was very much like the dream version of school, with
waterview drive having this whole scenic overlook and everything. So that was
something to note, but beyond that I honestly don't remember much from the
dream except the first notable thing, which happened at the beginning of the
dream.

The notable thing was this. I know the scene was, my mom was at the stove of
my childhood home, and this version of my childhood home was a bit different
thematically than my childhood home, but structurally it was about the same. So
I was in this home, and I was standing near the pantry, which I'm not sure was
a pantry, but is where the pantry would be, and my mom was cooking something at
the stove, and Kyle and Evan I know were there, although they didn't have any
lines or anything, they were more just a reflection of me there, where as my
mom was not and she was more doing her own thing. So I am having a conversation
with my mom, about what topic I don't know, and as we were having that
conversation, my dad walks in through the front door. And this dream was very
striking to me, because it is the first dream with my dad in it, of late, which
was actually truely a premonition of him post hospital. He walked in, and he
was wearing the knee braces, but beyond that he had nothing for support, so he
was wobbly, but not so wobbly that he had to hold on to things, and he started
walking to us. And I remember thinking at that moment, "wow, he is walking very
well." and such, and I just sort of looked at him in a bit of amazement,
thinking that it's amazing how quickly he has been able to regain his health
and his walking capability. And he walked up to the room there, and he made
some comment, something like, "Well, what, did you think I wasn't going to get
better?" or something equally rough like that, and I said, "No, I just didn't
expect you to get better so quickly, it's amazing" and he sort of scoffed at
me, and we went back to our conversation. It wasn't long after that that left
my mom and dad, and went to my room in the house there, and it was then that my
mom and dad became not features of the dream but instead more like the
landlords of my apartment, and also it was then that the place transformed more
into my apartment like in college. And when I say transformed, I mean more
transformed in a dream like way that makes sense in the context of the dream,
and something more of a natural expression of the state of the dream, if that
makes any sense.

So yeah, enough of that dream. I do want to talk about my little incident this
morning, which I find quite amusing. So I woke up today in the sort of usual
way that I wake. I woke first at 7 (which is really 6) and I remember thinking
that I wanted to get up a little early so that I could get ready for work a
little early and be a touch more relaxed. So eventually, I got up at my usual
time of around 7:35, and I took my shower, brushed my teeth, and etc, and as I
went to evaluate the gi situation, I remembered that I had incidentally left my
gym bag in the car last evening when I got home from work, so I decided to put
my underwear and undershirt on, and some pants, and go outside and retrieve the
bag, come back up, and then resume with my morning routine. So I did that, I
put underwear and undershirt and pants on, and I went outside, and I got my gi
bag, and I came back up and I went on with my morning routine. So I rotated
some laundry, grabbed a gi, put it all in my bag, and I grabbed everything and
went on my way to work. It was not until I got out of my car at work, and
started walking towards my office from the lot, that I realized that I had no
shirt on. I literally made it all the way here wearing just an undershirt,
without a shirt on over it. Of course, I felt quite silly, and I immediately
evaluated my options. First option was, "Do I have a shirt in my car?" and I
immediately scanned my car in my minds eye and determined that no, I did not.
Next option was, "Should I go back to my apartment and put on a shirt?" and I
debated doing this, but I very much didn't feel like driving another thirty
minutes just to get a shirt. It seemed like such a trivial thing. So then the
next option I thought was "Just own it and go to work wearing just an
undershirt" and I immediately thought of my dream a couple nights ago. And I
determined, "This is not the dream, in the dream I was naked, and this is just
a shirt." but really it is quite the same as the dream. It is something that is
not at all a big deal to me, but would be a big deal to others if they knew
about it. It's the exact scenario of the dream, but the only difference is that
in the dream I was naked because it was more comfortable, and in real life, I
was not wearing a shirt because my morning routine was disrupted just enough
that I forgot to put a shirt on. So as I was there sitting in my car,
evaluating my options, I decided to put on my hoodie, and go up to work wearing
that, as I know hoodies are appropiate wear, and I remember a moment when I
first started working where David was wearing a hoodie, and in training, he
said that he was only wearing a shirt underneath, but he was wearing the hoodie
to hide the fact that he was wearing a shirt. So this was the best solution, so
I put the hoodie on, and I am currently sitting at my desk wearing just my
undershirt and hoodie. The whole thing is quite comical to me. To add to the
comedy of it, we had catered lunch last night (which by the way has me wholly
against bread, and is probably the last time I will eat bread) and from this
lunch we have a bunch of left over lemons, and the note had an allusion to the
"when life gives you lemons" mantra, but I just thought the whole thing was
amusing and fit this scenario quite well as well, so I took one of the lemon
slices, and squeezed it into my water (that's something that I have taken a
liking to lately when I drink water at home) and that's the state of things
now.

I do want to do some discovery writing later, so I will cut this article short
so that I have time later to do some discovery writing.

Holy shit, I totally forgot another, far more interesting dream that I had last
night. It just came to me in a moment, as I was reading some more of Brothers
11.09, and in a flash I all of a sudden remembered this entire section of the
dream. I don't remember what the story was, why I was in there, but I remember,
I got into an elevator. Now, this elevator was not at all like the sort of
elevator that you would imagine when I say the word elevator, this elevator was
quite large, like a freight elevator. It had walls all around, but it did not
feel constrained at all. It had two entrances, the entrance I came in, and the
"front entrance". There was something remarkable about this elevator. Indeed, I
do not know the full nature of the building that this elevator was a part of,
but I do know that it was some sort of judgment location. In this elevator,
which was in a circular shape all around, for the most part (at the very least,
it was not square, it could have been a sort of octogon, and there were
certainly parts of the wall which were straight) there were many people, all of
whom were in it for their own reasons, and all of them sitting there, waiting
to come to their stop to meet the judge. Some of the people there were almost
familiar with the scene, and others there were not, and were more baffled that
they were there, as if this were some sort of mistake, and that they didn't
deserve to be there. I could describe in so much detail some of these people,
and I think I will, because it seems important to me. I will say, that I
remember getting on this elevator at the top floor, and I was waiting for my
stop, which was near the bottom, not floor 1, but I think floor 2 or 3. In
fact, I did not care if it were two or three where I got off, just I knew that
it was not floor one. And on this elevator, I remember, one of the first stops,
a woman, with children, how many I don't know, but she had at least one in a
stroller, one on her hip, and another one or two that were with her and
associated with her, and all of this she had in the way that I imagine mothers
like to have. She was not burdened by her children at all, rather, she was the
sort of mother that you can find despicable, the sort that would seek to morph
and bend her children's will to her life. She had things in her life that she
wanted to do, and the well being of the children, well, she just kept them with
her because that was just the state of things, similar to how women keep a
purse with their things in it. She was treating these children as she would
treat the contents of her purse, valuble contents, but not more than that, not
treating them as young people, but treating them as items that needed to be
carried with her from place to place. And what I remember most about this
woman is that she very strongly felt that she didn't belong there, and that her
stop was one of the first stops, and she was hurrying her children along when
she exited on the 72nd floor, and she was much annoyed, almost as if she were
there to sort things out with the judge there. This woman did not strike me as
very significant, although now at this time of writing about her I find her
very significant, and I am very glad to have met her, I do not know her name,
but it would be something like the self-righteous mother. Yes, I have seen the
self righteous mother. There was another woman I know that was there, and this
woman was very much a sort of opposite of this mother. She was the sort of
woman, maybe not homeless, but she had that homeless wrinkled look about her,
as if she smoked a lot of cigarettes, and maybe had dome some harder drugs, but
drugs were not her issue, but her issue was more that she had just lived a very
hard and homeless life, but not maybe homeless, but just the sort that had
lived a hard life, and she would be the sort that if you address her in any
way to talk about anything, she would be the kind to always reply with a sort
of nihilistic way, like "what should I care, that your musings or questions or
problems or conversations have nothing to do with how I'm going to live in a
way that eases my suffering, so I will go back to my ciggarrette and continuing
living on in the way that has worked for me for all these years" something like
that. Although I did not speak with her, I only saw her there, and she struck
me also in the dream. So that was her. Around the edges, there were some other
people, and these other people I don't remember much. Most were very timid.
There was one woman who I remember who was quite fat, not obese my any means,
but certainly fat, and I remember her sort of being the kind that would go on
in the way that I think only fat people of that kind do, about the whole thing
here, in her good-natured fat person sort of way. She was the sort of fat where
you look at her, and you can imagine that her fatness was caused by her eating
a beach ball whole and inflating it in her stomach, so that her body from her
upper thighs where the fat of the thiighs meets the hips, to the fat below her
breasts, under her breasts, was a prefect sphere, not uncannily so, but just
that sort of body type, and her breasts, which were also very fatty and
neccisarily large, would rest on her stomach, and would the fat would go up
into a double chin sort of thing, but it wasn't really a double chin, it was
just a very large single chin, and in general she had this demeanor of that
sort of fatness. Indeed, the way I describe it makes her sound more fat then
she is, she was not obese, I want to emphasize that again, because obese is a
whole new level, but this woman was just fat. And she was the sort of fat
person that is so naive and good-natured that you can't hate them for being
fat, but you just have to sit there and smile, and laugh with her in her
good-natured way, because how can you not. ANd that was another person, and I
actually remember having a short conversation with her, since she was also the
person who would make conversation with anyone, and speak with them, and she
would always be your friend in her good-natured way, and she told me a bit
about what this place was, and what it was all about, that it was a sort of
place where people go down to their particular levels, and each different level
has a different sort of judge and that's what these people are here for. So
those are the people there that I remember around the edges, and I also
remember some asian brothers, teenagers, but I didn't talk with them or make
note of them, I just remember they were very scared and kept to themselves in
the corner. Then, in the center, and this was the main subject of what happened
in the dream, and I don't remember the timeline of when this happened in
relation to me talking with the fat girl (and the fat girl had a fat friend as
well, and they both were there and they were both good-natured, and they both
knew why they were there but they didn't dwell on it, and instead had
good-natured conversations about whatever such people have conversations about,
probably some sort of good-natured gossip amongst their circle of fat friends)
but regardless, in the center of this elevator, there was a fight that was
beginning to break out between two people there. Both of these people were
small women, and I use the word woman lightly. They were both very much women,
but they were both very visibly beaten by the world, in a different way than
the cigarette smoking woman, these both women were wretched souls. And what
they were fighting over was this. One of the women had a bottle of pills,
oxytocin if I had to guess what the pills were, and the other woman was
pestering her just to have a couple of the pills, and the first woman wasn't
willing to give any of them to her. There was no resentment or anything like
that, you could easily tell by both of their appearences (and I wish I could
describe them to do them justice, as their apperence was very vivid to me, but
the words to describe them are not coming to me) that they were both "druggies"
as someone of uncouth taste in describing people would call them. Let me try
and describe. The woman with the pills, she was probably in her forties, they
were prbobably both in their forties, but they were the sort of forties where
you look at them and you could guess that they could be anywhere from twenties
to forties, because the wear and tear that they have put on their bodies
through perpetual use of narcotics was very visible on their age. Now, the one
with the pills, she was a little better off than the one without, her skin was
a little better, and she had a little more meat on her bones, although they
were both very emaciated kind of skinny. The kind of skinny not of an anarexic
person, but instead the kind of skinny of someone who only eats because the
food makes it so they can subsist to their next dosage of whatever substance
they are addicted to. But the one with the prescription, and I do not know how
she came upon this prescription, it could have been prescribed to her but she
the methods that she went to get it prescribed to her were probably
illigitement if I had to guess, she was a little more meaty, as I said, and I
think had some mix of Black and Hispanic blood from her skin if I had to guess,
but she probably could have been missing some teeth, and her eyes, if you
looked into them, they would not be the eyes of someone who was entirely in
control of their life, but instead they were the eyes of someone who thought
that they had control of their life, but in reality, deep down, when you go
past that surface level, you can see that they knew that they didn't have
control. But it wasn't her that struck me so much, it was the other. The other,
she was I think entirely black, probably had some missing teeth although I did
not observe that, she was dreadfully skinny, not through starvation, but
instead like I said, only eating what she needed to to subsist from one dosage
to the next, and in her eyes was desperation. Desperation and suffering.
Indeed, I would say that this one had more of her faculties in her control than
the first. She was suffering. And so this is how the fight started to break
out. The desperate skinnier one, she at first asking calmly if she could have
just a couple of the pills that the first had, but in her very desperate but
calm way, and after being refused, she began to want to start the quarll there.
And I remember, this was a moment in the whole dream that I remember, they were
beginning to quarall, and the desperate one, I could tell that she felt no
disdain or hatred of the first, that she was simply desperate to have the
pills, and she only felt disdain towards the other in the sense that she really
wanted some pills, and the first was looking down on her almost in disgust at
her want for the pills, even though she herself was just as dependent on them
as the other was, and it was this sort of looking down on someone because of
their desperation for something that you have, that struck me, and it was in
this way that they continued to quarell. And I remember standing there, along
the edge of the wall, and my first thought was, "I should not interfere in the
affairs of others" but I saw that clearly their affairs were not being handled
in the best way, that they were clawing at eachother and beginning to fight
as cats might, and cats fighting, not playing but cats fighting, that is a
truly awful thing, and I saw that, I decided that they were not in control of
their affairs either, that it was the power of the narcotics and their
addiction to it that was in charge of their affairs, and so I decided that I
had the power to step in, and so I did, I got in between them, and I turned my
attention to the attacker. But I turned to her and used minimal neccesary force
to prevent her from continuing to assult the woman with the pills, and I tell
you that minimum neccesary force was not even physical force. Almost by my act
of getting in there and turning to her, she had defeated herself, and she
collapsed before I had even really made any move to subdue her. And the
one being attacked, the one the with pills just sort of turned to her with a
look of disgust, but I was there, and I sat her up and got a sort of control of
her from her back, and I tried my best to comfort her. She began wailing in
pain and agony, the sort of pain that could have been interpreted as the sort
of pain that some people feign to get what they want, but I knew that this was
not that, that this screaming was true pain, true suffering. She had been using
these narcotics to help her try and forget some dark element, so evil or
injustice of her past, some heart break or something of herself that she was
using narcotics to drown away, so now not only was the pain of withdrawal
coming to her, but the pain of that past which she used, it was coming up. She
was a wretched suffering soul. So I tried to comfort her. I just looked at her,
I didn't say words out of fear of saying something dreadfully stupid, which I
know I would say something stupid if I said anything, and I remember just being
there, controlling her body from the back, and feeling the utmost empathy for
her soul as my own soul, my own mind, tried to find the words in this
situation. And I remember saying somethnig like, after she had been wailing
like this for a long time and I was in this state of empathy and working my
brain analytically for the right words to say, I said something like "The
narcotics aren't there, listen to your body and feel your suffering, let it be
with you, I know your withdrawal hurts, but you just let it hurt" or something
like that, and I tell you those words now because something like those words is
what I had determined to say, but I don't think I really said those, and really
all I was saying was, "it's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I know it hurts, but
it's okay" and she got some comfort from that but she also wailed out, and I
remeber this "You don't know how this feels!" and I could determine that she
was in great pain, but I knew that she could withstand it, I saw that kindled
flame that never goes out was still alive in her, but it was so overdrawn by so
much pain and suffering. And I said "I know I don't, but it's okay, it's okay,
I'm here, I know it hurts, I know you are suffering" or something like that.
And at some point, I don't remember exactly what happened, if I appealed to the
other woman, or if the other woman did it on her own accord, (the woman I was
holding was now at this point in a state of suffering, and was no longer
pleading for the pills) and I think I did appeal to the woman now that I think
about it, I said, "Look at how this person is suffering, it could be you
suffering this way" and the woman, with a sort of disdain like "fine, if I give
you a couple pills then you will leave me alone." She took out two of the pills
and gave them to this woman, and she took them, and I tell you I could feel
that she almost felt guilty taking them there in front of me, but she took
them, and almost seeking my approval, I allowed her to take them. To be honest,
I did not know if that was the right thing or not, to let her have the pills,
but I certainly knew that telling her to abstain from them was not the right
thing to do, especuially when she had them in her hand, and I knew for sure
that it had to be her will, her choice to make that decision.

That was the main event of that dream, like I said, I don't remember the
timeline of it all, the mother was near the beginnig, but I forget when the
conversation with the fat chick happened with this whole event, and I also
remember actually getting down to the second or third floor and making my way
off, although that was the end of the dream if that happened. But this whole
event with these two "druggies" was the most profound aspect of the dream, and
the part that stuck with me the most and what I wanted to get out.

#20180720 Dream: Coffee disaster - Dragon and the King
So last night I did have a dream, it was a sort of short dream, but it was
there non-the-less. This dream was pretty brief and I don't want to dwell on
it. Basically, I was at work, and I was demonstrating to my co-worker the
proper way to make a french press coffee, and as I was doing so, I began
measuring out the amount, saying the importance of being precise with your
measuerments, and I placed it in the grinder, and ground it up using a burr
grinder, and everything was going fine and dandy until I put the coffee into
the press, and it filled up half of the press. At this, I did a bit of a sanity
check, and said, "hm, I must have measured it wrong" to which my grandfather,
who I think sort of showed up at the dream at that point, said, "Yeah, I think
you did." Well, the scene was still at my work break room, but in that room
there were my extended family, and some of my family I think but everyone there
was sort of in the background, and they were getting ready to go to easter
sunday church service, and I wasn't going, and my grandfather was there with
me, since he is catholic and always goes to the catholic service when the rest
of my family goes to the luthren service, and the times don't match up usually,
so it was just my grandfather and me there, and the rest of my extended family
was getting ready and making their way to service. So I started to empty the
contents of the french press, in hopes to salvage the coffee that I had ground,
and at this point I began making a whole mess of the situation. I was getting
coffee grinds everywhere, I took apart the french press and wasn't sure how to
put it back together, and since it was a dream the pieces were sort of changing
and morphing as I tried to put it together. That is, I would have piece A, and
I would place it on the counter, and I would grab piece B because piece B fit
into piece A, but as I went to grab piece B I would lose sight for a moment of
piece A, and as I went back to it, piece A would be an entirely different piece
than it was when I placed it there, call it piece C now. And so the pieces
began to multiply in the dream in this way, but I wasn't acutely aware that
that was what was going on, and instead I was just overwhelmed with the number
of pieces I was trying to put back together, on top of the fact that some
pieces were dirty with coffee grounds, and I didn't have a means to clean them,
or if I did I did not think to do so, and the entire thing turned into a whole
sort of catastrophe, and my grandfather mostly just watched there as I
struggled with this whole thing, and the last thing I remember was "Well, I
used to be good at this, and now I am just making a fool of myself," because I
was doing this to try and impress my colleagues at work. And that was the
extent of the dream.

So yeah, I don't want to dwell on that dream too much, I just wanted to write
it down before I did anything else. Currently, I have finished the dragon and
the king, and I want to go back through it and write a very critical analysis
on the syntax and tone of essentially every paragraph in there. I think I will
do that now. I might come back to this journal entry and extend it out a bit,
as I surely have more to say, but for now I really want to get to work on that,
and also get to work on my lit analyzer.

# 20180721 Dream in Kyle's house - Finished Reading the Brothers Karamazov
So I feel very strange right now. I am writing a journal article "on top of
another" so to speak. You see, I was at work yesterday, and as I was leaving
work, I remembered to commit my article, but when it came to pushing it, I
entirely forgot, so I have a commited journal article on my work laptop that
has not made it yet to this machine, and it makes me feel very strange that I
am contributing a commit that "skips a day" but which will be resolved later in
a merge that will happen when I get back to work on monday. Part of my
uneasiness here is my lack of experience with git, and I have enough experience
with git to know that the merge will happen reletively seemlessly, and that
when I go back and read this it will be in order, and I might even chuckle at
the fact that I am talking about how it is not in order right now, and how I
am fixating on that even foolishly. But enough of that.

I had a dream last night, that I don't think was a very eventful dream, but I
say that about all the dreams I have and I always end up writing an entire
fucking article about it, so what do I know about dreams. Regardless, I know
this dream took place in a sort of two part way. The frist part, I believe, I
was at a Five-K, and I was running this with my family, although I don't
remember any of the specifics about the race at all. In fact, I don't think
I even ran the race in the dream, as in, we ran the race, but that all happened
before the dream began, and so I don't have any memory of running the race, and
instead the dream started, and I was in the car with Kyle and my Mom, who also
ran the race, and we were on our way back home. And as we were coming back home
I remember saying we should go to Kyle's place, because he had just bought a
house, and he had been in it long enough for him to be "properly moved in" but
it was still a relatively new house, and we needed to "break it in" so to
speak. I also remember, I had an ice pack on me, I think on my leg or somewhere
like that, which is strange, because I don't have anything going on with my leg
right now, but I had an ice pack, so I said I would come to the house, and put
that pack in the freezer there. So we go to his house, and it was just me and
Kyle there, and this house is most similar to my memory of the house of the
Wrights, with the notable difference that the place where I'm pretty sure the
master bedroom was was really the kitchen, and the place where the kitchen was
was just more living area, and in the backyard, there was a pool. I want to
give a quick layout of Kyle's house. So at the front door, you walk in to a
living area, and to your immediate left, there is a staircase that goes to the
upper floor. This upper floor is open, and there is a common living area in the
upper area like there is in the lower area, and they are very much open to
eachother. So on the lower floor, there is a door to the backyard in the back,
which is a rather skinny backyard, but goes all the way around and had a pool
to the side which is in a sort of kidney shape, and has a shallow end at the
closest end to the backdoor, and a deep end on the other end. As you walk to
the back door from the front, to the left is a kitchen, and on the other side
of that is another sort of entrance, a more "grand" entrance, where visiters
would come, and in that area beyond the kitchen, it goes up all the way to the
ceiling (the second floor ends at the end of the kitchen) and that would be
where you would have guests come over for dinner. So if you were to go up the
stairs, you would go up to the common area, and this area is very much like the
house of the Wrights, and to the left there is a hallway with bedrooms. So now
that we have said that, I enter by the front way, rather than the "guest" way,
because we are not guests but instead we are just going there to hang out, so
that's the appropiate way in, and I go into the kitchen to put the ice pack
thing in the freezer. I explore the house a little, I remember that, although
all of the details I have of the house right now are from me conjuring up my
memeory in this waking moment of my "conscious" memory of what the house should
be, rather than recollection of the exploring. Mostly, I explored the upstairs
area, as that's the point I remember most. Anyway, I remember asking Kyle about
the state of the pool, and he said that it was possible to swim in it, so I
decided to go out and do so. So we go out, and I evaluate the water, and
determine that it is indeed appropiate to swim in, so I get in, and wade around
a bit, and I swim over to the deep end. And I remember, while we were there,
Kyle was trying to experiment with lotus position, while wading in the pool,
and I was able to do it quite a bit better than him, and then I swam to the
deep end (it was after this that I swam over) and I said to check this out, and
I started doing some wim hof breathing, but only three or four breaths, before
letting go and holding it, and sinking to the bottom, and establishing lotus
psotion in the bottom of the pool, and I held it there for only a couple of
seconds, because it's hard to hold your breath like that underwater, so I came
back up, and I did that maybe two or three times. The last thing I remember
about the dream is that Mom came out to the backyard with a very young and
dorky version of Evan, and he was wrapped in a sort of shawl, and she was to
cut his hair. The sort of shawl I mean is the kind of shawl you wear when
someone is cutting it to keep the falling hair off of you. I'm sure it probably
has a proper name, but that was the end of the dream.

So yeah, the only notable thing about this dream is that Kyle had bought a
house and that he was living alone in it. The layout of the house was
interesting, and that was about it.

And now I'm just really sad. I was planning on working on my revisions of the
dragon and the king, but now I realize that my analysis and other aspects of
that work are also sitting commited locally and unpushed on my work
machine, which is at work, and god knows that I don't want to go up there and
get it. I don't even have a key to the place, so it's lost forever to me now
until I can get up there again on Monday it will be and actually push the
commit. This has me dissapointed.

So right now, I have a sort of inclination towards a few things. Part of me
wants to work on that analysis anyway, I can figure out the trivialities of the
merge later, and another part of me wants to work on my lit analyzer tool,
which changes I believe I do have the latest of, which is good. Then another
part of me wants to just free write about anything and everything, which is
sort of what I have been doing, but I have no particular aim in mind, nor do I
feel particularly inspired to discover say, more about Damien, or Kimberly, or
Racheal, or Lyse, or anyone else.

Actually, I have thought about that whole story, and I had an idea that I find
somewhat amusing, and that idea is to put the whole thing in sonata form. So
the exposition, and then the repeat of the exposition, would be the two stories
by the hermit, then the development would be the characters reading it I think,
and then the recapitualiton would be something else. That is a wholly contrived
and silly way to put the whole thing, putting it into words like that, but the
idea is that I want to create a work which does fit into sonata form. So there
would be "the first movement" which would have the exposition, and that
exposition would be repeated, but from a different angle, and then the
development, and then a final recapitulation. So the expositon would be like
someone learning something, then failing, then trying again, then failing, then
the development would be the formation of a plan, and the recap would be doing
that thing for real, and succeeding. Something like that. Then the second
movement would be the doings of the bad guy, and the bad guy has a main theme,
something like the destruction of a village, or something, interspersed with
moments of planning with his minions, or something of that nature, so there
would be three villages that get destroyed, and in-between that, we would have
interludes, in the ABACA format. Then, I don't know what a menuet would look
like, and in this particular story, of "Good guy bad guy" sort of paradigm,
there probably wouldn't be a menuet, and we would go straight into the rondo,
of the good guy and the bad guy clashing, and there would "the battle at the
final grounds" or something, and they would fight, and that would be the main
theme of the rondo, and in the first fight the bad guy gets the upper hand,
and the good guys go on about the bad guy, then they fight again, but this time
there isn't really a fight, as maybe a natural phenomenon stops them before
they can clash, which would be the center of the rondo, and then they fight
again, and the bad guy gets the upper hand again, but this time the good guys
have an ace up their sleeve, maybe something they gleened during the time they
almost fought, so in the last encounter, the ace up their sleeve is taken out,
and that's the finale, and they defeat the bad guy, and everyone is victorious.
Something like that. It's interesting to me how Sonata form does give way to a
sort of outline for a story like that. However, I think this association does
one good to see it as the outline for an original story, and trying to impose
sonata form on any arbitrary work of art, that would be silly. Indeed, there
are many stories that are written which don't have this sort of form. Surely
there are a lot that do, but it's one of those things that with any sufficient
literary force, you can bend the plot of any work to whatever structure you
want to impose on it. Maybe, maybe not, I don't know.

I do want to give my opinion, somewhat raw, after reading the end of A
Brother's Karamazov. Now, I will be entirely honest and say that I did not read
the entirety of the end of the story. I got up to the point where the
Prosecuter made his speech, and I was part way through that when I decided to
skip through the prosecuter speech, and read the end of the defendents speech,
and at that, I skipped to the end of the epilouge, and read the end, that being
Ilusha's funeral. Something I will say is I love the ending. The speech Aloysha
gives to the children was perfect, tying up the experience of youth, and how
such experince can transform you into adulthood, and how even just one such
experience can be clung on to with success. I found that to be such a fitting
speech, even though I don't fully understand all of the implications of the
different threads at this point. So I liked that a lot, and I like a lot too
how at the end of it, he said something like, "And lets go eat pancakes, even
though its a silly tradition, silly traditions are sometimes the best" or
something like that. I could go read the quote, but it was something like that.
I love that. And then the last paragraph, cheers for Karamazov, was just, the
entire thing was such a fitting ending to the novel.

What I will say, and this is something that I have encountered with novels like
this, is that it felt like there were so many loose ends. Like I said, I
skipped over some bits, so I will have to go over and read the parts I skipped
(really just the ending, although I skipped over the life of Zossima as well),
but I remember thinking that there were a ton of loose ends. Like, what happens
with Lise? I am sure her story would be a central subject of the sequal which
will tragically never be written. And what is the fate of Katya? And the fate
of Mitya and Grusha? Do they go to america? Does he escape his conviction. That
last point is less relevent to me, and I like that it was left sort of hanging
like that. And I hate when people say "well, it's up to the reader to decide"
because it's not. It's up to the reader to read what was presented, and the
readers reaction to it is simply what the reaction is, and that reaction should
be pure. And I think, to ask questions about "what happens to such and such
character" are really silly questions most of the time. You see, the fates of
these characters are not really important. I think it's important to make the
work "fluid" in the sense that it is not a strict X happened then Y happened
and Z happened and all of the loose ends are tied. Of course, the reader has to
have some resolution, and we got quite a bit of resolution now that I think of
it.

I think, the biggest question I have is "So what was the actual story about the
3000 roubles" and "What happened to the inheretance of Fyodor?" And both of
those things might have been addreessed in the parts I missed, so I will hold
off on those questions until I study the work further.

But back to my original point. I think it is important to have loose ends in a
sense. That creates a more powerful message. And I don't mean message as in,
"what is the message the author is trying to protray here" because such an
interpretation of literature is immature at best, (although maybe not quite as
immature as a literal interpretation as literature as a story, so maybe the
word "misguided" is better) but I think that the work as a work of art has much
more impact when the story under the story is allowed to take the fore front,
and the story that's in the front has these loose ends, because without these
loose ends, the story under the story doesn't have a chance to shine through.
Indeed, the story is one of psychology. Of all these different characters, all
of which have their own motivations and personalities, what happens to them all
in this circumstance.

Something I will say, that is quite funny to me, is the nature of the trial. It
was very fictional, almost fantastically so, to put "the trial" like it was,
with all of its events and speechs. It was very glorified, and the notion that
so many hearts could be moved by the events of the trial is very literary in
its telling. Indeed, I have not been to an actual trial like this one, and I
don't know how things are done in Russia, but I don't think that he would be
convicted so quickly (indeed, as I was looking into death row inmates in my
curiosity one time, it turns out people stay on death row, and undergo multiple
kinds of trials on the path there, so yeah), and I don't think that so many
liberties would be given to the people there to give these broad and all
encompassing speechs.

One comment I will also make about the story is, that it seemed EVERYONE became
ill after the conviction. For instance, Smyrgadov have a massive epileptic fit
after the murder makes sense to me, and Grusha coming down with illness makes
some sense, and Ivan's illness makes sense as well, it was all used to great
effect, and honestly, now that I write about it, I don't know if I would change
any of it, but regardless, it was something that struck me as almost comical.
Like the old man is killed and everyone comes down with some sort of mental or
physical illness. I remember thinking something at one point like "Is there
anyone who isn't becoming ill after this whole event?" and the answer is that
only Alysha and the school children are not, which is also partly why I liked
the ending so much.

So I think my final impression of the novel is this. I think it is one of the
most well written and well told novels of our time. Even the translation, which
I have read a couple, shows the sort of clarity with which Dostoeyevsky can
write. His descriptions, while long at times, never feel superflous, and they
all contribute to the characters and the scene that is being set. I also very
much like his use of the narrator. Something that the narrator said a lot was,
or at least in a few occasions was, "but that event will be told in it's proper
place" and I like that method a lot, because it goes to show that a good work
of art can't be spoiled, because even the author, the narrator himself, is
"spoiling" the work by telling you what is going to happen, and giving you a
promise of more details later. So I like that a lot. Also, I like that we are
given insight into the reactions of the characters. It never feels like the
characters go against their nature, and we are given a very clear picture of
what all the characters are, and what they do, as they do the things, and their
motiviations are always known, even if they are surprising to us, we are never
surprised in a way that says "well okay, I can suspend my disbelief about that
character to accept that this contrived event is happenening."

And the last thing I want to say is, the way in which it was revealed that
Smergadov hanged himself literally took my breath away. It was at the end of
the chapter, and as soon as that chapter ended, I put down the tablet and just
reflected on the whole chapter. Indeed, I know people talk about the Grand
Inquizitor as "the chapter of the work" but indeed I think it was this chapter
which takes it all for me. It was so beautifully written, the anguish of Ivan
is so wall captured, the fact that he is convinced that the entire thing is
real. Just perfect, absolutely perfect. I love it, and to me that marks the
best moment of the novel. That, and I loved the narration of Mitya as he goes
through the town, goes to his fathers, beats Grigory on the head, and then goes
and spends all sorts of money entertaining the characters, that entire section
was very well written as well, and I breezed over that without concept of time
or chapters, and I genuinely wanted to read more. The way that Mitya was caught
as well, the way Grusha and he were coming together, and that was their moment,
the moment he was going to go away and carry her off and be free with her, that
was the moment that he was arrested, I like that juxtopositon, if that is the
right word, and I think that was used to great effect as well.

In conclusion, very well written novel, and one that I am so blessed to have
been exposed to and read in my life. Indeed, it is the sort of novel that makes
me glad to be alive, because if there had been nothing in the world, this novel
would not have been in the world either, and I could not have read it. It makes
me glad that there is something, rather then nothing.

# 20180722
So today I have made some coffee again, and I have not taken my first sip yet,
and I am wary to, but I will limit myself this time to simply a liter of coffee
and see how that makes me feel.

So last night I did not have many dreams. Indeed, last night was strange for
me, so let me just go over a bit what happened.

So everything was going well in the day yesterday. The day before, I went
pretty intense at open mat, started standing with a lot of guy, practiced
takedowns and throws, and I think the bottom line is that there are a bunch of
killers at my gym, and they are very good at doing what they do, so I became a
little beat up as a result. Well, yesterday when I woke up, which was around
8:30, I felt entirely beat up, way more than I anticipated, and I spent most of
the day reading, listening to Peterson's lectures on the biblical stories, and
in general just doing regular lazy saturday things, and it got to be around 5,
and after I had my shake, I pretty promptly collapsed onto the floor and went
to sleep. After I woke up, I had this inclination to go straight to target and
get a meat pounder, among some other things, so I went over, it was I think
safe to say two full sleep cycles later, and I was still in a daze when I was
going, I came to a stop at one of the stop signs, and I distinctly remember
saying to myself, "fuck it there is no one here" and as soon as I took a pretty
egregious rolling stop, I realized that coming up behind was a car that seemed
to me to be a police officer. Well, in my state I just woke up, I was like
"fuck it, let him stop me" but I behaved much more like a good civilian at the
next stop sign, and he went on his way. Now as this happened, I remember
thinking two things. One, my registration is still out of date, so even though
I have the inspection papers in my car, I'm not sure if that would have made
any difference at all. Second, the address on my license is still wrong,
although I did not even think about that. What I really thought is, "What is
that?" Did he look into my window and see that I was white and let me off? Was
this cop actually sympathetic to the fact that I was being safe at the stop and
knew that letter of the law is not the law? Or was he maybe at the end of his
shift, and driving home, when that happened? I don't know. Is that mercy? And
then I thought, well, it would only be mercy because he has given himself
authourity of others in the first place, and it's in that elevated position
that he does what he does. For instance, is it mercy if I see a rolling stop
and "let the guy off?" No of course not, I just don't give a shit. I'm sure I
could probably take note of the guys license or something, but without proof or
anything that would be a rather silly police call. "Hey, I was driving by Royal
Lane, and I noticed at the intesection of that street and Kinwest, going
southbound along Royal, a car with the license plate of 123 ABCD made a rolling
stop, and I wanted to report this incident to the police, because of my sense
of justice." It's absurd. Now imagine this, suppose it were an actual crime,
something like, "So I was at XYZ location, and I saw someone standing on the
roof of a car with license plate FGH 4567 making grafiti on the stop sign,
covering completely and writing "GO" over the letters." Now, there is no proof
of that crime either. There is proof of the crime, but it's simply my word that
that person did it. In fact, I think the fact that I called in makes me a
suspect in the crime. And that crime, do I give a shit? I give more of a shit,
but if I saw something like that, I would be more inclined to say to myself,
"Wow, okay, be careful at that sign now, because I know it should be a stop
sign, but other people might not, and until it gets fixed, it will be slightly
more dangerous to go by that intersection, as people might not know to stop,
and run right through it." So instead my reaction is not "Condemn that man" but
instead, "Okay, I should be more careful now." I suppose it would be my duty as
a tax paying citizen to at least report that to the police, but I don't want to
call the police, and honestly, instead of calling the police, I would want to
call the "National assembly of road signs" or whoever is responsible for the
signs and lights of the roads to let them know that a sign has been grafitti'd.
And then, I would even have an inclination to want to volunteer to help get the
sign replaced, but that is something like, I would be more of a hindrance to
try and volunteer for a thing like that than I would be a help, so I don't know
if that makes any sense at all.

So yeah. I don't know, I just find it amusing that I thought "That officer
showed me mercy just there." but instead of being grateful to him, instead I
just think, "maybe there are good police officers in this world," which I know
to be true, but still, it's hard to recognize that sort of thing, especially
since I am bitter at my experience in jail still. I am grateful for it, but I
suppose you could say I am gratefully bitter about it. I am grateful for the
cross I bear, would be something Jesus might say, although this isn't really a
cross, as I am not to be hung on it. Essentially, what this is, the justice
system gave me a cross to bear, and I said, "No, wait a minute, it's not my
time to bear this cross, can I haul my cross to the First Offender program and
return it?" and for the price of a lawyer and 180 days of sobriety and
probation, I can return the cross that I bear.

Indeed, that is an interesting question. Does it mean anything to willfully
bear your cross if you know you are not going to be hung on it? The question
becomes, what would Jesus do in that situation? Jesus surely would not have
turned the marijuana into orregano. That would be the comedians answer to that
question. Maybe this story is not akin to the crucifixion more than it is
similar to the forty days in the desert, but instead of forty days, for me it's
more like a year, and instead of the desert, for me it's just sobriety and
community service. That is a better picture.

I want to read the house of the dead, for sure, that is a book that I very much
want to read. In fact, I do want to get to a point where I feel satisfied with
my lit analyzer. That was what I dreamt about mostly last night. Last night,
after I came back from the store and ate some food, I spent most of the rest of
the day downloading and parsing a bunch of novels from Gutenberg into the
appropiate short story/novel/chapter layouts. I spent about three hours doing
that, much to my amazement, and I am very glad I did. Now, what I want to do is
get my "reading and note taking" workflow down to a science, and I mostly
dreamt about organizing that, and having my lit analyzer actually do that. All
I need it to do is take my notes, and create a reference and a tags file, and
once I do that I will feel so much better about my notes. It's just, I haven't
gotten there yet, and I will feel uncomfortable about reading until I do. You
see, I have parsed out Mommsen and Gibbon, both are now in a readable chapter
sort of format, but until I get note-taking down, I don't want to invest myself
into those people, because those are the sorts of works I only want to read
once, and I don't want to "read" and then "read again with the intention of
taking notes" or at least, if I do read it that way, I want to do it in one
sitting. Like, at night I read a chapter of one of them, and then during the
next day, I make all of the notes I could want for those people. I want to go
from start to finish only once. Because at this point, I have read all of the
Karamazov Brothers, and I will gladly go through and read it again, this time
taking detailed notes, but I need to have my note taking scheme written in
order to do that, so I'm at a bit of a loss here. All of that to say, I plan to
spend most of this afternoon working on my lit analyzer, and getting to the
point where I can parse my notes into an object, and have that object write a
reference and tags file out. And that's what I dreamed about, I dreamed about
having that whole thing organized out.

So enough about that. I have had an idea about my hermit story, that I think
will make it work. I have run into this problem with the story, where I at
first thought I liked the idea of having a murder be the central conflict of
the story, but the more I discovered aspects of that, the more it didn't work,
so instead I started thinking to myself, "why does there have to be a
conflict, maybe the people just exist, and the whole thing is there
conversations about the thing," but then I don't know how to end it. So I have
had this idea that, this is how it works. In the first writing of the Hermit,
he tells about his experience, and in the second writing, he commands the
reader to kill someone, and when they don't do it, it turns out that that
someone turns out to be a suicide bomber, and he blows up a community center,
or something, and that creates the central conflict.

But that whole thing seems somewhat silly, but I like it anyway. I have just
been thinking about my other character, the one that I called Lyse, but whose
name is not Lyse. I will discover his name later, but this is the character who
is the "voice of the most obvious".

So Lyse, he had a rough upbringing. His parents were abusive, and I could
discover something about his parents, maybe they were drug addicts, they were
addicted to some substance, and they were always poor, he was always moving
from school to school, never fitting in. So that is his background. He got into
marijuana when he was thirteen, and harder drugs later in life, he would
shoplift and steal from the cops. At this point, I am very much out of my
element, as I don't have any of these sorts of experinces, but I have heard
about them in TED talks and things like that, so I can pretend like I can write
about it.

When he was a teenager, maybe sixteen, let's say, he had a moment, I think one
of his best friends dies in some sort of altercation. I don't think he was
responsible in any way, his friend was doing something, but maybe he couldn't
participate for some reason, and he is killed in gang related violence.
Something like that. And this is an eye-opener for him. He goes to the funeral,
and he is hurting, and that's when he meet's someone that invites him to a
church, something like that, and not knowing where to turn, he goes to the
church. And at his first visit to the church, the sermon speaks to him.
Something like that, and he feels the presence of god enter into him. I'm not
so sure about that. I don't like that. I think instead, he goes, and he finds
that whole thing sort of ridiculous. I think that is a sort of one off
experince. But then later, pretty soon after his friend was killed, he gets
busted by the cops. Maybe someone in their friend group, someone that blames
him for that friends death, narks on him, and busts him, and he goes to juvi,
and spends some time there. And in order to lessen his sentence, he is required
to do some community service hours. And in seeking an avenue for community
service, he turns back to the church that he went to that one day. And as he
joins, he might say something like, "The notion of an invisible man that talks
to someone is absurd, but these people have community service work that doesn't
suck, and it looks good to the prosecutor that I am attending church now, so I
will go this route." I like that. And as he does more community service work,
he gets clean, but like any human, he slips occasionally back into drugs, but
the system is forgiving of him, and eventually he gets his life together.

Now, I want this man to be pretty intelligent. He might say something like,
"The whole notion of an invisible man in the sky that puffed into existence the
world in six days is rather absurd, but my time with the community of the
church really saved me from a dark and dangerous path, so it can't be all bad."
And in his time there he comes to have a sort of appreciation for the people
there.

And that's where he meets Susan. Susan and he don't date, in fact there is no
romantic interest between this man, whose name is not Lyse, but whose name will
come to me later, and Susan, but they become friends. And Susan is very
concerned for the salvation of this man. Susan and he have discussion as they
do community service together, and she is always concerned about his belief in
God. She might say something like "I'm worried about you," (and his mother is
white and his father is black, so I know this guy is half black, and mostly
associates with the black race more than the white) "I see that you're a good
person, but I don't want you to go to hell just because you don't believe" and
he would reply something like, "Well, if there is a god, maybe he will see that
I am a good person and pardon me for not accepting the absurd notion that
someone 2000 years ago literally came back from the dead. That's a pretty
absurd claim. I think it's more important to remember to love thy neighbor than
to have faith in a physical impossiblity that happened so many years ago. I
would hope that an all knowing and benevolent god would recognize that." and
they would get back to their volunteer work.

Now Susan, she is the typical "over-Christian" bitch that is so hateable. She
was born into a well to do family, was fed her baby food with a silver spoon in
her mouth (which is an anachroism, and something I don't want to say again),
but she means well by her actions, and most of all clings to "her church
friends and church community more than anything". She is the kind that would
post her latest sunday morning outfit on instagram, with a bible verse talking
about how you have to "give got your sunday best" (I should find a verse where
it says something like that on the sabbath), and it would get hundreds of
likes, because she was that sort of girl. She is very self-righteous. In fact,
I very much like the idea of finding a girl like this on instagram to model her
after. I should follow people on instagram just to get character ideas.

That's actually a really cool idea. I like that a lot. There are so many
"Instagram characters" and they can give me ideas for actual good characters.
It would even give me ideas for names as well. Oh, I like that idea a lot. I
might do that after I finish with this.

So yeah, that's a pretty good idea for Susan and my half-black friend. I want
my half-black friend to be the first to accept the notions of the hermit, after
being presents irrefutable proof. Kimberly is my reasonable skeptic, but this
half-black friend is the first to accept the notions as "un-denialy true" and
Susan is the one dismiss them on the notion of "that's unbiblical and it can't
be true if it doesn't fit with the stories in the bible" and Damien is the one
to say, "There must be something we are missing, these notions can't be true."

So yeah. I need to discover more about Kimberly and Susan, although I have a
pretty good idea about what Susan is like, and Kimberly, well, she is the most
like me I think, except that she is a female, but we'll get there.

I like where this is going. The thing is, I still don't know where to end it,
and I still don't know the best way to tie it in with Flat-Earth. Also, I have
an issue of tone. I want this to be partly satire, which is why I like the
command by god to murder someone before he does something horrible, and I like
the fact that he will bomb a school to be the "proof that this whole thing is
true". But I don't know how to end this story. I want a very comical tragedy.
Maybe, my half-black character dies in the bombing. I like that. I still don't
know his name, but I know about his death. I like that quite a bit I think.
That can be the conflict, and at his funeral, Kimberly could place the writings
of the hermit. Susan needs to die as well. And Damien. How do they die? Susan
could die of sudden illness. Damien dies trying to experiment about the flat
earth, he goes to a remote location, somewhere far north, and as he discovers
the flat earth, he is killed by people from NASA. I like that. Like, he goes to
antarctica, to see this, and as he looks into it more and more and starts to
discover that maybe there is something to it, so eventually he gets on a
flight, and takes a boat to Antarctaca from the southern tip of South America,
and he witnesses the great ice wall, and maybe there is even a doorway,
something that was mentioned in the works of the hermit, but some agency, the
agency that "controls NASA" kills him there, and covers their tracks
completely. And they poison Susan. Actually, I like Susan just coming down with
fever and dying. As if her lack of faith in flat earth causes her illness. I
don't like that completely, but it's pretty good. I'll have to work on that.
And I like Damien dying in Antarctica. And I like the whole thing ending with
Kimberly taking the works of the hermit and burying them with my half-black
character at his funeral, with the implication that those were the instructions
in the second writing of the hermit.

This is coming together. Satirical tragedy. I like it. I will need to discover
at some point, first the writings of the hermit, then some more interactions of
the characters.

I like the idea of Kimberly actually visiting the god of the Flat Earth, and
getting the message that she is not the one to spread the message, and that
clearly the people are not in a state to know the truth. She will recieve
instructions to place the works of the hermit in some place, I'm not sure
where, but with instructions that "our time is limited, I will give you sign,
and when you see it you will know. You will do great things, Kimberly, just
know that your reasonableness, and your patience will be rewarded in the
afterlife." and at that she wakes up in the hospital, she recovers quickly, and
when she gets out, she has a shoebox or something where she has the works of
the hermit, and her neice tells her about a time capsule that they are making
as a school project, and aunt Kimberly says she wants to add her shoebox to the
mix. She writes a letter, adds it to the shoe box, buries the time capsule with
her neice, and then dies in a car accident literally as they are leaving from
burying the time capsule.

I like how this is developing a lot. Like, a lot a lot. Everyone dying in their
own way is cool. I love it. Holy shit, I think I've actually discovered it.

I just need to discover the relationships. I think I want a Brett character to
be a flat earth fanatic, and he dies before the entire thing, and all of these
four characters are connected through this Brett, and it's Susan and my
half-black character who first find the writings of the hermit. I need someone
other than my half-black character to die pretty early on. Actually, Brett
could be the one to discover the writings of the Hermit. Brett is actually
something of a hermit himself, and he discovers the writings, and he is on a
hermitage retreat, and finds the writings, and he is so excited that he writes
a letter to his friend Damien. But he actually dies of natural causes at the
retreat, maybe a bear or something comes in and infiltrates the retreat, and
it's not until they don't hear from him that Damien realizes that Brett has
been killed. So Damien, who knew Brett from school but hadn't kept in touch,
gets the letter from the hermatage people, so he and Kimberly go and visit the
scene, and it's there that Brett's half-black friend and Susan, it's there that
they all meet for the first time.

So last night after I wrote this journal article was interesting for me. I
think I just want to go into it and describe what has happened.

So after I finished the article, I had about maybe a cup of coffee left, and I
decided that I didn't want to finish it and poured it down the drain. At that
point, I was wholly decided that I wanted to go out for some exercise. This was
a sort of natural instinct, as I was feeling that sort of "out of body"ness
from coffee that I feel, and I very much wanted to get back into my body, and I
hadn't had proper exercise in a few days at least, so I decided it was time.
And thinking back on it, I could have thought about how it would be good to let
the creative juices "refuel" so to speak, after I had just discovered so much
about how I want my hermit story to go, that I thought that maybe I needed my
brain to reset. But the thing is, I was not thinking about that at all, I was
not thinking about my characters at all, not about writting or anything like
that. I literally just went, and I got involved in the workout. It was great. I
think it was a perfect indication of "the zone" that people talk about. This is
what I did.

With a continuosly running clock. Run 200m (I kept to about a 45 second pace
here, at 3in/1out breathing scheme) then at 2:30 jog back to the start. Then,
with a 4in/2out scheme, run 800m (I kept to about a 5 minute pace on this). I
did this four times, each starting at nine minutes. So It looked like 200m run,
slow jog back (and I kept to 6/2 scheme there), 800m run, then a minute and a
half of rest. In the minute and a half, I was keeping to the heavy breathing,
and did a short hold then inhale and compress cycle just before I started the
sprint, which created a very interesting effect. In all, I did about five k
worth of running.

I say all of this, one because I very much paid attention to my breathe the
entire time, and this was the first time that I really felt that I was using
breathe in a meaningful way throughout the workout, and I could use that to
gauge my effort levels. But more I say this for this reason. After the whole
thing, I finished with one final exhale and inhale release cycle, and I used a
tree to lean on to make sure I didn't collapse or anything, and after I was
done, I climbed the tree to finish up my rest and cool down. While I was up in
the tree, I saw some small little leaves sprouting up there, and I thought
about Peterson talking about Chimps how we evolved from them by the discovery
of fire and the weilding of that to cook meat, and I thought, "I'm already up
in the tree, fuck it," and I plucked off one of the leaves of that tiny little
sprout, and I chewed it in my mouth. I was not brave enough to swallow it,
(imagine that story, man eats dirty leaves from the tree and contracts disease
xyz) but I did chew on it for quite a bit, and spit it out and just sort of
chuckled at myself. I then used my monkey grips to ease myself off of the tree,
and when I got back to my apartment, I ate some raw ginger root with kale, then
some raw tumeric root with kale, and I took a shot of apple cider vinegar, and
I felt very raw as I did all of this. It was quite a cool experince, and I
thought about how my caffinated self was feeling out of body, and I still felt
that to some extent, but I thought about how differently this work out would
have gone had I not caffinated myself before hand.

Anyway, after this, I was still sweaty, wearing my breifs and athletic shorts,
and I just sat down in my chair that I have set up in my apartment, and I just
started reading Poor Folk. And as I started reading, I only intended to read
the first few letters (the work is written as a series of letters, similar to
dracula, I forget the name for that sort of work) but as I kept reading I
decided to just keep going, and I eventually read the whole thing. Now, at this
point I could stop and talk about the novel, and what I thought about it, and
to give my very breif opinion, "I thought it was very good, and I liked the way
poverty and desperation of poverty is addressed", but more I say all of this to
say that I was able to read the 120 pages pretty much non stop, with very
minimal distraction. There were a couple times I got distracted and had to go
back and re-read what I had already read, but for the most part I was able to
get through the entire thing pretty un interupted. Towards the end I was
getting a little drogy, I stopped caring about some details. For instance,
there were a few relatives of the girl in the novel who started to come in
towards the end, but instead of trying to figure out if I had heard of them
before, or try and get who they were exactly and how they fit in the whole
thing, I just read through them, and got to the point where I was just "getting
to the end to finish it". And I got to the end, and I really like the way it
ended. But my whole point is, by the time I finished, it was nearly five
o'clock, and I don't remember exactly what time I finished my journal article,
I could maybe look at commit history, but my point is that there was so much
concentration after I finished the coffee, it quite astounded me.

So after I ate some beef (and I am very much liking my beef tenderizing mallet)
I spent most of the rest of the evening studying Russian tenses and
declinations and things like that, and I started to create some cheat sheets on
some index cards, but really what I need to do is take a word stem, and figure
out all of the ways that words stem can be modified, and start to put the
actual word stems on the cards. Somethnig also, I want to say, is fuck Russian
cursive, I am going to print in Russian the same way I print in english, and I
will only look at the cursive for the purpose of knowing what italics will say.

So after that, I read Prometheus Bound, by Euc ... something I don't know, but
I read it and it was good. I liked it a lot, actually, it addresses the nature
of the god to do what is good and right, and accepting his punishment in spite
of that. And Prometheus has privy information from the muses about the fall of
Zeus, and still he does not reveal it even when Hermes comes as messenger.
Pretty neat play.

So I do want to say that I entirely did not get at all any progress towards my
lit analyzer, but I feel that I have in my head what I want to do, it's just a
matter of getting it started. I have been able to use the gui I have created to
streamline the process of getting something from the source to the individual
markdown files, and now the goal is to get something from annotated markdown to
a reference and tags file. I have this notion that I want to have a "seperate
notation" file for how I read, but that would not display on my tablet very
well, at all actually, and I really want to be able to use my tablet to create
these annotations pretty seemlessly, so that's not going to work. I just need
to actually start on it, which I think I might have to force myself to do after
lunch or something today.

So after that, it started getting late, and I had to get myself into the other
room to put some mindless hearthstone tournament on so I could go to sleep. And
so I went to sleep, and as I was waking up, I had a fleeting dream. The dream
was at the location of Yoga, but with Colin there, as if it was his house or
something, and his daughter was there, but this was not Camryn, his actual
daughter, but a dream person who just was her daughter. Now this girl, this
daughter, I don't know her name, she was the kind that was exactly what you
would expect from a daughter, she was sixteen and a little plump, and very
girly. And I followed her, because she wanted to show me her "side house" or
something. Basically, in the parking lot of the yoga, in the corner, was set
aside for her her "play house" and this play house was a sort of life size
dollhouse, where she actually had a porch she could sit on, with a chair, but
those were the only things that were actually accomodating for humans, and the
rest was almost more like a dog house than anything else. It's like those bird
houses that birds never use, but that people like to put up to pretend that
birds use. And I remember as she showed me this thing, she sat down, and she
was distracted by her phone the whole time, and she was gossiping about someone
with her friend, it seemed, and this gossip, I don't remember because I didn't
pay attention to it, but I remember thinking "typical" in the dream, like, this
is just typical for a girl her age to inturrupt what she wanted to show me
because this was so important that it couldn't wait, and it had to be taken
care of, and that which was so important that she had to show me could be put
on hold by whatever she was doing on her phone. So as she was doing this, I
looked into a box expecting it to be deep, but as I looked into the box, I
realized it was a sort of play box, and when she got off the phone, I rememeber
saying something like, "so does it have AC?" and she looked at my like "well of
course not silly" and she probably said something like that to me, and I
thought just about how quaint this life size doll house was, and I wanted to
venture inside, inside also being very shallow, but before I could do so I woke
up.

When I woke up, I had the first inclination that "surely I have not waken
before my alarm," and I had a moment of "well shit" because sometimes I have
the alarm in the other room, but I had distinctly remembered to bring it with
me as I changed rooms, but I was just waking so I was getting my bearings. And
as I checked, I found that it was indeed before my alarm, so I went back to
sleep, and let my alarm hit me at the correct points in rem sleep. This dream
was the sleep after my alarm and before I got up, and as I woke up, I remember
distinctly thinking, "I want to go back there" but then I remembered that my
alarm had gone off already, and that this was the one extra cycle of rapid
cycle sleep I allow myself, and I realized that I was just coming up with a
reason to go back to sleep when I should be awake. So I got up and started my
day.

Today, Paco showed me some stuff with a knife. I am still on the fence about
carrying a knife, but I am pretty convinced that I at least want to research
it, and at the very least own a knife. Whether I will carry it everywhere I go,
or just when I go out, or some other, I don't know, and I will certainly not
carry it in public until I feel rather comfortable with the trainer. I can see
myself playing with the trainer in my apartment for a long time before I feel
comfortable carrying in public. I will plan to research into that, and see what
I want my course of action to be.

So the last thing that is on my mind today, is I have not visited my father in
what is now almost exactly a week. It is strange. I really should have visited
on Saturday, but I didn't do that, and Sunday I thought about it again, but
didn't go again (mostly because I was really in the zone with literature and
everything else on sunday) and now I feel I should go, just because I am not
sure why. But at the same time, my last visit with him was so uneventful, that
I don't know if I should go, but I think I should. Surely there is something to
gain there?

I will say, I have noticed some resent still existing in me towards my parents.
I think that they are repentent a little bit, especially my father, but I don't
know about my mother. That's just a little note, and I don't really want to
dwell on it.

So yeah, I have still some time to continue writing for the rest of the hour,
and I'm not sure what to do with it. Usually I have something to write, but
today I don't as much. I could write about how I want to organize my note
taking scheme, but that I think has more to do with actually just writing the
note taking scheme than it does writing about it, so I will pass on that. I
feel a little inspired to go back and mark up the dragon and teh king, so I
might do that, a little later today, but I think I would prefer to use my
"free" hour on the note taking scheme.

I do want to talk about Russian for a second. So I think when it comes to
writing Russian, having all of the conjugations spread out like "here is a
stem, and here is how you can conjugate that stem" works for writing and
generating the Russian you want to say, but I want to do something sort of the
opposite. I want to be able to take a Russian word, and within it's context be
able to determine what sort of word it is. And this I think is more
interesting, because there is quite a bit of ambiguity in that, and that I
think is sort of cool. Like, I had this notion that any word which ends in an
hard consonent is a nominative Russian male noun, but looking at some of the
tables, it seems that female plural possessives will actually remove the
suffix, so a word that ends in a hard consonent could be a male nominative or a
female genitive plural. And there are a lot of things like this. So I want to
be able to get to the point where I can see Russian, and even though I might
not know what the words mean, I can say what functions they serve in the
sentence, and from that, I want to be able to start to get a better
understanding of how Russian is written. Then I can start trying my hand at
rearranging Russian sentences to say the same thing but in different ways. For
instance, in English, I could say, "the boy threw the dog a bone" and "Some boy
tossed a bone to the dog" which mean mostly the some thing, but they have
subtle differences, and I want to be able to acheive this level of subtlyty in
Russian. It's so cool, to be able to decline nouns to have them take different
parts in the sentence. I find it really a fascinating aspect of the Russian
langauge, and I am eager to explore it. On the one hand, getting all of
everything straightened out will be difficult, but I am feeling more and more
like just the act of straightening it out is helping me in bounds in
understanding how Russian is spoken and written, and how it is formed, and from
there I am not even concerned with vocabulary. In this puzzle of grammer, I
will be able to gleen words here and there, and as I start to gleen words in
this way, I will have to discover new words in order to "expand out the puzzle
and make it more interesting". Like, once I start getting bored with the
puzzle, I will have to expand my vocabulary to make the puzzle more
interesting, and in this way I can keep the whole thing interesting as I unpack
the puzzle. It's exciting.

So that is the next project for me to do, is to create a list of Russian
endings, and then all of the cooresponding ways that that ending could make a
Russian word. I want to be able to identify parts of sentences, first with
simple sentences, then with more complex one. It's exciting, and that will be
my goal from here.

Well, I have filled up the rest of my hours. I will plan now to get to actual
work with the rest of the thirty minutes I have before our meeting, and then
today is open mat, and then after lunch I will start to explore all of these
exciting things. I'm almost giddy with anticipation. There are so many exciting
things to do in this world and it always feels like there is never enough time
to do them. It's beautiful.

In fact, I could go on about this experince I had on top of the garage, but
that is for another day.

I also want to say that I plan to go to the writers meeting on Tuesday,
tomorrow, but I don't have much to say about that, and I need to stop. So this
is me stopping. Till next time.

# 20180723
So last night I had one of those dreams where I woke up and I was so excited
that I had a really good dream, but then I forgot it, and I thought it had
something to do with bowling, I had, "well sometimes you get to three strikes
and sometimes you don't" or something like that in my head, thinking that I had
forgotten the dream, and then it came back all in a flash, and I have no clue,
no conception of how I could have forgotten it, because it was a really good
dream. Not in a beautiful or pretty way, not like that at all, but instead
beautiful in just how involved it is. There is so much symbolism, and motifs,
and people I know in the dream, it's really fascinating to me. So let's just
get into it.

So this dream location is in my dream version of a giant skyscraper school
building. This building, I know at least the parking garage, has been the
location of many of my dreams in the past, but this building is a little off of
the parking garage. The parking garage is many levels, but in this dream I am
only on the floor level. And on the floor level, it opens up to the east, and
northeast is the building that is relevent to this dream. In this building is
what you would normally think of when you think of a generic skyscraper. There
are hallways, none of which are entirely straight, and in each of these
hallways there are doors, all having offices and classroom meeting places. The
particular room where this dream starts is on maybe the seventh floor, that
seems right (although later in the dream I forget the location, and that
becomes relevent) and the class room is composed of maybe twenty students,
which is about the capacity of the room, and the teacher is Jay. This dream has
a lot of work people in it. So Jay is teaching a class, and I don't remember on
what subject he is teaching, but he is teaching, and he is stumbling through
it, not teaching very well, and generally somewhat getting through the lecture,
but not really, and I remember having a moment where I was thinking "this is a
waste of my time, am I going to learn anything here?" and around that point we
are dismissed. So I go back down to the parking garage (and I don't remember
going down any stairs or anything, I'm not sure how I got back to the ground
level of the garage where my car was) and Eric comes up to me, and starts
making conversation. I remember saying something about the class, and how I'm
curious to see what will happen next week, and Eric sort of chuckles and says
"Let me let you in on something, there isn't going to be a class next week,
we're going to fire Jay." and he told me in the sort of way someone might tell
someone that they were planning on throwing their wife a surprise party. He
told me in a very matter of fact, hush hush, keep the secret sort of way.
Anyway, I said, is that so, and I wasn't sure how to react, and I might have
said something about Jay's inadecquecy in teaching, but I remember I got into
my car and drove back. Now, at this point in the dream, I don't remember
driving away, but I definitely remember driving back the next day, I'm not sure
what sort of dream magic happened to make that happen, but it's the next day,
and I drive back to the same spot in the garage, and as I start getting out of
my car (the interior of which I will describe in a bit) I start putting my
shoes on outside the car, and I start to panic a bit because I have forgotten
the location of the classroom. I remembered what it looked like, but I forgot
what floor it was on, so I had decided to go to the first floor that seemed
correct, and then wander from there. But this was all my thought, and I was
still putting my shoes on when I saw Eric again. Eric came up to me and I said,
"Oh good, I'm glad I ran into you, I've forgotten the floor to the classroom,
so I wanted to ask you which room it was in" and he said "That doesn't matter,
Jay is getting fired, don't you remember" and I said, "Yes I do, but I still
thought we would go to class." And Eric says, "No, in fact..." and he starts to
go on about the nature of Jay's firing, but before he can continue, he sees a
couple other classmates, (and I don't think they were alliant employees, but
just other dream people) and he goes off to tell them about the fact that Jay
has been fired. In fact, Eric is busy at work telling people all about the
news. Well, I get out of my car, and look around this garage. Like I said, the
garage opens up to the east, to the bushes and the greenways there, but this
garage is strange in that, on the inside of it, along the north wall, there is
an elevated area, and this elevated area has some stairways going up to it, and
it's seprated from the rest by full size glass walls, and the stairways lead up
to sliding glass doors, and inside this glass area is a sort of foyer almost,
but it's still in a parking garage so I don't want this to be all too fancy. In
fact, I remember a previous dream where this elevated glass area became the
subject of an action movie sequence for me, and I was the "good guy" and I was
fighting a bunch of bad guys, and this glass area became a point of tactical
position. Anyway, that dream was so many years ago, and I only bring that up to
say that, now in my waking moments, I remember this location as one that I have
had very explicitly in previous dreams. So after Eric goes off and begins
telling everyone else all the news he needs to tell them (and I want to make
note that he seems very excited about the whole thing, speaking in hurried
words and never finishing his sentences) I am left standing there, near my car,
and I look to my right to see this elevated area with the glass, and there I
see three people, two of them being Caitlin and Valerie (and the identity of
those two cannot be a coincidence, as will become evident later) and they are
standing there, shoulder to shoulder facing away from the wall, and then I look
up to the elevated area and I see someone else, I forget who, and I forget
exactly how they play in. But as I look up at the elevated area, a commotion
starts to play out, and there are some ruffians who are there to make some
trouble, they are ethnically black and half black, the sort of black people who
you look at and say "you are not entirely african, but you certainly identify
as black". Regardless, these ruffians start to make a ruccus at the top, and
then I realize that they are making a ruffus of the two girls standing at the
bottom, and I look back over to them, and the state of the ruccus is, they have
unclothed both of the girls, (Caitlin is closer to the elevated area, and
Valerie is further east more away from the glass), and they are turned almost
out of shame and maybe partly out of fear to (although there was not much
emotion on the girls faces that I remember, besides maybe the emotion of "i
froze up") but I looked towards the scene, and I remember I saw the ruffians
were discarding their clothes, and the girls were faced away, entirely naked,
and I saw there bare asses, both of them, and I looked at them, and I saw them
naked, and my first thought was, "I should do something" and immediately after
that thought, which was my instinctual thought, I had a thought that was
counter to that, which said, "they're naked, that's what you've been
fantasizing about" and I actually entertained the thought of just watching on,
because at this point the ruffians had not done any actual physical harm to the
girls, and my base sexuality just wanted to see them naked, that was the "goal"
for my sexual self, and I had acheived that goal. Well, I only entertained that
second thought for long enough to realize how absurd that notion was, and I
knew that certainly they would continue to rape the two girls there, and I knew
that I had to intervene, not for my sake, but for the girls. Indeed, I had no
intention of "winning them over" as is evident, because I intervened, and I
placed myself between the ruffians and the girls, facing the ruffians with the
girls at my back, and I made myself imposing, and puffed my chest, and got to
the point where I was very scared, because I did not know what sort of weapons
they might have, so I was trying to evaluate the situation as best I could, but
I was determined not to resort to fighting them unless it became absolutely
neccesary. That is, I wasn't scared of fighting any more than I was scared of
anything else, but rather I knew that the situation was unfavorable for me to
fight, and that by showing my intention to fight them, I could win the fight
without having to actually do any fighting. To be clear, I was wholly prepared
to fight, and the entire time was constantly both evaluating my opponents, both
of whom seemed pretty "street fighting" in their style (meaning they were
untrained, and were "trained by the streets" meaning they would have little
technique but a lot of spastic in them), and at the same time on edge to the
point where any false move by one of them, any move by them to compromise their
position and give me reason to fight them, I was ready to jump on that
advantage should I get approached. But they backed off, and at that point, I
looked back to the girls, who were still frozen there naked, to determine that
they were okay, and that was that. Well, whatever was going on up top, to my
right, up the stairs, through the glass sliding door, and on that elevated
area, there was a similar altercation going on there as well, but that one
resolved itself a little differently, I don't remember details about it, in
fact I might not even have details, but I remember out of that scene, Chris
Konkol came down through the doors, and I saw him, and he beckoned me to follow
him, as if he wanted to tell me something. So I follow him (and at this point
the girls have completely left my mind, they were safe and were none of my
business anymore, they could take care of themselves, and I was not concerned
for them any more) and he asks me if there is somewhere we can go to talk. I
mention that we could go to my car, which is just right there, and he says that
works, and Nick is there too, so we meet Nick, and I usher them in to my car.
Well, at this point there is something very strange going on that I don't know
how to describe. The inside of my car is an entire room, almost like the back
of a van would be. We walk into my car from the rear, and on both sides there
is a couch, and in the center there is a sort of pedastal, not a pedastal with
anything on it, but just a pedastal that is required there for the structural
stability of the car (it makes sense to me in the dream). So we get in, and
Chirs and Nick sit there in the car on the couch, and I sit across from them.
And they are sitting there, and they start talking almost between themselves,
with me there, about the firing of Jay, and it's meanings. And I remember
looking at Nick, and he was a woman, and I remember thinking, "he reminds me
very much of what I man would be like, what a strange woman he is" and that
thought was just that absurd. I even remember thinking, "Even Nick is the name
of a man, it's almost as if he is a man," but the figure I saw before me was a
woman, but not a pretty woman or anything, but almost what you would imagine a
male to female trans would look like, wearing a dress, but having scrawny
unattatractive legs come out of them, and wearing make up but having it not
make her appearence any better as a result. Well, I looked at this for a bit,
and I saw very much the actual Nick in her, but I did not dwell on that too
much, and I remember him (or her, I honestly don't know what to say) saying
something like, "I'm honestly not surprised, he was asking me the stupidest
question about Java the other day, it's a wonder he got so far as he did" or
something like that. And while we were there in the car, about five other
people came up to the trunk, and were standing outside (there was not enough
room for many more in the back of my car) and listening in on the conversation.

Well, this is about the time I woke up, and like I said, I forgot about the
dream entirely. Actually, I think I rememebered it, and was excited that I had
such an interesting dream, but I went back to sleep and had a dream about
bowling, a very mundane uninteresting dream, and when I woke from that dream, I
thought, "well, I know I had a profound dream, but sometimes you can't get all
three strikes" and I literally had a moment there where I thought about how I
could write about this bowling dream, but I knew that that wasn't it, and
something sparked my memory, "Jay getting fired" was the mantra I had to
remember this particular dream, and it came rushing back to me all at once,
like a light bulb had clicked on.

So that was the dream. There is a lot to unpack there. Jay getting fired, me
forgetting the room, Eric being excited to tell people, the scene with the two
girls and the ruffians, then the conversation with Konkol and female Nick, in
the back of my somehow large enough to fit the three of us on couches car. A
very fascinating dream.

# 20180725
So today I woke up and I didn't have any dreams. I actually do remember, I did
have some dreams, but they were rather fleeting and didn't represent themselves
to me in a way that I can particularly remember. So I won't bother to dwell on
it, thinking to hard on it is a sure fire way to ensure that I don't remember
it. It's good as well, because I have a couple things I want to write about,
and a dream would take up the entire session like it usually does, so that give
me time to write about other things.

So the two things I want to write about are this. First, I want to write about
my morning, because it was a very interesting morning. Second, I want to write
about my (very positive) experience at readysetwrite. I'm not sure which I want
to do first, so I will do the second thing first.

So yesterday, I finally decided to make the time to go to the Ready Set Write
meetup group that Nicolas had told me about. It was in Frisco, which I didn't
realize was so far from Irving. I thought it was just up the way, but really it
was a full twenty five miles up the way, so that was a bit unexpected for me.

The experince was good. First I went into the nerdvana restaurant, and I asked
them there if they knew about people who were a part of the ready set write
meetup, and they asked me if they met at the restaurant or the coffee shop, and
I said that it was probably the coffee shop, and so I went out and to the right
to the other building that was the coffee shop. After that whole thing, I
started looking around for people that looked like they were there for the
meetup, and I saw a couple of groups of people, and there was one set of women
who all had laptops out, and they seemed to me to be working on something, but
they seemed to already be immersed in what they were doing, and even though I
was precisely on time (and perhaps a couple of minutes late because of my
difficulty in finding the place exactly) I was not expecting them to have
already started. Also, I looked at the screen of one of the woman, and they had
some sort of powerpoint open, and from looking at it I deterined that these
women were probably not writing, but instead were most likely meeting about
something else. Right as I was then considering asking one of them if they knew
about ready set write, I decided to scan the rest of the room before I
inturrupted anyone, and I saw Nicolas sitting in the corner at one of the
tables there. He waved to me, so I walked over. We shook hands, then shared a
bro hug, and we started to catch up on things. We talked about when the last
time we talked was, and things like that, and in general just mostly caught up.
The topic then sort of went to what happened to me after college, and I alluded
to my trip to Seattle, and he mentioned that my grandparents had told him about
this, but I thought that he thought he was confusing me with someone else whose
grandparents were in Seattle and I thought that he thought that I had lived
with my grandparents for a time in Seattle, but we cleared up that confusion
pretty quick when he clarified, "No, when I visited your grandparents bayhouse
with Kyle, they told me about your trip to Seattle," to which I was actually
quite fascinated. I must have some sort of impact on them, because this is the
second time someone has told me something about myself that "they already knew"
even though I hadn't told them, because they had heard about it through my
grandparents. It's quite a fascinating thing, and I find it somewhat peculiar,
and interesting that it's happened now twice within the span of a month.

Regardless, after we had caught up a little bit, three more women showed up
there, one with a baby, and two others. Nicolas went over the procedure, of the
words that were there as the prompt, and they were very elementary words,
plant, ball, danger, and product, and from those we all set to our writing.

I have the writing saved, and I will plan to save them all of course as I write
them, because I plan to do this again, but mostly I just went off on the words,
and when I was done, I thought to myself, "how can I share this?" but I
eventually ended up sharing, and I shared the bit about the plant that runs a
ball plant, and the story of some nations that play a game with a ball that
comes from this plant.

Now, the last person to share, the woman with the baby, I could tell that she
had a foriegn accent, and I was perhaps hopeful that it was Russian, just
because I am learning Russian, but I wasn't too hopeful, and thought that it
was perhaps some other language like Finnish or Polish or something, because I
know that those accents can be similar, so I told myself not to be
presumptuous, and instead just go about the thing. Well, when she came to
share, she shared what she wrote, and she prefaced it with, "as you can hear,
english is not my first language, so I mostly just want to write to help
understand english better" something like that, and she shared her story about
a girl in Hawaii that gets a call from someone about a product, and the story
is about the adventures of this person, and she is so excited about it that
this person parties the night and sleeps through the alarm, and misses the
appointment, and that is sort of where it left off. But it was very well
written, and there was only a couple of moments where the grammer was off. So
when she was talking about that, how she mostly wants to get better at grammer,
and how she took classes but it is too expensive, and so she wants to meet
other people, and came upon this meetup, and she wants to use it to help
understand grammer better, the other people there talked about how Saturdays
might be more beneficial for her, as that's when people bring in their work for
critique rather than creation. And at that we mostly wrapped up the meeting.

Well, I got past my fear, and I walked up to her. I asked her name again, and I
said something like, "So you said you know Russian, and it just so happens, I
have been wanting to learn a foreign language, and about a month ago I just
decided that I should go ahead and pick one and learn, and it just so happens
that Russian is the language I decided to learn, so I was wondering if you
wanted to exchange, I could help you with english, and you could help me with
Russian." She said she would like that, and then I kind of went back and forth
about "maybe I'll see you Saturdays" but she said that wouldn't work because of
the baby, and she cannot stay at places long because she needs to take care of
the baby, and I said I understand, but then we landed on, her husband, he will
work late some evenings during the week, so she has the time to meet in the
evenings. I then said, that sounds great, and I then emphasized that I am
still very new to Russian, like all I know how to say is, "Я знаю... я не знаю
по-Русски" and she sort of chuckled and said "that's not bad" but of course I
know she was being nice, but still. I then said that it sounds great, and we
exchanged numbers, and I told her we would keep in touch. And I went home, and
when I got back to my apartment, I started making flash cards for the words I
"know" so far, and when I was looking up знаю the stress is on the а and not
the ю so I felt sort of silly saying it so backwards like I did to her, but of
course such a mistake is certain to happen.

So that was my experince there. I was dreadfully frightened going to sleep,
like "Oh my, I have really plunged myself into this whole Russian thing, I'm in
deep now, I really need to prepare something that is not so silly to prepare
myself for meeting with this woman, she will think I am dreadfully stupid" and
so on and so on, and I felt wholly unprepared for the whole thing as I was
going to bed. But I didn't think to much on it, I am exageratting my emotions
here as I am writing but really the emotion was more like, "Okay, I guess I'm
all in here, I'll have to prepare something" and I went to bed like that.

Well, and this is why I suppose I wanted to do it this way first, I woke up,
and when I woke up I instantly knew two things. The first was, I knew how I
wanted to place nouns on my flash cards, which was something of a relief to me,
because that was something I was thinking over, and the second thing was, I
knew how to approach the situation. I would come up with some sentences, after
I have finished my flash cards, and from these sentences, I would try and
create some sort of coherent story, or at least, not a story, but I want to
create sentences that I have questions about, and I want to say, "this is how I
would say something in Russian, and I am curious what sort of subtlties you
would add on to it." Something like that. So I could come up with a simple
sentence, and then add on to it in a very immature way, and from that build up
more complex sentences which would neccesarily be wrong, but that's the point,
because I want to see how complex ideas can be made from more simple ones, and
how that process is done in Russian. So I think that will be the plan. I will
continue to make flash cards, and from these flash cards I will make some
sample sentences, and build these sentences beyond my control, and ask her
about subtlties where I went "off the rails" so to speak.

All that to say, I am very glad I made this effort to make this exchange with
her, and I am very hopeful that, maybe once every two weeks, we can get
together and exchange language.

Something I will say as well, something that struck me very strongly about this
woman, is that she is a very kind hearted human being. Some of that might be
partly her upbringing, best I can tell she was certainly not privledged growing
up, but the innocence of her, it struck me. She also had such a way with her
child, her child was very well behaved, and such a thing, that strikes me as
also very noteworthy. It's a facet of something that I like.

I also want to say, in spite of my natural instinct to have these sorts of
thoughts, I very much want to have no intention on acting on the sexual tension
that her and I might feel. There is a sort of tension there, at least on my
sexually repressed end, and that tension is a function of my own, that I don't
want to act on at all costs. Women have such a strong way of mitigating that
tension, it's a feature of them that fascinates me, and in my interactions with
this woman, I hope to acquire that sort of womanly trait. That way, when there
is a healthy tension, I will know how to handle it.

I have managed to continue to abstain from marijuana and coffee as well. I want
to go off on a quick tangent here. So yesterday, I got a call from my lawyer,
Ben Hunsucker, and he informed me that I have been accepted into the First
offender program, which is good, and he told me that the first urinalisis that
I will have to take will be at the end of August, which if you can do the math,
means that I have a full month before the first time I have to pee in a cup.
Well, if you look at that, that means I could pretty safely smoke some
marijuana right now, and be entirely set for the uninalisis, and I even
entertained the idea for a brief fleeting moment.

Now I want to be clear here, I did not entertain it so far as actually getting
to the point where I said, "Fuck it, I'm doing it," and I thought about how it
would happen, and I decided that I didn't want it to happen like that. So
nothing happened. But the main reason is this. Marijuana has a lot more long
term benifits for me. I don't like smoking a lot of weed at once, that is not a
pleasureable experience for me, I much prefer smoking a little bit at a time,
and having some self restraint for it, especially in the mornings. I perhaps
indulge a little too much in the evenings, after work, but when there is BJJ,
or Yoga, or something else that I can go and "work off the high" with, I will
do that.

Regardless, the bottom line here is, it would not be in my best interest to
smoke any marijuana right now, for many reasons. Besides the obvious of "I
should not because the law determines it so" (which for me is the least of my
reasons), there is this fact that the one off smoking experience will only make
me want to crave more, along with the perhaps the most important aspect that I
have put myself on probation. The fruits of the tree of life are not ripe yet,
and to indulge in such a thing before it is ready, that would be the great fall
of man. Indeed, that's an interesting question. Was the fruit of the tree of
life ripe when Eve and Adam partook in the fall? I'm not sure, and I don't
know. Perhaps in my study of literature, I will discover this.

Which brings me to the rest of what I wanted to say (it's amazing how stream of
consciousness works). I woke up this morning, and checked the time, and
determined that I had another full REM cycle before I had to get up. As in, I
woke up at around 5:00, and I needed to be up at 6:30, as today is a training
day. But as I got up, I thought, I could have went into the other room and
watched some Hearthstone tournament which would sedate me to sleep, or I could
get on the piano. So after I finish reading a bit of Freud, I drank some water
and got on the piano, and I played, at an excruciating slow tempo, the Adagio
of Beethovens seventh sonata, the one in D major that reminds me of birds
disentigrating into nothing. Now, that movement, it's very immature, I would
say. There is a lot of yearning, a lot of sighing, a lot of diminished cords
that imply pondering, and anguish, and so on and so on, and I dare say that it
captures the immaturity very well. The entire sonata is such that, well, it's
sort of the anguish of a troubled teen, I would say, is what it reminds me of,
a troubled female teen, because it is a very female sonata to me. I'm not sure
what about it makes me say that, but that is my conception of it. But I had
wanted to play this movement very slowly, and I did and when I was done, I knew
that it was not worth my time learning this sonata like I have others. I would
be embarassed to play it in front of others.

So as I was done with that, I got up and walked around a bit, and I felt the
inclination to play some mozart after that. So I found my mozart book, and I
started playing some mozart before I realized that I had played for quite a
long time, and that I needed to get to training.

Something I thought about though, as I finished beethoven and before I moved to
mozart, was this. My analysis of music, I wanted to do it for so long, but I
had so many difficulties putting together in my head exactly how I wanted to
represent music, on top of the fact that I am not familiar with the output of
music to computer native formats. These sorts of difficulties are the same
sorts of difficulties I am encountering now with my lit analyzer, and with
that I thought to myself, "if I tried and gave up on my music analyzer (which I
haven't totally given up, but it is certainly don't have intentions to make it
happen like I used to), what's to say this project won't meet the same fate?"
To that I have one observation. I can create stories. Yes, they may not be very
good, and Dostoevsky is certainly a much greater author than I am and perhaps
ever will be, but I can create them, and be proud of them. Stories come to me,
I can discover them, I can write them down, and I know, certain aspects of the
stories have to be changed in certain ways to create different effects. And
yes, it might be the case that I am not the best at doing that, and I will
never be as good as I want to be, but that is in contrast to my musical
creativity. I am musially illiterate in comparison. I don't have that same sort
of curiousity, that intuition with music the same way that I do with words. I
can't read a score, and pick out all of the little things that I like about it,
and change around "I like this but I would have written it this way." and so on
in the same way that I do with novels.

I found this paralell between musical ideas and a novel. In a novel, the good
ones that I have been reading so far, characters are introduced even towards
the very end of the novel, so that in the final "movement" of the novel, an
entirely new character might be introduced that could be critical to the novel
as a whole. And this has been a grief I have had with music, that the motifs,
the characters, that get introduced towards the middle and end of a work, those
motifs I have grief with because "why are they introducing something new at
this point?" and I get lost and the impact of the music is lost on me. I feel
that, "it's not fundamental enough" and my engineer brain kicks in and says
that all of the motifs should be introduced at the beginning, and that the
exploration of them all should have a direct connection that I can easily
analyze. But when an author does it in a novel, I say to myself, "wow, what a
great effect that has, this character is introduced in such an organic way out
of the plot, and he adds such and such to the story." and I can even say what I
like about that character being introduced, and how I thought that it impacted
the work as a whole, and so on and so on. The point is, I enjoy such
complexities, and I see the motivation behind it being done, and the "greater
theme" behind the entire work I am able to "unpeel" from the plot and the
characters and everything, and I'm able to provide commentary about it, to say
what I like and dislike about it, and why I like or dislike it, suggesting what
I might have done differently had I been the author. 

But not so with music. When music does these things, I am not able to see the
"greater theme" of the music, and instead I am simply left to trust the
composer, to trust what he said, and what he wrote, and to take what he wrote
almost as a sort of scripture. It's hallowed, and it shouldn't be trifled with
or questions by a lowly mortal like me who has no idea how these things work.
Which is true, since I am that lowly mortal in the musical world, since I do
not have that intuition, I should not trifle with these things, and I should
trust those that do. At the same time, this attitude towards it, it suggests a
fine lack of understanding for what music means. A novel should not have a
goal, but instead should be discovered from the soul, and music does not come
from my soul. My soul is not bred out of music, I do not have a musical soul. I
have a musical mind, and I love the way music underlys so many things that we
do in life. But my soul does not express itself in music. It's sad, to come to
that realization, but I have always known it.

The question now becomes, in what way could I unlearn music to discover it in
my soul? What is neccesary for me to find my inner musical soul? I would need
to take lessons on music, from a great teacher. Who is such a teacher? I do not
know. So be it. Perhaps such a teacher will come by me some day, and I can give
them absurd amounts of money per hour, and through that I will discover the
music of my soul. But maybe not. I need to create, I need to improvise, and I
need to compose, but the medium to do that is so counter intuitive to what I
want. Writing a score by hand is tedious, and I certainly can not have a
musical idea and write it out by hand.

Singing is the only way I could do this. I could create a musical idea in my
head, and sing it. I have that sort of intuition. But I don't know what the
notes are. That's the rub. My ear is not in tune with that. So ear training I
think is probably a much bigger aspect to the whole thing. Ear training is the
crux of the issue. That is what I need to practice.

Surely there are online resources for ear training. That's an idea. Train the
ear, reproduce the notes. Then, when I hear something in my head, the notes
would come out in their form, just like when I hear something with my ear, the
same thing happens. Such a great notion.

That would certainly be the start to developing a musical soul. But it would
take so much effort. I want to develop my lyical soul first. I want to learn
Russian, I want to create my "Lit analyzer suite". I will do those things
before I go back to music. I will surely go back to music in my life, but in
what way, I don't know.

# 20180726
So this is a rather strange article to start. I have so many things to write
about last nights dream, about what just happened, about my meditation waking
up, I don't know where to start because I'm afraid I'm going to miss pieces and
then they will be gone forever.

Well, lets start and work backwards. Today, as I was walking in to work, just
twenty minutes ago, I saw Kaley in front of me. She was the topic of the second
dream I had, and so as I was walking, she was quite a good bit in front of me,
and she held the door for me, like, she started to walk in, but she looked back
and saw me there, and she waited for quite a good while to hold the door. And
then she started talking to me. She told me about how excited she was to be
going to Mexico this weekend, she is taking a long weekend, and she is using it
to go to Mexico. And she was talking about these things, and I replied that it
sounded fun, being cordial, but when we got to the stairs, I just turned off
and went up, and sort of cut off the conversation. And as I got into the
stairs, I started saying to myself, like, what the actual fuck. Like, what the
actual fuck. I have a dream, where she is in it, and she is a pretty central
part to the dream, and it's explicitly her in the dream, and in the dream we
were talking about things, and now like magic, the very next morning, we have a
conversation so much like the one in the dream, not the same for sure, but very
similar, with similar sort of mood, the spirit of the conversation was the
same, her talking and me listening, and I cut it off before it was done, I cut
it off, similar to how my parents cut it off. I was blown back by this event,
as I walked by the stairs, I couldn't help but feel completely amazed and
astonished that such a thing would happen, I don't understand it at all. And of
course, there are two main "silly" interpretations to this, the first being
that dreams are divine and that there was divine intervention at play here, but
taht is silly, but the coincidence of the whole thing is wholly remarkable. I
don't know what to make of it. I felt a little bad for cutting her off by going
into the staircase, but I always take the stairs, and well, I have made the
decision earlier on that I won't change that for someone else, and that I will
not let social stigmas bother me. I was slightly bothered by my rude treatment,
I literally just walked into the stairs, and I would have like to continue the
conversation, but it didn't happen like that. Fuck me, I wish I understood what
this means. Oh, and the second interpretation, comperably as invalid as the
divine, is that my subconscious mind knew that this sort of event would happen
today, and my dream was simply the inevitable knowing that this sort of event
would happen. But I don't understand what it means. I am not interested in
Kaley, and though she is physically what most anyone would call attractive, she
is, as I said in the dream, a ditz, and I believe that. Now, to say that I
couldn't date a ditz is one thing, and perhaps that would be the best sort of
person for me to date, and maybe my brain knows that, but there has to be some
sort of equality to some extent, there has to be some sort of mutual
appreciation of the subconscious and the conscious phenomenon, and I have to be
able to discuss that with a potential mate. But I digress. There must be some
sort of repressed feelings, in fact, I know there are, between Kaley and I, and
I have an affection for her in a strange way. She is so unlike what I consider
an ideal human, but I love her for that anyway. Love is a strong word here, but
hopefully the reader understands what I mean by love. I love all things, and
Kaley is one of those things that I see a lot of a certain specturm of love
for. She has a very feminine way of conversation, and of doing things, it's
interesting.

Okay, so enough of that, that happened just this morning and I still don't know
what to make of it. When I woke up today, I looked outside and saw that it was
light, and like I said, I had these two dreams, both of which had a pretty
profound impact on my psyche, and I mostly sort of layed there, realizing that
I probably wasn't going back to sleep, and playing through both of the dreams
in my head, going over them again and again, because I so very much did not
want to forget them. Eventually, after about twenty minutes of laying there,
when my watch alarm went off in the other room, I got up, grabbed my phone and
recorded the dreams in voice on my phone. The telling of both those dreams took
me about 20 minutes. I could transcribe what I wrote here, but instead of doing
that, I will elect to write through them again, because there were a lot of
details to these dreams that are important to me, and these two dreams I want
to have written down for sure in as complete a way that I can. They are so
profound, and the second one in particular had such a huge impact on me, on top
of this incident with Kaley this morning, it's hard for me to take it in.
"There is so much beauty in the world, it's overwhelming, I can't take it in".

After I recorded the dreams, I put some lounge clothes on and went outside to
meditate. I went to my favorite meditation spot, but this time instead of
sitting at the top of the hill, I went to the bottom, at the shore of the lake,
and I meditated there. I went through a lot of things during that session, and
it was a good reset button for me. Before the meditation, I had the inclination
to act on all of my base desires, my base instincts, after those two dreams, I
wanted to declare things to people and to make things known to them, but after
the meditation, I reset, and I came back to myself. I felt my own body again,
and I stepped out of the dream world of my imagination. Meditation is
important, and I will make an effort to practice some more.

So enough of that, let's get to these dreams. In this case, now, instead of
working backward through the day as I have been, I will place the two dreams in
order, because that is the way they should go.

So both of the dreams happened in the dream version of my parents house, which
as I've said before, is laid out in an identical way to the real version of my
parents house. In fact, this dream version was so much like my parents actual
house, that calling it the dream version would be unneccassary, and you could
just say that it was taking place in my parents house. Still, there were some
details about various furniture and things that were like my parents house when
I was a kid more than things are arranged now, so that is different, but for
the most part it's exactly like my parents house. So the first dream begins,
and I am in our schoolroom. This room is probably the least like anything that
the schoolroom has ever been, it was mostly empty, and there were some sitting
areas on the back wall next to the window.

(A breif aside here, Caitlin just messaged me asking me to look into something,
and she hasn't done that in multiple weeks. What the actual fuck is happening)

(I will resume this after I look into this, hopefully it shouldn't take too
long.)

There are four main scenes, I invoke the demon, I encounter the demon in the
study, the demon swallows us all, I reflect on the demon in the backyard, and
then I capture the demon, then the epilogue, where the demon jumps out of the
closet, and I hold it.

The second dream, the outline goes, I host a party, I talk with someone in the
kitchen (I forget that part at the moment) I talk with Kaley in the chair, my
parents wake up, I storm through the house, I drive off.

God, fuck me, I am getting so discombobulated by this issue, Caitlin always has
the most obscure issues that deal with the most obscure shit, and I don't want
to deal with it right now. I want to write out my dream, but I can't fucking do
that in peace. I have some consolation that I have the dream spoken out on my
phone, and that version you could say is pretty raw, but I want to have an hour
of uninterupted writing, and now I'm just sitting here like an asshole waiting
for Caitlin to answer my damn question about her issue.

I'm about to lose my fucking cool with Caitlin, this is so interesting. Like,
this dream is seriously having a profound effect on me. I'm going to go outside
and scream when I'm done with her.

Okay, I'm back, and I'm better. I have solved Caitlin's problem, (and fuck the
way canadian taxes are handled in Alliant, like fucking seriously) and I came
back from BJJ.

I want to go back into my dreams, as I am afraid the magnitude of them is
escaping me, but I can't quite get back into that mode at the present, so
instead I want to talk about my experience with Skyler today. Skyler is a
beautiful soul. I love him. He is a wonderful human being. I was the only one
to show up today at lunch class, and he was teaching, so I got what was
essentially a private lesson from him. We played with that Kimura grip, and the
whip around to the back, and then also two other things you can do based upon
how people react to that kimura grip. It's classic Skyler stuff. More, what I
want to write about him, is after we were done, and we began talking about
stuff, he asked me what I do for work, and I told him that I am a software dev.
And he started asking about everything. He mentioned that he wanted to get into
it, but he wasn't sure the right avenue for that sort of thing, and we talked
about that some, and I asked him what he does, and he mentioned that he did
training at the four season, as well as some customer service type positions,
and other things, and that he wanted to "get into programming" and asked what
my opinion on the best way to do it. Well, I said that I wasn't the best person
to ask there, and he asked me how I got into it, and if there was a learning
curve for me, and I said that no, there wasn't a learning curve for me, that I
was always facsicanted with the maths and sciences, and programming was sort of
a natural extension of that interest. Regardless, we talked for a bit more, and
eventually we parted ways, and I made it back to work.

But here is the thing. I was entirely over my anger after this "private lesson"
with Skyler. It's an amazing thing, that people like this can have on the soul.
Part of it is my attitude towards life. Being a perpetually hot-headed child,
and giving myself in to that path of nihilism for so long as I did, and being
blessed enough to see it to it's inevitable conclusion, and then being able to
claw and climb my way back out of it, and continue to work on a better way of
living, all of that has given me an aptitude for recognizing these moods in
myself, and knowing at least intellectually, even when the emotions want to
take control, that those routes are not healthy to go down.

I have not been that upset in a very long time. It's been a very long time that
I've been so upset that I have to excuse myself from a situation and take some
breathes. Part of it was my desire to write out these dreams, and the
inturruption by Caitlin with this tax issue gave me a sort of denial. Like, I
wanted it to be an easy issue so I could go back to the dreams, but looking
into it for just a bit, it was clearly not, and my frustration generated from
my dream, compounded by the fact that I couldn't even write about the dreams
without being inturrupted, it created such a strange effect, that I have felt
before, but that I thought I had matured past, but clearly I have not.

Regardless, let's get back to the dreams. So as I was saying before I was
inturrupted, this first part of the first dream, it started in the school room.
And as I said, the schoolroom was the room in the house that was the most
unlike any iteration of the school room that it has ever been. And I remember,
the first thing that I wanted to do was to let out this demon. Now, this is the
interesting thing about this dream. As I was letting out the demon, or rather,
as I was deciding to do so, I knew what the demon was, what it was like, and
what it would do, and I knew how the dream would go from there, for the most
part. It was like I was putting in a movie, and I knew the subject of the
movie, and I knew how the movie ended, but I wanted to watch the movie again
anyway. And that is how this demon was summoned. I took a book, and I opened
it, and out of it came the demon.

I will now do my best to describe the demon. I have, even still, a pretty clear
vision in my head of what the demon looks like, and I will do my best to do it
justice. So the demon was knee height to me. It had two hind legs, and two
distinct arms, somewhat in proportion to human limbs, but the demon was
equipped to run on it's four limbs. It was most like a lemur, now that I am
able to come up with an animal. I think a lemur is the best analogy for this
demon, at least as far as body dimensions go.

Now, the demon had fur. It had hair, also like a lemur, and it had mostly black
fur, except it had some patterns of white fur amongst the black fur. I am
trying to remember exactly where the white patterns were on the demon, but my
imagination is interfering with my memory right now, and I don't think I will
be able to get it. The key point here is, the demon had a very pale face, a
very human like face. The face was in proportion to the rest of it's body, but
it was like a wrinkly old man. It reminds me a bit of those books that have a
face coming out of them in the movies, kind of similar to that, but very
sinister, and way more animate than that. And none of these things seemed out
of place, the way I am describing them makes it sound like "a lemur with a
human face, how funny that would look" but if I had skills with drawing, I
could draw it, and it would not look funny, but instead it would be something
natural. To talk about its face, I imagine the best way to describe it would be
as the old wise monkey sage that exists in monkey movies, with the hair in
appropiate sagely places on the face of the monkey, but this would be a younger
version of that sage, very alive, and very animate. That is the best I can do
without dwelling on it longer.

Something also, this demon had a tail. This tail was not like a lemur tail, but
instead was shaped like one would expect a demon tail to be shaped. It wriggled
like a snake, and had an arrowhead like ending on the end. It was pitch black,
and was stiff, like a wire. If one were to grab the tail, I could garuntee you
that it would create an extreme reaction out of the demon, and nothing good
would come of it.

To talk a little bit about the personality of this demon, it was a very
playful, and sly demon. As you will see as I describe the dream, the demon is
verying cunning with his words, but at the same time he is very playful. He
likes to joke and play with his prey, and the whole thing is like a fun game to
him.

So I let out the demon. I must remind you, that I was not doing this for any
reason other than "to watch a familiar movie again". As in, I knew how to re
capture the demon, and that was with the image of a girl bouncing a ball
robotically up and down, which I will describe in it's proper place, and I was
more doing this out of intention to let the demon free, and let what happens
happen, rather than for any other reason.

In fact, it is very difficult to describe my exact motivations by what they
were. I think this is the case because I had no motivations to open the demon.
It was just something that came to me as something that I wanted to do, similar
to how one could say "I want to watch Movie X" and place movie X into the
player, and watch it for the next two hours. That person might have seen that
movie before, and they know how it ends, but for whatever reason, they just
decided, "I want to watch that movie right now," so they put it in and watch
it. It was the same for me with this demon. I sort of just decided, without
dwelling on it or having any real reason, that I wanted to summon this demon,
and I knew how to capture the demon once it was out, and I knew the personality
of this demon, but similar to how someone watching a familiar movie might see
something or have some effect to their psyche after they watch a movie again, I
had similar sorts of effects on me.

I have not ever explored this demon in dreams before, and the notion that I
knew this demon and what he was about and what he would do and how to recapture
him was one that was isolated to this particular dream experince. How I knew
these things or where they come from I do not know.

So after the demon was summoned, I summoned it by openning this book, and the
book open, and there was a bit of a dramatic entrance by the demon. The image I
remember from the dream is of a lifeless body of the demon coming out from a
sort of smoke and light show coming from the book, a very dark smoke and light
show, not overly dramatic, and not accompanied by any sort of music other than
the sounds of smoke and light, whatever those sounds are. And out of the smoke,
there was this lifeless statue of a demon, almost like it were a pelt, a
stuffed animal, that one would have proped up in their room if they were a
lemur hunter. Well, this lifeless state only lasted for a breif moment, and
before the smoke could even clear, life instantly sprang into the demon, and it
very breifly looked around before it laughed and scurried off on all fours. And
when it scurried off, I immediately left the room and went into the kitchen
where my parents were.

When I made it to the kitchen, I made them aware of what was happening. I told
them, "Listen, just so you know, I have summoned a demon, so be careful." And
they had a sort of indifference to it. It wasn't that they couldn't be bothered
by it, or that they weren't afraid of it, but they more brushed the topic away,
almost as if to say (although they did not really explicitly say anything)
okay, well, thanks for letting us know, and why did you do that, and I assume
you're going to take care of it. And they said all of that with their body
language, with the way that they continued on sitting at the kitchen table, and
continued on with their business. I have not totally captured their meaning,
but I think that's about the best I can do. So I then mentioned that I am
pretty sure the demon is in the study, and they said, "okay, we'll be here,
thanks for letting us know" in that same sort of way that I described, and so I
made my way, after letting them know about the demon, into the study.

I wish I could recall exactactly what happened in the study. I went in to the
study, and mostly what I remember was looking around at all the corners of the
room, mostly the ceiling corners, looking for the demon. And I remember getting
glimpses of it, but it was definitely scurring around the room, and it was able
to hide itself behind the different furniture and things in the room, and it
was constantly escaping behind furniture, and then coming back into my view.

Now, this is the point that I don't remember. I know we exchanged words back
and forth, but I don't remember what the words were, or what they were related
to. I might listen back to my recording of this whole thing and see if there is
any insight there, but I don't want to do that right now. The biggest thing I
rememebr is that the demon was playing a sort of hide and seek, and I kept
trying to find it, but it kept appearing in the places I wasn't looking, and
when I would redirect myself to look where I saw it, it would manage to scurry
around again and appear in another unexpected place. It was toying with me, and
it was being very playful when it was doing so. You can imagine a scene in a
horror movie where the bad guy is saying "come out come out wherever you are"
to the protaganist who is looking for them.

Anyway, the demon eventually reveals itself to me, and I do remember that it
startled me a bit, sort of like a jump scare, but in a different way, like I
knew he was going to reveal himself to me, I just didn't know when. I do
remember being quite scared and apprehensive to do anything. I remember there
was the scene then, after he had reveal himself, he was trying to swallow me,
and I had managed to avoid his swallow, and he stood almost with a sinster
laugh in the middle of the study, and I knew that trying to confront it was not
the proper thing to do, and I determined that this little game we were playing
was done, and that it was time to go back into the kitchen.

So I exit the study, and I go into the kitchen, where my dad is actually in the
seat my mom usually sits in, and my mom is in Evan's spot. There is no
significance to this, as we would often sit in the "wrong spot," when it's not
dinner time, and this is what they were doing now, they were just sitting in
the spot that was most convienient to sit.

So I exit the study, and observe the demon sort brooding in the study there,
and I knew it was going to give chase to me. So I go back into the kitchen, and
as I come out, I give my parents the update, "Okay, so I have found the demon,
it was definitely in the study, and now it is giving chase to me." and my mom
in particular was really scared, especially when the demon came out somewhat
menecingly, at least, menecingly to our vision, it was just the way the demon
walked to the demon, but regardless, it came out and stood there looking at us,
still being playful, but this time instead of being deceptive, it was sort of
just brooding there, and even making some faces that you could call funny
faces, not silly faces, but faces that in others contexts might be considered
funny. And I remember my mom being scared, like, "look at that, what are you
going to do with that thing, it's going to swallow you!" And I said, no, look,
it is warded off by my attachment to my father.

And this is the part of the dream that I find the most profound, (well, there
is a lot about this dream that is profound, but this is one of the profound
things that I don't fully understand yet). What I did, I noticed taht my mom
was right, and that the demon was preparing to pounce, but I noticed this, and
I began hugging my father, almost embracing him, from the side, covering his
arms with my embrace, it was not a mutual embrace, but more the embrace of a
child who clings to his father. And my father, I remember, was still there, and
he just sort of sat there, like he wasn't sure what I was doing, but since it
seemed to be working, he decided to just sort of sit there.

And that did in fact ward the demon off. It was still ready to pounce, but it
was very noticable that it became apprehensive at my embrace of my father. And
we were safe from it for that breif time.

However, this was ruined just moments later by my mother. She immedietly, as
soon as she realized that the demon was benig warded off ran to us, to embrace
myself and my father together. She surely did this with the intention of "being
safe with us" but I knew this was the wrong thing to do, and as I saw her
running to us, I said "No don't, it will just swallow all of us if you do
that," but she ran to us anyway, and embraced me around my father.

Well, as soon as she was embraced with us, the demon grew extremely large.
Rather, I should say that it's mouth became extremely large, it's mouth began
to open, and until it turned into something that wasn't even like a mouth, it
was more like a funnel, a funnel that, when you looked into it, led into
something akin to infinite darkness. Now, if one were to have looked at this
from the side, looking at it from an entirely emperical point of view, this
mouth was indeed like a giant funnel coming out of the place where the mouth of
the demon should be, but looking into it, it was like the entire thing was not
part of the demon, but instead part of some infinite darkness. It did not lead
to anywhere except darkness. Eternal darkness. And so this demon opened up it's
mouth in this way, and it became very large. I would say that the opening was
about 7 feet in diameter, so it stretched from the floor almost all the way up
to the ceiling, but not quite. It was taller than all of us for sure. And
attached to this newly openend darkness, was the demon, and it was pouncing on
us, and it came up over us, with the funnel of it's newly opened mouth pointed
downward, and it came down onto, over us, and engulfed us in darkness, for a
breif moment.

As soon as all of this happened, I did not have time do anything, but as soon
as it began to engulf us, I disattached from both my mother and my father. I
looked to both of them, particularly my mother, and I explained to her, "when
it was just me and dad, the demon could not get us all, but when you joined, it
could get all of us, did you not see that?" and my mom just looked back at me
sort of dumbfounded.

Let me clarify at this point exactly what happened so that it is clear when I
read it back. The demon engulfed us in the darkness, but before it could I let
go. When I let go, the darkness dissappeared, and the demon was gone as well,
but I knew that the demon was still around. So it was sort of in that darkness
that the demon was able to escape from us. It's something that doesn't make
sense if you were watching the scene from the outside. From the outside, it's
unknown whether the demon went poof, or whether it put the darkness over our
eyes. I'd say the best way to describe it form the outside would be that the
mouth/darkness funnel came over us, and fell all the way through us, and it
looked as though the demon went through the ground. But that's not what
happened. That's just the best way to describe it. Really what happened is that
the demon engulfed us in darkness, and I was able to deny our full engulfing by
removing myself from my parents, and the demon had managed to scurry completely
out of sight of all of us in that moment of darkness that we had. In fact, it
almost did feel like the demon "went through us" and into the ground below, but
I again must emphasize that that is not what happened, and just that it is the
best way I have to describe what really happened.

So I knew I had to act fast. After my breif exchange with my mother, I knew
that I had to capture the demon again. And I was comforted with the fact that I
knew how to do it. But at this point I knew that I had to reflect on it, to
make sure that both I knew how to capture it, and that capturing it was the
best thing to do, so I went outside, through the living room, out our back
door, and into our backyard.

Now, the backyard was still also very much like the actual backyard of my
parents place, but the swing set was still there. That swing set was only
removed a couple of years ago irl, but in the dream, the swing set was still
there.

So I went outside, and I walked onto our porch, and went to the right towards
tho swingset. The swingset was there, it was a square frame, with legs on each
side, and I was facing the opening of it. On the other side of the swingset is
our fence, the fence to our backyard. In between the swing set and the fence,
the demon stood there. It was not moving, it was standing on its two hind legs,
and it had its hands crossed in front of itself, similar to how someone
standing might rest their hands in front of themselves and it's head was bowed
down towards the ground, as if it were waiting for something there. I walked up
to the swingset, but I did not go through it, I went right up to it, but I knew
that I shouldn't go through it. I stood there, and I looked at the demon, and
at that point, I reflected. I was very calm at this point. I reflected on the
demon, on it's nature, on what it was, and I reflected on how to capture it. At
this point, I got a very clear vision, (a vision within a dream, how strange a
thing) of the girl bouncing the ball, up and down mechanically, and I knew that
this girl was what would capture the demon. I then looked at the demon, and I
stared at it, trying to gauge it's intentions, and I knew that he was almost
trying to coerce me, to tempt me, to walk under the swingset. And I will say, I
was drawn to walk under the swingset, with the notion that, "the supersition of
walking under the swingset is silly" but I knew that it was more than just
superstition telling me to not walk under the swingset, so I denied my
rebellious attitude in that moment, and I went back inside.

I knew where I had to go. I went back to the school room, and near the book,
the book I had used to summon, I found a doll. This doll was like a rag doll,
that they sell, not like a barbie, but very much a girl doll. With this doll,
there was also a ball that I found.

Now at this point, as I was gathering the doll and the ball, and I was
arranging them in the way that they needed to be arranged, the demon had
followed me, and was standing outside the doorway to the school room. I just
now put together, that at this point, the demon was always standing on the
other sides of doorways, and almost as if it could not cross them, and was
staring at me and almost trying to entice me to do so.

Anyway, with the demon standing there (and this time I was not at all enticed
to cross the doorway to the demon, I was too focused on the doll and the ball)
I placed doll standing up on it's feet on top of a small piece of wood, and I
raised up its right arm to be parallel to the floor, and under it's right hand
I placed the ball. I dropped the ball and it hit the wood and bounced back up,
and with my other hand, I moved the hand of the doll up and down to keep the
ball bouncing, almost as though I was playing with the doll, and almost as if
it was the doll that was bouncing the ball like a basketball. After only a
couple of bounces, the doll started perpetuating the bounces on it's own. This
doll was like the scene in a wrinkle in time, where all of the girls are
controlled by the overmind thing or whatever, and they are all bouncing balls
in unison with eachother, with a extreme amount of roboticism, but in this case
it was a doll, and it was just one of them, and I started the motion of the
bouncing and the doll continued it when I let go.

When I let go, something I didn't quite expect happened. The result I expected,
but the way that it happened I didn't expect. I was look at this whole thing
with a sort of curiosity, and as I was watching the doll bounce the ball, I
noticed that the doll got larger and larger, as did the ball it was bouncing,
but it was doing so in a very uniform way, and the mechanicalness or roboticsm
of the way it was bouncing the ball didn't change. But as the doll got larger,
it became less and less doll like, less ragdoll like that is and more "lifelike
doll" like if that makes any sense, and the demon, the lemur there, who was
staring at the ground to the school room, and he as completely still, and still
life like, but as the doll got bigger, and less ragdolly, the demon started to
become slightly smaller (remember it is a small demon, about knee height to
begin with) and more and more ragdolly, and by the time the doll reached it's
full height, the demon had become a complete ragdoll, to the point that I knew
that it had lost all of it's abilities to be lifelike at all. The "soul" of the
demon was still in the ragdoll, though, but it's ability to do anything in the
world was trapped.

So at this point, when the demon had fully transformed, I crossed the door to
the demon, and I picked it up, and I looked at it. I took it, along with the
book, the doll, and the ball, and took them all into the closet, and I put the
book away with the doll and the ball, but the demon I still had in my hand, I
as I started to put it away, I knew that it was not wise to hide it in the
closet with these other things.

At this point, as I'm putting all of these things away, my parents came into
the school room, on the other side of teh doorway between the closet (which
this school room closet in the dream was like a walk in closet, which is unlike
IRL) and I heard my mom say, "why are you keeping that ragdoll, just put it
with the other things and keep it in that closet." I knew that that was wrong,
but I put the doll there with the other things, because I knew that it was not
going to do any harm in the immediate, and I had the very strong intention to
go back and grab it.

Well, I did not put the demon ragdoll fully away, but instead left it in the
box with the other things sort of like it was sitting on the edge of the box,
and I walked back into the room.

And I said to my parents, who were both there "I think it is wrong to hide that
demon there, I think I should keep it" and my mom again said, "Why would you do
that, why would you keep such a thing as that, just be rid of it, keep it
hidden in the closet" and as she said that, the ragdoll demon came flying out
of the closet as if it were catapulted. Now, I want to clarify, there is not a
catapult in the closet, and the demon had not "regained it's ability to move"
as in, the demon itself did not propel itself on it's own. But still, however
this happened, it happened, and the demon came flying out of the closet in an
arch, and it landed at my feet, literelly to the point where I could just pick
it up, and hold it. So I picked it up, and I said, "see, it should not be
hidden away, it should be held out like this where everyone can see it." and I
gripped the demon ragdoll by the waist, and held it out for my parents to see.

That was the ending of that dream. Whether or not it goes into the next dream
fluidly, would actually make some sense. I do not remember waking up at all in
the middle of the night, but these dreams were definitely seperated by a rem
cycle for sure. In fact, I can say with confidence that this dream does not
lead into the next one, as my parents in this dream
