So this  is a story all about how my life got twist turned upside down and I'd
like to take a minute just sit right there I'll tell youa all about how I
became the fresh prince of bel air.

So for real though, what I want to be able to do is take my stream of
conscousness and transmit it directly onto this machine. That way, I can do
things like write blogs and journal articles and diary entries and all sorts of
stuff. and not have to thkni about what is going on beneath my fingers. So
yeah, when I g et to that point, it will be a good day, I can feel as though I
am getting close to that point, but it is really just a meter of time before I
totally get there. It's difficult to do, and it takkes a lot of practice. I lke
doing it though, it's just a matter of doing so in a way where I stay
comfortable.. I will say, I do not lke the way this keyboard I am uisng is so
slanted to the left. I want to get a 69% keyboard at some point, but I haven't
done my research on twhere to find them and how much they cost and cet etc. .

Regardless, there are a few things I want to say, The first thing is that I
think Ros Namajunes is one of the most gorgeous individuals I have ever met.
Like, absolutely stunning individual. It's absurd really. And I mean that in
the least sexual way possible. In fact, I would go so far te say that my
thoughts about rose are such that I would remove any feeling of sex about her
because that really obscures the kind of human being she is. She is so beautful
in so many ways, it's quite amazing to be honest.

To start, she is an amazing fighter. She cut her hair for practicality reasons,
she doesn't wear heels because it doesn't make sense for her to, she wears
loose pants and comfortable shooes.Everything about her is absolutely spot on.
She has the most genuine heart, the strongest soul of any individual I have
seen, and speaks with the most sincerity for herself and the poule around her
and the human race as a whole. I am absolutely blown away by her heart and her
soul, and her mind, and her body. Everything about this human being is
stunning. 

That only scatches the surface too. She eembodies everything that is good in
the world, and her charcter is what everyone should be actively seeking every
day to what she seekxs. It's in that constant search for the best version of
ourselves that we find the best version of ourselves. But only for glimpses.
The window into the soul is always dynamic, and one should always understand
how that window lies in with reality.

So I am getting to a point in my life where I feel like my life is becoming a
really interesting story, a story that will be worth telling in perhaps
autobiographical format at some point. However, and this is a difficulty that I
have had in the past with my tale of Delita, and that is my memory of things is
not quite clear on certain details of the story that can sometimes be very
relevent to how things play out. And even if my memory is totally correct, the
act of actively trying to conjure up memories of things that happened even just
two years in the past is proving to be difficult, and one can only imagine that
conjuring up memories like this is sure to have so hindsight 20 20 glasses
going on, so this is my attempt to acheive a few things.

One, I want to write more. I have just gotten to the point where I can think
words in dvorak and they come out onto my fingers in pretty quick pace, so I
want to harness that and really make my typing ability become ingrained into my
subconscious so that I can really reap the benefits of switching keyboard
layouts. On top of that, I want to get used to the idea of writing down things
that might seem very long or very perhaps even cumbersome, but when read back
don't take very long to read. That is something I have noticed is that, when I
write, I write in very consice thoughts, and I'm afriad to venture to far on
tangents because when you write a tangent, it seems like you are on that
tangent for a very long time because writing take a very long time to do in
comparison to thinking or reading, but when you read it back it feels
disjointed because I don't stay on those tangents for very long, and the reader
is left to wonder why the writer is constanly cutting all of his tangents
short. It makes it seem as though I want to say something but that I am
constantly going back to the thing I stemmed from, which, like I said, creates
very disjointed and disorienting writing.

The second, is that I want to remember these things, my feelings, emotions,
thoughts, and etc, as they are still fresh in my memory. This journal is not
intended as a thereputic tool (although, surely it can be used as such in
certain times, and any journal and writing in general is always in a way
thereputic) but instead as a reflective one, a tool I can use to create a sort
of imprint of my emotions, of my actions, and of the events that happen to me
and those around me. I want this to be a sort of picture, a video of my life,
but this is better than a video because the reader consuming this medium has
access to the inner thoughts and emotions that go on inside of my head, where
as a consumer of video would have to infer that from the video being watched.
In a way, it is worse because the truth can be distorted through the lens of my
writing, but I will do my best to keep this metaphorical mirror as flat and
clean as possible, perhaps even making note of the places where the mirror may
be smudged or distorted so that the reader will know when something that is
being written is my perception of the truth rather than the raw unfiltered
facts of what happened.

So all of that out of the way, this first article will be a bit of a doozy, and
will be uncharacteristic of what I want this to be. What I want this to be is
my thoughts and emotions of the events of the day before, written in the
morning of the following day, in a way that puts the context of the day before
into my philosophical musings of this current day. However, I feel it neccesary
to start today with a whole background of what has happened to me over the past
8 months, since the day I got that phone call from my mother that my father was
diagonosed with Luekemia. But then that goes against the spirit of what I just
said, as if I went over that past 8 months, I would be conjuring up feelings
and emotions over those 8 months rather than reflecting on my current thoughts
and feelings of what is going on right now, so I am left in a bit of a quandry.
I think the best way to resolve this is to simply start at the start where I am
right now, and to go over the background of other things in my life before this
journal was started as they seem appropiate. So let's do that.

So I am currently section 2 part 1 chapter 1 of "The Brothers Karamazov".
Currently I have two translations of that novel by, one being the etext version
that I make annotiations in, translated by Constance Garrett, and the other is
the "everyman edition" or some such, that I bought at the store some weeks ago,
and is another translation by two individuals who I forget their names at the
moment. I have also just recently, this past weekend (so 4 days ago now) bought
a tablet to read on, and I have been reading on this tablet for the past few
days now, and I am liking that method quite a lot.

All of that preface to say, the themes and motivations of those characters, and
the events that happen to them, greatly remind me a lot of the various aspects
of myself. I read (I think on reddit somewhere) that when Dicken's and
Dostoeyevsky met (or maybe they didn't meet, and Dos. was simply commenting on
Dicken's words) Dickens said that he feels that he has two people inside of
him, always at opposition to eachother, and that each of these two people
together makes up the whole of who he is as a person, to which Dos. replied
"only two?" Indeed, I feel quite the same way as the Russian in this respect,
and I can see this sort of notion in a very crystal clear sort of way expressed
in the Brothers K. I very much have inside myself an Aloysha, but I also have
inside of me a Dmitri, and as much as I don't want it to be the case (and I
think most everyone would agree on this point) I have a bit of Fyodor in me as
well.

And to get to the point I am really trying to make, in the story right now,
the action is rising, Mitya has stomped the head in of his father, and Aloysha
is acting as a mediator between all of the crucial characters of the novel
(which creates a very cool dynamic of the story) and at the end of the day, as
Aloysha goes back to the monestary to rest for the night, he learns that Father
Zossima, his mentor and perhaps his true father figure in the story (if you
insist on analyzing it as such), is in poor health and will indeed come to his
death in the very near future. Aloysha, knowing this, talks about how he feels
his place is in the monestary, with the father, and that all other wordly
responsibities don't matter in comparison to the illness of this Zossima.

This feeling is much similar to the feeling I feel right now. Currently, two
days ago, my little brother Evan has finished his donation of stem cells, and
the process of transplanting the cells into my father (excuse my crudeness in
terms here, there is surely a much more elegent and scientific way of saying
this) has just begun. My father was admitted into UTSouthwestern a week ago,
where he was administered chemeo in some amount throughout the week in
preperation of this transfusion. This is a sort of end cap on the entire
process that has gone on for the past 8 months, my father having had 8
treatment of chemeo in that, along with regular appointments, spinal taps, and
other things which I feel guilty not knowing the full details of. And it is at
this end cap that I have this feeling that my place is with my father. I have
this feeling for two reasons, one being scarier than the other. The first
reason is because I feel that this process is difficult, and that as much
support as my father can get can only help, and that it is my responibility to
give him that support. The second, scarier reason, is that my father may die in
this process, and if he does, that means that there are things about our
relationship that I can never right. That is the scarier thing.

And that is where I come at this weird conflicting feelings. Obviously, the
death of my father is a scary thing, and any reasonable sane person when asked
if they would be okay with the event of the death of a their father would
obviously say they would rather their father not die, and that they would
prefer if he would keep on living. However, my emotions in this instance are
different, and are something I have been struggling with pretty much ever since
he was diagonsed. You see, what worries me more about his death is not the
actual grief of his death itself (although for sure I know I will experience at
least some grief, even if it is fleeting and not at all like what I imagine it
might feel like) but instead the anguish at having his death come to a point
where I feel our relationship is on a cliffhanger. My father and I have had a
very strange relationship over the past few years, not even talking about my
childhood, which I'm sure a hypnotist could find some buried thoughts and
memories and emotions of things that I have tucked away in there, but just in
the past few years we have been in a weirld place that is hard to describe. I
still have moments where I have lingering hatred (perhaps hatred is too strong
a word) resentment, bitterness, and overall distaste for him. I have moments
where I think to who he is, how I was raised (by both him and my mother), and
how we interact, and I have displeasure in our relationship, and these moments
where in the past have been simply me being dissatissfied with the relationship
and nothing more, now are associated with moments of guilt as I have these
thoughts, these thoughts of a man who is fighting against a terrible disease, a
man who is fighting it as he fights everything else in his life, and needs my
support and my love.

And the truly conflicting thing is, these thoughts have even gone so far as to
give me a sense of "well fuck him anyway". This is the truely disconcerting
thing. I have had thoughts that, well maybe he doesn't get past it, and that's
where the story of my relationship with my father ends, and maybe I'm okay with
that. I have never gone so far as to entertain the idea that "well maybe he
does deserve it" as certainly, though I do have these qualms about my father, I
don't believe that any human no matter how vile ever "deserves" anything, and
even if the concept of one human deserving something were a reasonable one, my
father would certainly not be one who would deserve the treatment he has
received by this disease in the least. Indeed, let it be known, though I have
my troubles and my issues with my fathers actions towards me and our
relationship, and I have my issues with his ideaology, and how he lives his
life and the choices he has made through it, I know that truely deep down he is
not a bad man, and quite on the contrary I know that he has a very strong sense
of selfless giving towards his family, which includes me his son of course, and
I don't want to say that I know he loves us, because the word love doesn't mean
much of anything without context, but I know that his sense of giving towards
family is strong, perhaps the strongest thing that he feels. Of course I am
only speculating, but this is something inside of me that I know to be true,
and I can only know it to be true in having this relationship of father and
son.

However, I still have these reservations, these feelings of anomosity towards
him, lingering from my own actions and our relationship as it evolved over the
past six or so years through my time in college and afterward. Of course, I
know these thoughts are simply thoughts I cannot help in myself, and that all of
my thoughts are the consequences of my upbringing, my life, and of the universe
that provides and generates all things.

Still, the point in all of this is that there is still a discord in the
relationship between me and my father. In fact I have talked with my mother
more than with my father about this relationship, and this is only something
that can't be talked about, but will only come in time. But now that the
possibility of time is limited, now that it's unsure whether time will persist
past this transplant, this is where my feelings come from, and this is where it
comes back full cicle to the protagonist Aloysha, who feels he should be with
his Father Zossima in his last days and with nothing else. I feel my place now
is visiting my father, I need to see him, to be with him. Is it selfish? Do I
want this simply so that I don't have to live with the idea that if he does
die, I will be able to tell myself I did all I could to get things in a less
disconcordant way than I would otherwise? I don't think it is selfish. Seattle
Brett might have treated this moment selfishly (and I do still hold that
everything we do as human beings in done selfishly in a certian sense) but now
I know it in myself that my feelings of needing to be with my father come from
something else, something apart from me. Of course, it is not apart from me,
but it comes from my meditation of this world, the observance of my thoughts,
not from trying to control my thoughts. It is this observer, who observes this
feeling, this feeling of needing to be with my father. I know intellectually
the selfish reasons for wanting to visit him more, which is why the thoughts
could appear in the first place, but the thoughts and feelings appeared quite
on their own, without the guidance of the ego and it is simply the observance
of them that I am feeling now.

I made a visit this past sunday, four days ago, and I actually visited twice
with a session of Bikram Yoga sandwiched in between. I want to make time to
visit him, but there are so many other things I want to pursue in my life right
now that it makes finding time for it difficult. However, this feeling is
strong, and I am glad, as my heart has been eased on one point having visited
him. When I visited, the nurse there had to administer a Lovanox shot to him,
which he had to do for me after my incident at the hospital, and that got us to
talking about my experince. Something I've said a few times, is that in a way
it's much easier to be on that side than it is to be on this side, and I hold
to that, although for me I was only on that side for a few days, where as he is
on that side, and has been for over eight months now, but we got to talking
about that again, and my dad can agree to an extent. I then mentioned something
which I have said before I know to my mom, and maybe to my dad as well, I don't
remember, but I said it during my visit this past Sunday, that I wish I would
have told them at the time of my incident, but I knew I was going to be okay.
And the way I put it was, "I don't if it was foolishness, or false knowledge, or
where that knowledge came from, but I knew that my numbness was temporary,
that it didn't feel permanent, and that I knew I would get back the use of my
left arm, and that I wish I would have told my parents that, because it seemed
so obvious to me that it was temporary, and I didn't know that they were so
worried about that." And to that, my father replied, that he knows too that he
will get through this transfusion as well. And the way he put it, he put in a
way that I know was not false, he spoke candidly, in reply to my words of
course, but that, in spite of the percentages and prognosises that people give
of him, he knows that he will survive through this. It's true, it's genuine, or
at least, it's as true and genuine as I know it can be being on this side of
the disease and not that one, and the doubts I have been having that perhaps he
might not make it through this (for indeed I have had doubts that I haven't
talked about in this article, but they are there), doubts which I have known
and I wish to false, those doubts I can at least supress in good conscious.
Yes, I felt guilty supressing those doubts before the visit, for fear that I
was not supressing doubts, but instead supressing a realist attitude towards
this situation, but now I know that they are true, honest to god doubts that I
feel, and I can supress them honestly, knowing they are doubts and not thoughts
of acceptance. Acceptance is important, but now is not the time for that, and
these thoughts are not thoughts of acceptance. And so I will visit, and so I
will rejoice in my life, in my feelings of "being there" (oh there must be a
better word for that), and I will rejoice in the lives that we share together.
I will continue to visit, without expectation, because that is what I feel I
need to do, not to gain anything for myself or for my father, or for anyone
else, but because I simply feel that my place is with my father.

# 20180628

So this is the beginning of my second dedicated journal article. There are a
few things that I want to go over, and I'm not sure which to start with. The
first is a dream I had, that had me waking up a little disturbed, and the
second is I already forgot what it is. Oh, right, it has to do with a text I
got from my mom. Let's start with the dream.

Okay, so today I had a most peculiar dream. Fortunately, this one did not
involve marijuana in any way (the last dream I had was a couple nights ago, and
very much had to do with marijuana, but I that one, though it might be worth
writing down, was not near as interesting phycologically as this one). The
dream started (or at least the first thing I remember about the dream) in the
parking lot of a park. This park was similar to a park I remember visiting as a
kid where we had a sort of PE session once. The parking lot was on let's say
the south end of the park (this detail is not relevent, and I am only using
south to give indications of direction) and has a sort of open field from this
lot. I am referring to strictly the dream park by the way, and I don't think
this childhood PE experience has anything to do with the dream. Anyway, from
that parking lot, it opens into a sort of open field, but it's not really fully
open as there were paths and trees and stuff, so the field wasn't open enough
to play any sort of sport on, but there was a grassy part. Across this grassy
part, parallel to the parking lot, there was a path that goes across, and
across this path from the lot, was a sparsly wooded area. Not wooded, but there
were enough trees for that to be a detail that I noticed. In the dream I don't
go past this part, so that part of the dream is not really expanded upon, but
in the dream I knew it to contain picnic tables and things, where families
might bring food and picnic things and have a nice family night out. So in this
dream, the first thing I remember is being in a suburban, similar to the
suburban my mom had when we were growing up, and I am driving this suburban. I
remember my mom being involved in the dream somehow, I think she was in the
passenger side of the vehicle, and Kyle I know was in the back seat. So I'm in
the parking lot, and I remember saying something to the effect of "hey, lets go
over to the creek side of this park, I'd like to show it to you" or something
like that. You see, this from the parking lot of this park, one could drive to
the west (again, irrelevent direction) and towards the west side of the park
it became more dense, there were different things to do, and it was the same
park as the park where families might picnic, but in this area of the park were
sports fields and things of that nature along with a bit more winding road and
such. So I drive over to that part of the park, and at some point along the
ride, I remember making the decision that we were done there and that we wanted
to go home. Instead of using my phone to find the directions home, however, I
remember thinking something like I wanted to just find the way home and I
thought I knew it. So as I start to drive through this other section of the
park, driving as if on autopilot, driving through roads without thinking as if
I had taken this path many times before, Kyle starts reading to me about
Russian pronouncations. You see, I have been learning Russian lately, but I
have only just started, and at this point I have not gone beyond learning the
alphebet, which is why this came up in the dream. So Kyle start showing me
letters, and they just appear in the dream, and I start reciting them back to
him, the way they are pronounced. And what ends up happening is, Kyle gives me
a letter, I give him back the correct answer, but Kyle then tells me it is the
wrong answer. When I question him on it, he insists that it is the wrong
answer. In fact, I remember the letters, it was ю, and я, which are "yoo" and
"ya", and I know for a fact I said something in the dream like, "I know the
backwards R one is Ya" but Kyle kept insisting that it was "ee", and I said no,
"ee" is и, but I didn't put together until just now that they are both backward
versions of other english letters, and in the dream I was just insisting that
the backward R was not the sound "ee" but "ya". I remember getting very upset
in the dream at Kyle, and eventually I made it to a dead end in the road, a
sort of dead end that was the end of a parking lot where soccer moms might park
when their child has a game at the very end of the park, and beyond the soccer
fields I know there was a densly wooded area with a creek that marked the edge
of the park, and I knew that I was lost. So at this point I decide to stop
arguing with Kyle about the russian letters, and I begin to make my way back to
the original parking lot that I mentioned when the dream first started (or
rather back to when I first remember the dream), and when I make it back to
that parking lot, I am met by my dad. I don't remember driving up to him,
(indeed, I don't remember looking out of the car when I was driving at all, and
most of my dream took place inside the scope of the suburban) but I do
remember, when I was right next to him, I pulled up beside him in a parking
spot, and he was simply standing there, and I stopped so that he could open the
passenger side door and get in the car. At this point I think my mom had
magically gotten in the back seat, since she had gone out of my memory by that
point in the dream, and so the passenger seat was open, so my dad got in, and
he was upset, as if I was not doing as I was told, and that he was displeased
with my defience, and he might have said something, but at this point in the
dream I remember conceding to looking up my home address (1700 Tulane Dr., the
address of my parents house) on my phone, and starting up the GPS. At this
point, my dad commanded me to drive home, in the stern way that he does, and
after looking up the address I placed the phone GPS beside me like I do when I
drive with the GPS and began to make my way home. As I began to leave this
parking lot of the park, and go out on the road which ran North-South, which
was just east of the park, and marked the other end of the park, is when the
dream ended.

The reason I spell out this dream is not because I think anything remarkable
happened, but when I woke I was almost in a sweat. I knew I didn't have the
time near my, but looking outside I could tell that while it certainly was
morning, I knew I had not overslept, and I had my tablet next to me, which as I
mentioned in my previous article I have recently acquired, and I went to check
if it had finished it's windows updates, because I remembered that it had to do
that recently, and also to check the time on it, and it said something like
11:38. I had a very breif moment of panic, so breif in fact that the moment of
panic did not even happen as a realized that there was no way that it was past
11, and at the very worst I thought that it could only be 7:38, and the time
was off by a timezone. Upon opening the browser, I found that it was 6:38 in
the central time zone, and at that point I began to wake for real. It was nice,
feeling that awake at that time of day, and since today is a Thrusday and I
have no obligation to make my way to the gym to practice with Paco, I had
plenty of time to collect myself, have some water, drink some juice, rotate the
laundry, and perform some morning tasks that I usually perform in a bit more
hurry (or rather, not hurry, but with a sense of guilt as my morning tasks run
in to the time that I should be at work).

What struck me about this dream though, was two things. The first is my arguing
with Kyle about russian letters, which I now understand was probably my brain
sorting out which backward english letters coorespond to which russian sounds.
The fact that I got so upset at him for that though, actually does concern me,
and I don't feel guilty about it (for how can one ever feel guilty about the
happennings of a dream?) but it did disturb me for quite some time. I also have
been meaning to spend more time learning russian, but have let other things
take precedence, in particular, reading and writing in english, which I greatly
enjoy. So I think there was a bit of apprehension and insecurity about my lack
of learning Russian in the dream as well. There is probably some significance
to the fact that it was Kyle I was getting upset at, and this dream does remind
me of one road trip back in the days when I used to play Go, and I wanted to
try my hand at blind Go during this trip, and I remember getting upset at Kyle,
because he had some sort of handheld device that he was keeping track of and
playing the stones on, and when we got to move 30 or so, I tried to play a
stone and he informed me that a stone had already been played at that position,
and I remember arguing with him that there was not a stone on that position,
and that he must have made some mistake in interpreting the moves I had given
him, because earlier, I had remembered playing in a different way. At that
point, I remember my dad making a comment that the one who could see the stones
was probably right, and maybe he was, but I disliked that my opinion on the
matter was being shrugged off so matter-of-factly, and I remember at the very
lesat thinking that, while it could be true that my memory of the board state
could very easily be wrong, I also had strong memory of playing the stone in a
different position, and not only did I have memory, but I had reasoning as to
why I would have placed that stone in the place I did, and I also knew how the
way I phrased the way the stone was placed could be mis-interpreted by Kyle,
who did not enjoy Go at all in the way I did. So at that point, as I thought to
it, I am almost certain what happened is I told him to place the stone in a
certain way in relation to the other stones (because trying to keep track of
absolute positioning I knew would be too hard for me) and Kyle misinterpreted
my words and placed the stone in the wrong location, and that created a board
state on the handheld which was different than the state in my head. All of
this ended pretty much at that point, because I remember trying to continue on,
but after about 30 stones I knew the board state would be difficult to remember
anyway, as Go board states can get very complicated rather quickly, and this
entire thing was just an attempt to handicap myself to the point where I could
even get Kyle to play with me in the first place, and I knew that he had no
real interest anyway, and that the only reason he would even humor me in that
moment was because of the boredom of a long road trip, so at that point we
dismissed the game, and I remember suggesting perhaps we play for real, but
Kyle didn't want to, and that was that.

That whole experience, and me being upset at both Kyle and in a lesser way my
dad, was the first memory that came in to my mind after I woke from my dream
today. It was probably almost exactly ten or eleven years ago that this
happened, and I am certain that this memory led to the events of the dream
today. In fact, the concept of Kyle giving me "the state of things how it is"
(either a Go board state, or the association of Russian letters to their
pronounciation) and me trying to recall that state from memory is so strikingly
similar that I feel this has to be the reason for the inclusion of Kyle in my
dream today. And also the inclusion of my father as well. That's actually
really fascinating, now that I think about it, how very similar the memory fits
the dream, but with my current task of learning Russian rather than my task of
playing a game of Go.

So yeah, most of this session has been dominated by that dream, so much so that
I haven't even got to the second part I wanted to talk about which is the text
(or rather, group text sent to me, my brothers, lacey, and Granny and Papa)
sent by my mom. The reason I find this text so interesting is a couple things.
The first is that I didn't fully understand the text at first, and actually had
to look up a word to understand really what was going on, and the second is my
reaction to it. So enough mystery about it, this is the text in it's entirety.

    Text Message
    Tuesday 11:17 AM
    Ann Webster Family

    We just had the
    blessing of the cells
    with the Chaplin and
    they are hanging the
    stem cells.

That is the exact text as it appears in my phone as of this moment. One thing I
will say is that I did not see this text until I got back from Jiu-Jitsu class
that lunch, which would have been about an hour later, and by that point,
multiple people had responded with things like "praying for you" and stuff like
that. There was also a text sent from my mom sent at 11:28 (after both her
parents had responded) saying "\*chaplian" (escape sequence mine since
markdown), which followed with a text from Lacey, also giving her prayers.

So what struck me first about this was, I when I first saw this message, it
showed up as seven messages in my phone, since it was a group message and a
bunch had already responded. (Me nor any of my brothers responded) So when I
read the first message, I didn't know what a Chaplin was, and the correction to
chaplain didn't help either. When I first read the message, I just saw
"blessing" and thought she was asking for blessings, like someone may do,
similar to how someone may ask for prayers, but upon reading it further, I
realized that it read "the blessing of the cells", so I thought maybe she was
asking for us to pray for the cells to be blessed, which I also thought was
strange, but I know both my parent but particularly my mom can be very
superstitious when it comes to religion and things of that nature. My mom is
the sort that believes in the bible literally, and takes the six thousand year
interpretation of the world to be the actual truth. I don't resent her for it
(much), but I am fascintated by it because she is otherwise a rather
intelligent woman. However, upon getting to the point where I could entirely
read the message and comprehend what it said, I noticed that "the blessing of
the cells" was an event that happened with "the Chaplin" (chaplain as she
corrected herself later) and that it was an event that happened before the
transfusion. This is all I have to go on.

Now, at this point, I very much want to say that I do not intend to bring this
up pretty much to anyone. It was one text message, and if some ass hole wants
to give his blessing to a bag of Evan's blood before an extremely delicate and
scary (there must be a better word than scary to describe the chance of 20
percent death and 50 percent prognosis, as I don't want to portray fear, but
rather the sense of, this shit is serious and must be taken seriously)
infusion, and if that blessing make my mom, and maybe my dad too, I don't know,
but definitely my mom, feel better, than so be it. I don't care of the pope
himself comes with his stupid hat kisses the rod they use to hang, as long as
the pope isn't ill and it doesn't effect the procedure in any way. However, I
did not know what I chaplain was, and had to look it up to find out that a
chaplain is like a pastor, but the word chaplain is used when he is the
religous figure of an institution such as a hospital or prison or other such
place, so that the cells were blessed by the guy who I'm sure does this shit
all the time around there.

And that is what got me to thinking, how gross and disgusting that practice is.
I'm all for giving people a sense of hope or meaning, that kind of shit is what
things like Christianity is for, it's for people who don't have an explanation
for the things that happen in the world and inside ourselves, so they come to
the lowest hanging fruit because that fruit makes sense to them, and if eating
of that fruit helps them cope, or deal, or otherwise make better of their lives
in a positive way, than who am I to say that the fruit isn't there and that
it's the product of thousands of years of in-factual cultural evolution?
However, it's not the actual blessing of the cells which disgusts me, it's the
concept that somehow this chaplain has more right, or more capability, or more
divinity with the lord that he should do it rather than someone close to the
people involved. This is how this ass hole makes his living, is by telling
people that he is able to bless their cells, and that the lord will guide the
doctors hands, and he will use this farce to give hope to people in desperate
situations, and that's how he makes his living. It's fucking gross. Like
despicably gross.

And obviously, even bringing up the topic of this text message would be wrong
to do with my family, even my brothers. Perhaps Jason would be the only one I
would come close to saying anything to, but he and I aren't close enough that
something as trival as this text message that we both received would be a topic
of conversation that he and I would have together. So instead this is something
that will most likely never be discuss except long in the future when my dad
has recovered and I bring it up in a conversation over dinner or something, and
even then it the topic of religion is still such a touchy one, even with my
mom, that we are all wise enough to avoid the subject completely. So this is
what I'm left with.

I could go on a little bit, but I'm over my time and I have to get back to
work, so I will leave it at that. It just gives me a strange sense of discord,
not only my opinion of this text message and also my reaction to it and the
fact that I can't rectify it by bringing it up. It's amazing how utterly wrong
and disgusted it makes me feel over something that shouldn't be that big of a
deal. And it's not that big of a deal, I can very easily move on with my life,
but this is just one more thing about religion and my parents that will never
be aligned, and it makes me want to vomit. That is all.

Until next time.

# 20180629

Okay, so I had another dream today that I want to share briefly. I did not
intend for this to become a dream journal, but as long as I am having vivid and
memorable dreams that can be interpreted easily, I will continue to write about
them, and if nothing else it gives me a topic to get into the flow of writing
as I start each entry. At this moment, I haven't ever come to a point where I
feel like I have nothing to say, but I am only three articles in at this point
and who knows when I have been doing this for a few weeks I might become
exhausted of this exercise and feel as though it becomes wearisome, or
repetitive, or some other such feeling, and I don't want that, and writing
about dreams I think will help not only for me to have more memorable dreams
(because I really do love waking up and thinking about a dream) but also it
will help in sparking ideas to write about here.

So without further ado, this particular dream was a three parter. I don't
recall much about the first part, except that it invovlved Isiah from BJJ, who
I have not actually interacted much with as of late, but is a pretty cool guy,
and I end up eating Psilocibin Mushrooms with him in the dream. He shows me a
stash, and I take some of it and I eat them, and there is a particularly large
cap that he says I should only eat if I'm feeling very adventurous, and I end
up eating it.  I don't remember much of the dream beyond those details. The
mushrooms were in a room which was like Grant's room in Denton, but that
location has not come up before in my dreams, so it seems a bit minor of a
detail.

The second part of the dream involved me going to Colorado. I was with someone,
I forget who, but in this instance of going to Colorado, it was Peter and
Madison, and me and I'm pretty sure this someone was a girl, and instead of
driving there, we decided to take the ski lifts there. Obviously that's absurd,
but in the dream there was a network of ski lift like infrastructure for
trasportation, and Peter and Madison were in the seat in front of us, and me
and this girl (who I didn't interact with much, and I even forget if she was a
girl or not) were together in the seat behind them. The most striking thing
about this dream was a couple things. Most of the dream was about dialog
between Peter and I as he turned back and we discussed things, although the
actual dialog, and even what the dialog was regarding escapes me at this time.
The two notable things were this. One, I remember a moment, when we are going
over one of the poles that holds up the ski lift, where Peter and Madison after
they went over it turn back and inform us to be careful of that pole, and I
remember thinking that it can't be too bad, but when we go over it, we bounce
quite violently, and I had to hold myself in the dream to keep from falling out
of the lift. The second thing I remember is, shortly after this bump (the ride
was mostly smooth besides that one massive bump) we decide to stop at one of
the stops (because this ski lift like apparatus had stops along the way) and
visit another place before reaching our destination. This place is another
dream location that is extremely memorable for me, and I know I've written
about before, but this section of the dream ended before we explored it again.
It is difficult for me to recall the dream where this location was in the past,
but the location can best be described as a deserty area with lots of mountains
that have flat tops that come up and create canyon like valleys between them,
and the entire desert area is a pilgramage type thing with the start of the
pilgramage being a water place with lots of grassy mounds that create a lot of
paths, where lots of people go to recreate in, followed by this plilgramage
desert thing, and followed by an indoor hallway that goes to a snowy place. I
don't want to spend too much time describeing this whole thing because that is
another dream, and the only detail is that we decided to stop at the first area
just to check it out before getting back on the lift.  However, we merely
decided that, and this portion of the dream ended before we even really got off
the lift. I don't have memory of getting off the lift, only that we intended to
do so.

The final part of the dream is the most beautiful, and as I was waking up I
only wanted to go back to sleep to experience more of this dream. What made
this section of the dream beautiful was not anything that happened in the
dream, but the beauty of the locale. In this section of the dream, I was
returning to Seattle, the dream version of Seattle that I have had before, and
in this dream version of Seattle, as I was driving up, there is a point you hit
where you get there, and the whole thing is like one path that goes around this
great mound, and from the top of this section of the path, you can see the path
going off to the left, and a whole grassy area that is the mound that doesn't
have any path on it, but instead is just a great grass that goes down almost
like a ski slope with trees on each side and everything, and from the top here
you can see the beautiful water off in the distance, the water of Seattle that
is a bit like the lake that you see from Lakeview drive when I first got to
Seattle with all the boats and everything out there, but the dream version
where it's even more open, more diverse and so much more expansive and
wonderful. So this section of the dream was mostly me driving my way to this
hill top place, and me observing the humble sights, those sights which are also
breathtaking in the dream but that I can't recall in their details, as I
thought about my destination. I remember thinking about the destination as I
was driving there, and in this dream I was also on my way to meet Kim, the girl
I dated twice in college, as in a went on two seperate dates with her. The
reason Kim comes up I think is two reasons. The first and less artistic reason
is because I seem to recall seeing pictures of her on facebook at one point
visiting Seattle. I could be wrong on that point but I remember seeing it and
memory is the only important thing in dreams. The second is that, while I was
in seattle, and I was smoking all the weed and getting unreasonably high all
the time, I remember having a sketch notebook that was an absurd size,
something like 11x14, and I had this idea of using flower and star patterns to
create a scene I would call "Kim and Brett on the Rooftop" which would portray
in a sense the scene of her and I sitting on the roof of building at UTD, where
we sat after our second "date", and we just sat there for 10 minutes, and as we
sat there I thought about her, and about our dates, and I just decided that it
wasn't really flying. I thought about how I could have gone in to make a move,
to try and kiss her or something, but it felt wrong, like it was disingenuous,
and that I would simply be doing it to keep up with the social norms of what
that date and what that moment would have been like in a movie. This was a
beautiful moment for me, because though my kiss with Maddie months before had
been very bold "pink" in my memory of what that was like, this was instead the
most beautiful "gray" memory I can have. It was resolve, it was knowing that
Kim and I just weren't sparking, and I saw the beauty of that in that moment,
and it's more beautiful than grey. This happened I think my senior year, before
Scarlett, and Seattle was obviously after Scarlett, and I had wanted to capture
this moment in art somehow, but even in Seattle I wasn't able to find the
inspiration to make that piece, and I probably never will. Maybe I will at some
point, but I would have to go back to Seattle and smoke a lot of weed and go to
a particular park and find a spot on a bench that I have very clearly in my
mind, the same park where Sockeye tryouts were (and I only mention those
tryouts as an identifier and not because I want to associate this with those
tryouts in any way) and I would have to sit there with the very same sketchbook
with a pencil and make it appear, as if something else were guiding my hand.
That may happen in my life time, but maybe not, we will see. Anyway, that huge
tangent I went on merely to say, in this dream, I was driving to meet her
there, and I remember thinking about the junction of this top of the hill in
the dream world and the lake water view from there. And when I arrived there, I
remember stopping the car to park, because the rest would be a walk down to the
part of that section in the dream world that is at the bottom of the hill where
there is a VIP club that I am welcome to (and I am welcome there just because
it's my dream world and it would be weird if I weren't, I suppose I could be
rejected but that is not this club), and I was planning to walk down and meet
Kim at the entrance to that club so we could go down to the water and go on a
long walk together and reunite after a long time. I want to be clear that I
have no intention of reuniting with the real Kim, we truly were incompatible
chemistry wise when we dated, but this dream version of her represents a sort
of non-sexual uniting of two souls that miss eachother and want to see
eachother. She represents something inside of me, especially in this dream and
not in my active conscious mind. And so I remember in this dream, I made it to
this ridge, and I stopped and got out of my car, and stood there and was taken
away by the view. I was not taken away in the sense that I lost my senses or my
capabilities, but instead I simply looked out and took in it's beauty, a beauty
which I knew was there but always manages to take you everytime you take it
even though you know what you're about to see, and I acknowledged this feeling
of admiration, serene beauty, and I accepted it and turned toward the path to
see something I didn't expect. What I had expected was to go along this path on
my own, and to meet Kim at the bottom like I said, but instead when I turned to
the path, I saw her there, eager to meet me, a bit in the distance but not so
far that I was entirely sure that it was her and I could examine what she was
wearing, perhaps 100 meters in dream distance, and I saw she was wearing a
rather intricate swimsuit, the kind of swimsuit which would accentuate all of
her best feminine features, but at the same time modest, something she herself
might call cute, but I could only call the perfect swimsuit for her body at
that time as I saw, as if she gave thought to who I was and what I would like
to see her wear. And all of this I must remind you was all taken very
non-sexually, as if we were more acquainted than we actually are in real life
and we had shared intimate things before, as if our dating experienced turned
not into a relationship that would have a definite "break-up" point, but as if
our relationship would have turned from a couple dates of two people that don't
spark to a sort of comfort in sharing things with eachother that we would come
to eachother to discuss things and meet for food occasionally to talk about
mundane things like how our new job was going or how our life endeavors were
treating us, and through this relationship we hadn't met in a long time since
life had taken us different directions, but now life brought us back into the
same direction again and we were meeting again and we both had accepted and
were glad in the sort of relationship that we had had as two human beings, and
I saw her there, and with that feeling I saw her and was wholly surprised,
because I did not expect to see her at this juncture and expected to meet her
further down, but she had walked up to meet me and had been waiting for not too
long, because she was expecting me and knew when I would arrive, and when I saw
her I was taken by surprise and then a feeling of warmth that can only be
described in the context of this terrible run-on sentance which I should be
punished for writing. I saw her there, her beauty coming out through the
swimsuit she was wearing, and she smiled upon seeing me, and I smiled as well,
and we came towards eachother and we shared a hug. We embraced breifly, me
feeling her body and her swimsuit against my clothed self and noting the
juxtaposition of those two feelings, swimsuit and clothes, and the embrace was
breif but when it ended we stil held hands I told her that I wasn't expecting
to see her here, and that she didn't have to climb all the way up here, and she
replied that she knew that, but wanted to surprise me, to which I replied that
she looked beautiful, and that the backdrop of the water only made her more
beautiful, and then I took her hand and we both looked out to the water and
took in it's beauty together, both admiring it, but at the same time both
maintaining our facilities, our wits so to speak, not letting the beauty
control our emotions but instead letting the beauty become a part of our
emotions, and I looked out upon it, upon that scene, and everything felt right
with the world. And at that moment, we turned back to eachother, made eye
contact, and without even talking to eachother we both knew that I was to take
her hand and lead her down to the lake where there was water and we would walk
and talk and share eachother at that gorgeous scene.

It was at this point that I woke up. I will remark that I know last night I
slept naked, and I do not recall having any morning wood when I woke, and I
usually make some note of morning wood, especially now that I have abstained
from masturbation. I make this point only to say that there was no sexual
interest or motivation for this dream, and that the beauty of it was not the
sort of sensual and sexual beauty that we as mammals of the homo sapien race
only so much like to indulge in, but instead the beauty is the kind of beauty
that makes you feel utter awe, not even like you're lucky to be alive and
witness it, but just that it takes you away, not taking away your senses or
reasonableness, but instead the sort of beauty that fills you with awe and
becomes just another part of the whole beautiful stirring pot that is our
emotions.

When I woke, all I wanted to do was go back to sleep to experience more of the
dream again, but alas, that was not to be, as I had to make my way to training.

Speaking of, I have had so far a great day as far as training is concerned.
Paco taught a lot of standup things that I like a lot, and we had a very good
morning session. Also, today I had some very good rolls with people at no-gi
open mat, one with the little short hispanic dude who I am friends with on
facebook but I forget what his preferred name of reference is. David is my
guess, as that is his middle name on facebook, and his first name is something
like Fredricco or something, but yeah.

I think I have decided to forego registering for the Five grappling tourney.
This is something I have been struggling with lately, and I don't know if it is
connected, but I had a lot of anxiety for Dallas open, and I am getting a lot
of anxity for this tournament, and I can't help but think that I have created
an association with my loss in Denver to my subsequent drive home and visit in
jail only fifteen hours later, and that association is acting as a strong
catalyst for my tournament anxiety. Obviously I have gotten tournament anxiety
in the past, but this is on a new level. And I hate that I am feeling this
anxiety, but I think it is wise to respect it, and take a break from the
tournament scene. As much as it pains me, I really don't want to sign up for a
tournament and lose, as I already have excuses for my losing and I see that as
the expected outcome. Indeed, I am a new blue belt, and I know there are a lot
of killer blue belts out there, and I know this is something that everyone
struggles with, but there is something more. It's not that I expect to lose,
but it is more that I think I associate now the feeling of lose with my
experience in jail, which is a horrible thing to associate. The thing is, I
don't know if it would be wise to compete anyway to overcome that anxiety, or
instead to just wait it out until the weight of that felony charge is entirely
off my shoulders. As much as I don't want the latter to be the case, and as
silly and stupid as that sounds, either win or lose I don't expect to gain much
from competing. Rather, I think what I should do is go to more open mats, and
expose myself to more training partners, so that rather that discovering myself
and my Jiu-Jitsu through competition, discover it more organically and more
playfully through increased exposure. I am sure that I will compete again, and
I will certainly still be a blue belt when this felony charge gets resolved, so
I feel most confident in waiting this out. I'm am still mentally conflicted,
but in my heart this makes the most sense to me.

I almost forgot what I really wanted to journal about today. That thing was the
interaction with my mom yesterday. So yesterday, or the day before, I forget, I
wrote about how I have this feeling, similar to the feeling of Aloysha with
Father Zossima in Brothers Karamazov, where I have this need to stay with my
father in this time. So Thursday, I called my mom after work, but before yoga,
at around 5:30 in the afternoon, and when I called her and she answered I could
tell immediately that I woke her. Her voice was distant and vague, and I quite
honestly think I have never heard that voice before. It reminded me of the
voice of Ciara when she would wake. I like that voice, but upon hearing it I
knew I woke her. The conversation started like that. I called, and she answered
after about three or four rings, and she said "hello" in a very delierious
voice. I replied in a bit more of an enthusastic voice and I said hey, and let
there be a silence for a bit. After that silence, I then continued on with
the start of the conversation, which we had talked about having before, saying
that I was calling just to catch up on how things were going and to see if it
would be okay to visit. What followed was about six to eight or so minutes of
her describing to me my fathers condition, how he has been having diareahha and
fevers and is running a 104.5 temperature, and she mentioned a lot of things
about blood counts and transfusions and lots of other things that the doctors
have been doing to keep it under control. I stood there, in the stairwell of my
workplace just listening to her talk, mostly just taking it in and not
responding at all in any way, and instead just letting her talk and tell me
the things that she wanted to tell me. She also mentioned how she can't even
bring in water and other things into the room because his immune system is so
compromised and such that they can't risk anything to infect him, and she went
on like this like I said for over six minutes. Towards the end I started
contibuting with things such as "yeah" or "hmm" or "right" but I still just
stood there, pacing, and listening. And this sort of thing is what I knew he
would be going through, but hearing it from my mother made it more real in a
sense. I knew it would be rough, but I wasn't sure in what way it would be
rough, so it was interesting to here her talk to me about my fathers condition.
And listening to her, I got the very distinct impression that she very much
didn't want me to come, and I say this for this reason. So many times,
especially, and I have memories of this as a child, coming back from Houston
after visiting family, my mother and father would discuss events and
conversations of the previous week or weekend or whatever, and they would talk
about different people in the extended family, and their discussion would
always be in a sort of "negative but benefit of the doubt" tone. Saying things
like "and did you see what she was wearing" or "yeah, she stayed fixated on
that topic of conversation for so long" and other things about the things
people said, and the things people wore, and how someone acted in a certain way
in a certain setting. And not only that but they would always do so in a way so
as to speak poorly of the people which we had just had conversation with and
shared time with. And I paint this in perhaps too negative of a light, because
I know surely they also talked about good things too, like relatives of
relatives getting a new job or talking about how some new significant other was
good for someone, and things such as that, but in my memory, I remember this
sharply, because I would always reflect on their conversation and tone as I
eavsdropped their words from the back of the car, and I would contrast that to
the conversation and tone that they had during the events and during the
gatherings, and they were so remarkably different that it rose in me a feeling
of disgust. And the disgust was at the sheer two-facedness of it all, because
though I did enjoy our gatherings to an extent, I was generally speaking very
much against them as a child, not only becasue they were always sandwiched
between a long drive from home to Houston and back, but also because I took
very little interest in the conversations of adults, and would have only my
handheld video games to ammuse myself during the whole time, and while I
enjoyed playing video games, I selfishly saw no reason to bring ourselves so
often to this entirely different city to play video games there, when I could
have just as easily stayed at home and played the console games that I
generally enjoyed more. Indeed, as a child I was quite bent on playing video
games in most of my free time, but I digress. My point is, the distaste for
these gatherings that I had in myself, I was always as open as I could be about
them, and would keep to myself in the corner with my games and make my
appearances as I was obligated to, and I would be cordial enough simply because
that was the path of least resistance, all the while my parents would continue
with the festivities and the nicities and all of the other obligations of
socail interactions with extended family, and they would give an air of
enjoying themselves that I thought could only be false as I listened to them
speak back on the whole experience in the car ride back. Of course, in more
adult eyes looking back, I see that one can still enjoy oneself and still
gossip ruefully about the people you enjoyed, but I rarely enjoyed myself in
anyway and saw this same distaste in their ride back. I mention all of this to
say, I know both sides to my parents, both the outward side that they show to
their family, and the inner side that they share with only eachother, but which
I as their child was able to overhear in that situation, and knowing both those
sides, I could sense something in this in the conversation with my mom
yesterday. Indeed, she was being entirely genuine with me as she explained for
her time my father's condition, and when she was done I started talking for a
bit about how I'm not sure where it comes from but lately I have had this
feeling that I need to visit more, but even as I was saying something so short
as that my mom would inturrupt me in my words to attend to the nurses that were
there caring for my father and to attend to her motherly duties that I know she
feels so strongly for in herself, and even as I said my words, I could get the
sense that she very much did not want me to visit. So after I was inturrupted
briefly in the middle of my short thought, I finished the thought, but instead
of going on to the next thought that I would have shared had I not gotten this
sense from her, I instead put the ball in her court, and gave her entierly the
option to tell me to just stay the fuck away. But, of course, since my mom is
too nice, she did not take that opportunity, and instead we went back and forth
a little bit about how my father's condition again as if to deter me. I then
said something to the effect of how I don't mind those things and still feel
strongly like you both need my support, but I did then go on to say that I'm
not sure if visiting is the right way to support, again giving her the
opportunity to tell me to stay the fuck away, but of course again she didn't
take and said how she wasn't sure either. So at this point I left the stairwell
and said something like, "well, how about I go to yoga and I'll text you when
I'm done and we can go from there" and even at that point she kept saying how
she would text me, but even in that I could sense that she wasn't sure what she
was meant to do, at which point I said something like, "No, don't even think
about me, I'll text you and if you don't reply I'll just assume your sleeping
or something and I won't bother you any further" and we left it at that before
we shared our conversation ending formalities and I moved on.

The entire conversation lasted something like nine minutes if I recall
correctly from what my phone read. Looking back the call started at 5:30 and
lasted 8 minutes total. And I remember when I finished, and I looked at my
phone, I was in a position where my office was to my right, and the parking
garage was on my left, and I could see 114 the road that would lead to the
hospital on the right and to yoga to the left. And I looked at all these things
and I was able to put together the map of everything in my head along with the
timeline of how things would go in the future, and again like I said about my
perspective on the tournament earlier in this entry, I knew in my heart what
the correct thing to do was but my mind and reasoning and logic hadn't
proccessed everything yet, and so I felt conflicted mentally but not
emotionally, but the mental conflict indeed does create a sort of emotional
one, but this confict was instead a sort of destruction of my emotions as I
forced myself to try and see this entire thing from a logical and zoomed out
perspective.

In that moment, the primary thought in my head was actually the same as
Aloysha's in the Brothers Karamazov, after he joined the hands of Ivan and
Katerina, of that of a righteous fool. Indeed, where did my feeling of being
with my father come from? And why only just now did it make sense for me to
support them in this time. My father was in no state to be presentable. I
thought back to my experience in the hospital, and I felt shame at my present
state more than anything. I didn't want people to see me in that state, I
wanted to find my inner peace, and endure my feelings of pain and also the
feelings of narcotic numbing on my own, without the sympathy of others. I was
in a pitiful state, and I did not want to receive pity, as receiving pity only
made me feel more pitiful, and I didn't want to feel more pitiful but less
pitiful, so I wanted all the people who meant well and cared for me and wanted
to be there for me to go away so that I could enjoy (indeed, enjoy is the word,
but not in its traditional sense) my suffering in peace, and on my own, so that
I could find my inner self and use that inner self to get through my time
there. And I have talked about this with my father, and though he has said
otherwise (indeed, my father is much more extraverted than I, who consider
myself having a rather extreme, if not maybe a little disengenuous, case of
introversion), I thought about my own feelings and emotions. Indeed, if my
feeling of being with my father is genuine, why is it just now eight months
after he has been diagnosed, that I feel the need to see him? I know in myself
what changed, but those changes are only recent, and quite honestly they don't
hold up to scrutiny. What a saintly fool I am!

Indeed, it would make sense to visit my father just to be with him in his
current state in the heat of battle, as his body attempts aggressively to
accept the stem cells donated by my brother Evan, if I had been there for him
in his other states, but I have not and have only visited sporadically and in
times of better health, in the times between his treatments of Chemo where he
is feeling higher energy and less beaten down. If I had visited in his lower
times there, if my feelings of being there for him and for my mom had been much
stronger like they are now before in the past eight months and I had seen him
in his pitiful and beaten states and helped him through those times, and I knew
that my support in those other moments were appreciated, and that it helped,
and that I provided something for him, if I had been there in those moments
with that effect, then surely I would have insisted that I visit in this moment
as well. But I didn't, and so why now, at the time when he is beaten down the
worst, after I had so many opportunities to give my visits and my support a
test drive, why now at the worst time should I give my support a try? I of
course have my best intentions in mind, but my past actions make it so I can't
follow through on these feelings I have, it doesn't make sense, because I would
I know that I would be doing more good than harm?

And this is where I go back to the conversation with my mother. In that moment,
looking left and right at all the things I would do in that moment, I hadn't
gone through those thoughts yet, but my emotions knew them, and my thoughts
eventually independently came to the same line as my heart as I made my way to
my car and drove out of the parking garage and made my way west to yoga. I
struggled through my thoughts, doing my best to become an observer of my
emotions but not letting them guide my thoughts, and the thoughts I just
described above are the thoughts I came to in that drive. And when I arrived at
yoga I knew that it was not right for me, in that moment, being unable to
change the past eight months of my actions, to visit my father that evening.
Instead, I knew it was right to send my mother a message indicating my
intentions at that moment, and to instead find another time to visit my
parents.

I also thought back to my visit that weekend, where my father told me that he
knew he was going to get through this. My mother and father have gotten through
this so far with the support and everything else that has guided them through
this battle, and they can continue to do what has worked. This has been eight
months for them supporting eachother through this, and at this sort of climax
of it, they can continue to do so. If I were a wishing man I would be wishing
that I could go back in time and change myself, tell myself to visit more
through the poor times as much as the good times, but I didn't do that already,
and it's foolish to wish for such things. Instead, I can try and give my
support in the best way I can.

So after I finished the Bikram yoga class, I messaged my mom and said this.

    So, after our convesation I thought about and think it would be wise to not
    visit tonight and let you both get rest. Have some of my strength as you
    both go through this today, and I'll keep up to date with caring bridge and
    messages. Much love.

To which my mom replied with

    Thank you for making the decision! I am not great at making those right
    now. Love you too!

That message did not come until two minutes later, and at that point I had
already put the phone in the shoe and gone to the Yin class which I had decided
last minute that I wanted to join. And I had a great Bikram class and a great
Yin class.

On a much lighter note, the speed dating event that I signed up for was
canceled tommorrow, and will happen instead like a full fucking month from now.
At first I was really dissappointed about that, but instead I thought about it
and that gives me an opportunity to go to the Roughnecks game tomorrow, which
will be fun. It's a blessing in disguise I think. I will plan on messaging my
mom tomorrow to see how my dad is doing, and to see if visiting is something
that will make sense at that point. If it is, I think the plan will be to go to
the 3 o clock bikram class tomorrow, and then the Roughnecks game after, which
means I'll have time either around noon or just after noon (or before noon) to
visit. Before noon actually probably makes the most sense, but I don't know
what the state of "eating food" will be for my dad but if it's okay than before
noon would be a good time so that he can socialize and eat, if he is in a state
where socializing and eating is going to be a thing that is even on his mind.
This time I will be more keen on the signals I get from my mom and see what to
do from there.

# 20180630
So today was the day that I was planning on doing the speed dating event, but
that was canceled so instead I am going to plan on going to the Roughnecks game
in about an hour. I will arrive late, but fuck it, I don't want to watch the
first quarter anyway.

I still haven't decided if I want to do this journaling in the morning or the
afternoon. I want learning the Russian language to take priority, not only
because I do want to seriously learn it, but also because I feel that the
morning while the brain is still warming up is the best time to learn something
so taxing as learning a language, and my mind will be more receptive to the new
words and concepts and grammatical ideas in the morning compared to later in
the day, I know that. However, if I am to follow the trend of writing down my
dreams in this journal, I should definitely write sooner rather than later as I
am apt to forget my dreams by this time in the after noon. Indeed, it is late
now, 5:30, after the time when I would normally get off of work, and I had a
dream but I have forgotten most of it by this point, so that leaves me in a bit
of a predicament. I might elect to write about the dream first, if I have one,
and do this journalling just before I begin doing my Russian work for the day,
with some actual work thrown in the mix in the morning so I don't feel too
guilty about the whole thing, all before going to Jiu-Jitsu, at which point I
could return, do my work in the afternoon, along with whatever reading I want
to get done. That seems like the best course of action. Indeed, also, I feel as
though I tend to have the most ideas of what to write about in the morning, and
currently when I have those ideas, I will try to make note of them in my head
so that I remember them when I get to the journal, but later in the afternoon,
not only has the magic or spark of those ideas escaped, if not even the idea
entirely, but my motivation to write about these things has passed. I would
then leave my media consumption to the evening, be that a Russian TV show, or
novel reading, or my mastabatory youtube watching, just before bed as I am
eating my meal for the day. I think that is the best course of action when it
comes to the schedule for how these things will probably end up turning out.

So about this dream. Like I said, I don't remember much about my dream. I know
earlier in the day I had memory of it before the point that I have memory now,
but the earliest I can remember is, I was in a sort of rusty trapdoor, and I
was walking back in to it after looking around for my father. I was looking
around this area, and I don't remember what happenend at that point or what the
area was like, but I do remember having a sort of sense of "actually, let's
pretend like I was never looking here and escape back and pretend like I wasn't
doing this" which I think is probably a sense of my feeling to be with my
father followed by my recent events of calling myself a righteous fool put
together in a sort of dream way, and so after I was done exploring this area, I
was going to go back down into this rusty trap door which led to I don't know
where, at which point my father, along with some of his work colleagues which I
have never met but heard of before and have pictures in my head of what I
imagine their faces look like, finds me escaping down this trap door and says
something like "Hey, what are you doing here," in a very good natured and
surprised to see me sort of way. I remember at that point, I had that instant
where, when you are trying to fabricate an alibi, and the entire reason for
that alibi vanishes instantly before it can be used and you decide to entirely
abandon it and pretend like you weren't trying to fabricate an alibi, at that
moment I entirly abandoned my alibi and immediatly came up with a different
one, closer to the truth, saying that I was just coming here to look for him,
which was partially true but I made it sound like I had just started looking
and was coming up the trapdoor rather than going down it. My father took this,
and I came up to him, and the only other thing I am able to remember about this
dream was that, after I woke up, I got the very strong feeling that one does
when having a dream that it was my dream self understanding the situation
better than my real self, and that my father was good enough to visit today and
that I should go through with my plan to visit.

So taking this article through the rest of the day then, most of this day I
have been scraping through resources on the Russian language, looking through
various textbooks, youtube videos, tv shows, and articles, and whatever else,
trying to find the best resource for me to use to learn Russian. In between, I
began reading the B and N version of the Aeneid that I purchased some days ago,
and despite it being an somewhat archaic one, I find it to be quite readable
actual, more so than a lot of other translations of ancient works like this
one, and I quite like it because in the notes of the translation it talks about
the traslators great care in trying to maintain the tone of the original
without sacrificing the readability of it. The effect is something quite
noticably "old poemey" which I dislike a bit, but something which I believe I
will quite enjoy actually.

After doing that for some time, I called my mom and talked with here a bit. I
called her just before noon, after I was browsing reddit looking at my nsfw
subs for a bit and weirding myself out a touch, I gave myself ample time
in-between doing that and calling her so as to not feel so strange about it. In
fact, I think that is when I read the aeneid. Regardless, when I called her,
she was clearly distruaght to a point, but I feel she is staying strong, but
she was talking to be about my fathers condition, and she mentioned his dignity
(which was the word I was looking for earlier, I used pitiful earlier, but
dignity is a much better word here) and I mentiond that I entirely understad
that. Basically, I would have visited, except that she was planning on coming
back to the house to shower and gather herself and work through an issue with
her Fidelity credit card and other such housekeeping things, as well as to
visit Kyle and Evan and Granny and Papa while they were all together at the
house, and so I decided that while she does all of that, it made the most sense
to me to forgoe the visit today, and make the visit tomorrow. I don't imagine
that my fathers condition will be any different tomorrow, but my mom
understands as I do that the visit is certainly not going to be a sociable one,
as all sense of modesty and visitation has entirely vanished as of late. She
mentioned something about the doctors wanting to give my father steroids to
stop the "turf war" as she called it between my dad's still fighting cells and
Evan's transfused cells, and apparently that turf war is still going on to an
effect that is beyond what they had hoped for, and if it continues this way
they will hope to give him steroids which will kill a lot of the transfused
cells so they really don't want to do that but they might have to. I don't know
how that all works, as I am not a doctor after all, but regardless, my father
is in poor condition, but that was to be expected, and all of these things are
tactics that go in to the strategy of making a bone marrow transplant.

Also, as I mentioned, my grandparents are in town, and they texted me yesterday
asking me if we wanted to go to the german restaurant, the Bavarian Grill, for
dinner. I replied that I had plans for the evening but I could go late, and
that worked for everyone, so I ended up eating with them yesterday evening. I
had a pleasent conversation with my grandfather on my mothers side (indeed, as
you probably know my father's father was dead before I was born and his mother
died of old age about five years ago now) about his experience learing french
late in life like he did. I asked him at what age he decided to try and learn
French, and he told me that it was around his retirement, which was around age
55 for him. Mostly I was interested in how fluent and conversational he was
able to get with it, and he said that he was never able to get to the point
where he was truly thinking in french, and he was always thinking in english
and translating to french in his head. However, he also said that he only took
a nine month course at Rice university, and that he only visited france and
became immersed in it for a few weeks. He mentioned an incident where the train
they were on was coming to a stop before their desired stop, and the announcer
got on in french, and he was able to determine from the announcements that
there was an accident on the rail further ahead, and that they were trying to
clear up the accident and that there would be another train coming for them in
45 minutes or whatever, and he was able to determine that all through great
concentration at that moment, and that was what he felt like the peak of his
french had gotten too. Regardless, it was a pleasent conversation, and we
ended up talking about language and some of their travels and a bunch of other
things.

More amusing at this dinner event, though, was the interaction of my
grandfather with the waiter there. When we were seated and the waiter got us
our order, I could tell that he was not very comfortable with his position, and
gathered that he was probably new. I had ordered water, and I consitently had
to ask him to refill the glass, which is generally something that they do just
as they are passing by, and I wouldn't have minded so much if the glass weren't
so small (it was probably only a 16 oz glass) and if the glass didn't have so
much ice in it and if I hadn't just came from Bikram class and been needing the
water in a bad way. I mention only to illustrate the noviceness of our waiter,
which I don't mind (indeed, I could give my opinion on the uncomfortableness I
feel when being treated and waited on, but that's an entirely different
discussion). So after we finish the meal, and Papa goes to pay for the check,
the waiter returns after a bit of time, and shows him the card. He mentions
that something went wrong and shows my grandfather the black thingy doogy magig
foldy thing whatever that is called, opening it to him showing what I can only
assume is a receipt that says the card was declined. However, my grandfather
was not to keen on taking the hint to read what was being said, and the waiter,
bless his heart, was trying his best to be discreet about the whole thing, said
something like "well, it seems the system hasn't taken the card". My
grandfather then asked, "well is it your system or the card" at which point the
waiter says "well it may have been a bit of both" to which I could only laugh
because at this point I am thinking that the card must have been declined, and
my grandfather gives him another card and as the waiter is walking away, my
grandfather raises his voice to be heard across the table asking "well, was the
card declined or did it just not get run through the system?" at which point
the waiter, in all his attempts to be discrete at that point, eventully fell
into his ineveitable annoucement across the table that the card had been
declined. Kyle and Evan my brothers got great amusement out of this of course,
and after the waiter ran the other card and it was accepted, and my grandfather
had called Fidelity and asked about the transaction and found that there was no
transaction that had been run through there system (indeed, I have later
guessed that there might be something going on on Fidelities end since my mom
was mentioning that she was having troubles with her card as well), when the
waiter got back, and he and my grandfather began exchanging words, the
conversation went something like "well it seems the card wasn't even run,
becaues I called fidelity and they said they had no record of the transaction"
to which the waiter replied that it could have been their network and that this
sort of thing has happened before, to which my grandfather replied, "well hose
your network." Well, I don't know what the fuck "hose your network" means, but
the waiter interpretted this to mean "how old's your network" and replied that
he wouldn't know as he as only been working here two months. At this my
grandfather ended up conceding a bit, and the waiter walked away after
apologizing very sincerely for what was probably the sixth time in five
minutes, and asked us if we would like anything before leaving, making eye
contact with me directly and asking me if I would like more water. I could do
nothing but smile and say "no thank you", and if I would have been on top of my
game I would have been able to make some witty remark about the callousness of
my grandfather in that moment, but I couldn't think of anything clever, and
indeed have not come up with anything clever that I could have said to lighten
the situation even in reflection (although my reflection hasn't been too deep).
Indeed, this waiter should have just been refilling my water glass without
asking my permission to do so, so he was clearly quite new to the whole thing
and was only so unfortunate to come across my grandfather and his hallowed
fidelity card, and as he walked away, rid of us and entirely done with our
table as the check was payed, my grandfather began to laugh. And as my
grandfather laughed, I couldn't help but let out a good laugh as well. Indeed,
seeing him laugh with his great big belly bouncing up and down with each heave
of his voice, as his abdominals contracted and curled him up involunarily into
a hunched position as his laugh got bigger and bigger and less and less
controlled only made me want to laugh even more, and I decided not to supress
it in that moment, and I myself had a great good laugh, the kind of laugh that
you just let out in the moment as I could only feel sympathy for the poor
waiter and understanding of my grandfathers frustration. Indeed, that laugh
came out of me not out of pity for the waiter, but instead at the way my
grandfather handled the entire situation, with the least amount of empathy and
understanding as possible. To see my grandfather interact with that waiter was
something straight out of a comedy, a shakespearean comedy, where the actors go
back and forth with the most absurd clash of personalities, the one being an
old man with a lot of money who would never have his card declined due to a
lack of funds, and the other a young kid just trying to make the best of a
situation and acting in the most timid way. Innocent aggression matches violent
timidness. How funny that was. And I could have supressed that laugh, but I had
no reason to, and certainly a small part of me was laughing with my
grandfather, as I certainly have seen a lot of that assholery behavior in
myself before, but more I was laughing at the perfect storm that was that
scene, and the escalation it came to (indeed, it wasn't even really escalated,
because I know my grandfather and I know his kindheartedness, but that waiter
certainaly had not seen that side of him), and I laughed simply at the fact
that the escalation could have been entirely avoided had my grandfather had
just a touch of empathy for the man, but he didn't, and that was only all too
amusing to me. So I let myself laugh at that scene.

Besides that, as we were leaving I was able to discuss the topic of my arrest
with Kyle, and was able to get his side of the whole thing, which was good to
hear, as he rode with me in my car back to the house, where we finished our
conversation and I made my way back to my apartment.

Indeed, I have to stop now (I am quite done anyway) and make my way to the
Roughnecks game. That's it for today.

# 20180701
So today it is now in the morning, where as yesterday it was the evening time,
like I said I would do in my article yesterday. In fact, I literally just woke
up, and I am still gathering myself as far as waking up and gathering my
senses. You might be able to tell by the lack of grace in my sentence
structure. Yeah, it's very stilted, as if I don't know what I want to talk
about, and I am simply just writing words for the sake of writing words. So be
it, words are fun to write anyway, although it is quite interesting, I can tell
that my writing is much slower than it usually is. I'm not sure if this is
because I am just waking up, or if it is because I have nothing to say.

I do actually have something to say, and I thought about writing about this
last night after I came back from the Roughnecks game, but I didn't and instead
spent my time trying and failing to go to sleep as I wholly decided I wanted to
read anything and everything that I came across, jumping from literary work to
work, even reading various synopses on wikipedia to see if I want to read them,
before finally coming to a mindless hearthstone tournament to ease my mind. I
have this idea for my lit anaylzer, as well as ideas for my workout logger, and
both of those projects have been neglected by me as of late, so I might end up
writing out my ideas for each of those and getting to work on them, and making
one of them my project for the day/evening. Regardless, lets go back to the
events of my life.

Last night I know I had a dream, and I remember having a sort of moment when I
woke up in the night, but not entierly woke up but just that half awake half
not awake at all state that you arrive at sometimes, and in this state I
remember trying to keep in my head some detail about this dream, but even at
the time I remember thinking that it wasn't worth remembering and that the
dream was wholly short and entirely boring, so I don't remember what happened.
If I had a nice dream, similar to the Seattle dream I had a few days ago, then
perhaps this whole, "wake up and start writing immediately" thing would feel
more natural, but as of right now it feels like I am simply writing for the
sake of it without getting anywhere. Although I do say, now that it is a few
minutes past getting into it, and I am beginning to wake up a little better,
this is starting to flow a little better. Actually, I think I will decide to
take a shower, go outside for a bit, collect myself, and think about what I
might want to write about, and come back and continue writing. Yes, let's do
that. I will return.

-

So I am back now from my walk, which took me about 30 minutes in total to
complete, and I am back and I have a few things I want to talk about.

The first is, I think I am spreading myself a little thin as far as my hobbies
and interests are concerned, and I have been having a hard time finding the
time to do all the things I want to do, and I am not making strategic choices
as to what to sacrifice. That whole point my lie wholey in that statement right
there, but I had this sort of strong feeling about it as I was nearing the end
of my walk, as I was talking to myself about my felony, which was the primary
topic of conversation on my walk. The second has to do with my feeling of out
of place ness at the Roughnecks game, which also might have the whole of the
idea expressed in that statement right there.

So I am definintely being spread thin as far as all the things I want to do,
and I very much ran in to this last night as I was reading from so many
different books and things. I have so many great ideas of things I want to
write and program about, but it seems as though by the time I end up doing
them, I get lost in them, and begin working on them, it's time for bed, and
it's back to the whole grind of work, sleep, eat, train, yoga, repeat, which is
why my work life is beginning to suffer, as that is the path of least
resistance for me right now. At least, it will be the path of least resistance
until I get fired, at which point finding a job will be the path of least
resistance, I think, unfortunately. So with all of that, one can imagine why I
don't want to dedicate myself to a girlfriend, as that would just be one more
additional thing that would occupy my time, and I don't want that.

I would like to brainstorm about the various things I want to continue on with
for my projects, so before I do that I do want to touch on breifly the game
yesterday. The game was a wholly boring game. The wind was a bit strong, not so
strong that the concept of throwing upwind was entirely impossible, but enough
to the point where upwind and downwind scores were just as important a
consideration as breaks and holds, so the way the game ended up going was the
Roughnecks went up by five or six and then proceeded to trade downwind points
with Austin Sol through the third quarter when I left. I sat in my two typical
corners, which were on the downwind side of the field, but even there there
wasn't much to see. The one thing I will say is that I was very impressed by
Steven Borik's play, and he is doing great things for himself for the team. He
was a defensive handler for the team, and he did a very damn good job at it,
finding holes and punching in upwind bombs that you would expect from any calm,
collected, seasoned veteran. I made eye contact with Falkor as I was walking by
the stands, and he made eye contact with me, and that was it. Not even a smile
or anything, just eye contact. I made a smile and a raise of the eyebrows,
which was not returned, so I guess that is the level of our interaction now. I
will surely make comment of it if we ever to stop to talk to eachother on the
field, but unless that happens I'll just let it be for now. I liked him, but I
think he very much looks down on me and has become a bit of a douche now
because of his acheivments in ulitmate, and that's cool with me. I don't
particularly care. Besides that, I ran across Jack who was coming back from Two
Finger, which I didn't realize was this weekend, so we crossed paths as he was
coming in and I was leaving, and shared a pleasent exchange, so that was the
only real redeeming quality of the game yesterday. So enough of that.

So I want to talk about my productivity now. There are two primary projects
which, when I have them under control, will I feel go long ways to increseing
my productivity, and both of those projects are my workout logger, and my
literary analyzer, and on both of them I am just a little bit stuck as to what
I want to do with them. The lit analyzer I have tried to work on a few times,
but I have always gotten stuck at this one aspect of it, and that aspect is the
concept of how exactly do I want to expose the structure of a work? Everytime I
think I find the best way to do something, I think of a better way to do it,
but then when I think about doing it that way, I find reasons why my first way
was better, and I am sort of stuck in this loop of "well how the fuck do you
want to represent literature anyway you asshole?" One consistent piece that has
remained constant throughout, and a piece that I want to keep, is that of
organizing the entire thing into a tree like structure. However, I always run
in to opposing ideas of how to parse the whole of the work into said structure.
What I am doing at this point, is I am putting the authors imposed structure,
being the chapter, and book and section deliniations, all as implicitly part of
the tree (and indeed, this has to be done in order to break the source material
into smaller files, otherwise the entire thing would be too difficult to
manipulate in Vim without becoming annoyed at the unweildiness of the file, so
there are practical reasons for this), but I have noticed sections where
chapters will come to a sort of cliffhanger and the cliffhanger will be
resolved at a later point in the story, even across chapters (Clancy or Dan
Brown or other writers would have this problem for sure), so while the concept
of dividing up my files into chapters for ease of reading is one I want to
keep, when it comes to analyzing the whole of the work, it doesn't make as much
sense to me to keep the author's impossed structure.

So lets go back to a Clancy novel, and use that as a framework for how I want
to analyze this. Let's reduce a novel down into it's simplest forms. A Clancy
novel will generally have multiple threads running through the thing. So in the
prologue, Clancy will kick of his threads, usually three or four of them, and
in doing will then set the stage for the different, at first disconnected
stories that end up coming into eachother. I've had this sort of idea last
night, that each thread would be it's own independent thing, and that it will
contain a list of events that are a part of the thread, but already I run in to
the problem what the best way to represent all of this would be. Take the Lord
of the Rings for instance. I could have Frodo's thread be sepearte from Sam's
thread, even though for the most part they are always together, they do
seperate for part of the novel, and they have different concerns and such
throughout the novel. But this is the problem I run into (and this is perhaps
the questions that I have been asking myself in my head but not making
explicit), is when Sam and Frodo are having dialogue together, what parts of
the dialog go into Sam's thread and which parts of the dialog go in to Frodo's
thread? One method of resolving this would be to say "any time Frodo is
talking, it goes in to Frodo's thread, and any time Sam is talking it goes into
Sam's thread," but I don't like this idea for the reason that, if the whole of
the thread is something like "Sam and Frodo travel through Mordor towards Mount
Doom where they plan to destroy the ring" then the dialog between Sam and Frodo
would all go through that thread, but when Sam and Frodo seperate, it would
have be to be different threads. And that is the problem, is I don't know how
broad I want these threads to be. I have this concept of being able to split at
thread into to, so a thread might have all of the dialog between Sam and Frodo,
and then when Sam is seperated from Frodo, that would create a split in the
thread, and when they are reunited, the thread comes back together, and there
is that way of representing it, so in that way a thread would be something that
has a list of primary actors, and a thread is something approaching more of an
event than an overaching thread. Indeed, in this way, one thread might contain
the events of the fellowship from Loth Lorien to Emyn Muil, and then that
thread would end there, and the we'd have new threads for Merry and Pippen,
Aragorn Gimli and Legolas, and Frodo and Sam, and then the Merry and Pippen
thread would combine with the Aragorn and Gimli and Legolas thread when they
meet back up, which would be a new thread there, and so on, and one can imagine
how this would go. What I don't like about this is, suppose I wanted to
extract Frodo's journey to Mordor out of these threads, I would simply find all
of the threads that contain Frodo, and say that that is Frodo's thread, but
then that thread would contain all of the dialog of the fellowship between say
Aragorn and Boromir, and while Frodo is there for that dialog, he is not a part
of it in any way, so again I am at a loss as to the best way to do this, and I
go back and forth as to how this should be represented.

So at this point I think it is important to take a step back and reconsider my
purpose in these threads in the first place. The whole purpose of this idea of
threads is to bring myself to be able to rewrite the whole of the novel in a
different order, or just extract the excerpts that have certain symbolism, or
certain other ideas. So in this way, the concept of annotations is a much more
useful one. However, then I run in to a different problem, and that is the
difference between a reference an actor in an event. So suppose I want to
extract every excerpt regarding Sauron. There are so many references to Sauron
throughout the LOTR, but he takes part in very few events. Pippen sees him in
the Palantir, as does Aragorn, but besides that he is only referenced by the
characters more than anything. Sauron is not the best example though, lets take
Gandalf. What I am getting at, if I want to find the path of Gandalf through
the Lord of the Rings, should that include the references to him? For instance,
I know surely (okay, not surely, but I'm pretty sure) that Frodo at least
thinks about him as he and Sam and Gollum travel there way to Mount Doom, but
the event "Frodo ties the elven rope around Gollum and it burns him" should not
contain Gandalf in it even if Frodo does make a mention to him. Gandalf is
being refernced, but that event would not be included in the path that Gandalf
takes through the lord of the Rings. However, Gandalf should definitely be
included as an annotation in that scene, and this is where my problem lies.
Indeed, perhaps this concept of thread is one of those concepts that nears the
mark, but needs to be re-imagined in a different way, similar to how clever
mathmeticians just simply have to think about a problem very hard in order to
solve it.

--

So I think at this point I have three concepts which encapsulate everything I
want to capture in my system. The first, and most specific, is that of the
speaker, which would be the lowest most base form of an excerpt. The second is
the idea of an event, which would be composed of multiple of these speakers,
and would have multiple actors. So the event, "Gandalf tells the council about
the betrayal of Saruman" would be an event, but "Saruman's betrayal" would not
be, since we never have dialog which tells about the betrayal of Saruman in
real time, only Gandalf's recollection of it. I'm not sure if Saruman would be
considered an actor in that event or not, I haven't decided yet. The last is
the concept of character reference, and I think the best way to reconcile this
would be to have a list of tags that the system looks for for a character. This
could be done in the form of [brackets] like this one. So in Harry Potter,
everytime "He who must not be named" is mentioned, I could put [Voldemort] in
brackets next to the name. It would be implied that the brackets are added by
me. To find all of these references, the use of regular expressions would be
used to scrape the raw data, and one could imagine a function that takes in the
regular expression input and returns every reference in the source (as the base
level of source), or returns every event that Voldemort is mentioned in, and
also every event that Voldemort is an actor in.

So every event would have a list of actors (and these actors need not even have
dialog, it could just be known that they were there) but every source has one
speaker. I'm not sure how unweildy this would get, trying to mark out every
time the speaker changes in my work, but it could be done. The events are what
are imposed into a tree like structure, and I find it neccesary to require that
leaves of events could be applied in non-sequential order. That is, I could
have an event like, "the gang discuss their plans" and "the villian creeps
closer to the gangs hideout", and in the case that the author wants to create
suspense by writting about the villian creeping closer to the hideout
interwoven in the dialog about the gang discuss their plans, I could still by
forcing some sub events be a part of the first parent event, and some sub
events being a part of the second parent event.

When it comes to thinking about these things, I think I have to take a top-down
(breadth first) approach to these events. So a first level event would be
something that spans the entire novel (Frodo's journey through middle earth vs
Aragorn's ascension to kingship), and each of these events would have their sub
events. This is the part where I am still having the hardest time imagining
what this is like in my head, as both of those bigger events would contain
overlaping sub-events, which is a concept I have not been able to capture in my
annotations and notes so far, so I'm still struggling with finding the best way
to represent this.

So after taking a bit of a walk on this, while I still haven't totally
reconciled how this will go in full, I have gotten quite a bit closer. I like
the idea of using brackets (which, when I acheive a certain level of
cleverness, I will be able to generate using vim scripts and autocompletion to
allow for easy night time reading) to represent speakers. Every source will
have a speaker. An event will be a list of sources. (Also note that I have the
freedom to break up one source by the same speaker as I see fit. This will
become helpful when someone goes on at length about something, and at the very
end of their monologue, they ask a question which fits in an entirely different
event. So I could annotate with brackets something like [speaker:Aloysha] for
his monologue, and then break up his monologue with [speaker:Aloysha] again
when the tone of his conversation changes as I deem appropiate). Once I have
these events, I then think that the best course of action will be to have a way
to combine events to this tree structure. I also want to have the notion that
one source can go into multiple events, and also the notion that one event can
go into multiple parent events as well.

With this concept well formed in my head, I think it will be best if I continue
to read Mistborn and break down that story in this way. That story is
complicated enough to warrent this sort of analysis but not so complicated that
I will get confused as to what I am doing and why.

So today I don't have much to say. I did have a dream last night, but it was
mostly uninteresting, since when I tried to go to sleep in one location, I had
my watch with the alarm for BJJ on it, but I could not go to sleep in that
location because I just couldn't, so I went into my bedroom but didn't take the
watch with me, so the dream was mostly about dreaming that it was a different
time than it was, and I actually woke up at 3 o'clock after my dream self had
convinced myself that it was past 7 o'clock. I knew as soon as I woke up that
it couldn't be 7, and I checked the time and it was indeed 3, so I did some
quick sleep math and determined I had two more sleep cycles, so I went back to
sleep and proceded to have a dream where I created an absurdly massive joint,
scraping off a bunch of weed (and dust) from a shelf onto a big sheet of
butcher paper, and the entire dream was so absurd that I didn't even smoke the
joint but just made it into two pieces and that was that. It was very strange,
and I honestly don't even know how to roll a joint so the entire thing was
quite absurd. I woke up knowing how absurd it was, so I am glad that at least I
didn't wake up thinking I had smoked some weed like I have in the past.

I will say I will be glad when this First Drug Offender Program gets started,
because at this point I still have temptations (not to the point of acting on
them, but to the point of amusing myself with them idly and subconciously as my
thought will drift) since I don't know when the first time I am going to have
to piss in a cup is, and it could very well be more than a month from now, at
which point I could smoke weed right now if it weren't for my own self enforced
probation. Obviously I am not going to, but I imagine that as long as my
thoughts are able to entertain the idea that I could do it and probably get
away with it, I will probably continue to have dreams like this, which is
unfortanate, but it is just how it is.

I visited my father on Sunday. He is doing a lot better than he was on
Thursday. His fever has gone down, his diarehha has gone down, and while he is
still certainly not anywhere close to recoverd from this thing, it seems like
the worst of it is over. The climax has been acheived and at this point it is
falling action. We didn't talk about much. I told him about our experince at
the Bavarian Grill, which he got a good kick out of, and we talked about other
things in between when the nurse was coming in and out and applying blood
transfusions. The most notable thing is, as I was approaching getting ready to
leave (and this is something that I will have to remember in the future, a sort
of trick for handling emotionally driven moments, to have them towards the end
of a conversation when arrangments require that one party leave at that
moment), he brought up our relationship, mentioning that as a child he was
always told to do things on his own, and he felt that he wanted to give us the
opposite, to do things for us, because he never anyone do anything for him.
Now, of course, I had thought about these things before, but never had I
thought about his reasoning for doing all of the things before, that it was
because he never had things done for him, and that he felt strongly that he
needed to provide that for us, and he mentioned the time he changed my spark
plugs without me there, and he said that he knew that it frosted me, and that
he didn't know it would frost me so. And he apologized for it, and as I was
driving away I thought about how I handled that moment. I could have handled it
a little better, but at the same time I didn't want to just say "I forgive you"
because that is too much like he is the only one at fault and I am applying my
forgivness as some hypocritical saint, so I said something like "well I have
known these things and thought about them, and though I knew them in my head I
was too bitter to be okay with them (or something equally unweildy) but I don't
fault you for it. You did a good job. You are doing a good job." and I was
speaking softly, so he didn't catch the last bit, and asked me to repeat it, so
I did. And then we shared our goodbyes I held his hand, which didn't have as
much strength as it has had before but still had some, and as I walked out I
said something like "I would tell you to keep getting better but I don't think
I have to tell you that" to which he replied that no indeed, I didn't have to
tell him that, and I made my leave. I don't recall if I said I love you (and
the fact that I can't recall that indicates to me that I didn't because I would
recall that if I did) and I remember thinking that I could have applied my
forgivness, or rather applied my past forgiveness again, to that situation a
little better, but still that I felt that it was a nice moment between us. Nice
moment indeed.

I also mentioned that lately, as this thing has been approaching it's climax, I
have felt a stronger inclination to visit, and that I'm not sure where it comes
from, but at the end there of our conversation I said that it eases my heart to
see him, and indeed it does ease my heart to see him, and I am glad that I said
that in that way. I thought about this, how it could be a selfish thing, and
again I go on about being selfish here, but I meant it in an entirely unselfish
way, and only just afterwards realized that it might be selfish, and so I can
say that it could in no way be meant as selfish. It is one of those things that
should only be said once though, I think for this very reason, because that
statement is in a since selfish, as if I am only visiting him to ease my own
heart, so I will not say it again, or at least I do not see myself seeing a
situation where it would be appropiate to say it again. Maybe such a situation
exists, but I can't forsee it so I think it is something that will be said once
and not again, at least not in relation to visiting him during this time.

I want to jump directly now to the short story that I have not brought myself
to finish yet. It is rather a peculiar thing, that I feel as though that I
should only write it when I feel so inspired, and that I shouldn't touch it
otherwise. Indeed, what would be the harm in writing for it, only to entirely
discard it and write it again when I feel so inspired? Would there be great
harm in writing a sub par draft of the ending of the story? I don't think so,
especially since I have a very sub par draft of the beginning of the story, and
a subpar draft of the ending would be only appropiate. I guess this comes to
the point of making my writing speak in volume rather than require there to be
consistent quality every time I sit to strike keys on the keyboard. Indeed, if
the concept of writing out some thousand words of a story that I am working on
become a routine ordeal, and the concept of constanly weeding through and
editing and finding structure in that which was written is one that I want to
make part of my writing, then I think for sure I should entirely dismiss this
idea of having my first draft be good, and instead simply sit down and write
for the story without concern for whether on not I will be satisfied with what
I write.

Still though, this particular story I have such a fondness for, as I
feel as though it is not my own story but instead entirely inspired by
something apart from me. Indeed, I don't know if I still have the original
recording, but I don't remember anything about the inspiration or motivation
for that original recording, and I have no idea where the idea came from. I can
only imagine being so high in my room, thinking about my nihilistic thoughts,
and coming up with this story to directly express them.

What I love about this story is that it has only three characters, the Dragon,
the King, and the People, each entirely different, each with different
motivations and motives and all of that, with different reasons for doing what
they do. In fact, this is the first story with characters that I have felt
don't neccesarrily fit into a mold like my other characters do (since I am very
much not a character person). The king is very much a part of me, but the
dragon and the people both represent ideas that are very much not a part of me.
Indeed, I don't empathize with the people, and I don't empathize with the
dragon. Instead, they are concepts, reflections, of what I think those
characters should be like.

At the point I am in the story right now I have just written up the ritual, and
I was interrupted (I had to go to yoga) at the point where the dragon was
summoned, and the people began to tell the dragon of their plight. I do not
believe I have written it yet, but I want the people to tell the dragon about
their problems, and for the dragon to insist on leading the people in the kings
place. I want this to be almost forced, I want there to be a sense of fear in
the people which is invoked, and I want the dragon to insist that this is the
way it must be. I have a line in my head "For what reason would you come all
the way to this pilgramage, to summon that which you have fear of and request
guidance from, if you are not to listen and obey when that has spoken?" I want
to liken this to some myth right now, but maybe I have been reading to much
epic poetry and should leave the references out of it.

So I want to get this down before I forget it. This dream I had last night was
not too spectacular, but it is definitely worth writing down and setting off my
thoughts for this journal article with, as I feel there is definitely something
in it. Before I talk about the dream though, I want to say a little bit about
my night. So last night was what I would consider an ideal night. I went to bed
promptly after stuffing myself full of a turkey sandwich and a PBJ, along with
what must have been over a half a gallon of milk, before I laid down to rest
with my full stomach and my tablet. I woke up around four o'clock, which would
have been a good five cycles of sleep, all dreamless to my recollection. When I
woke, I got up and played the second part of the opus whatever it is of
Chopin's nocturnes in F minor and Eflat major, and I promptly decided that I
don't particularly care for this set and have elected to print out another to
occupy myself at the night like this. The second one is interesting, but I
don't have any emotion to it. I do find it neccesary to associate myself, or at
least become familiar with this sort of disconcordant harmony which I have
subconsciously stayed away from in the past simply due to the fact that it is
unfamiliar to me, but I quite like the sound of it when it is played well, and
I would like to familiarize myself with it so that I can better parse it and
understand it, so that my understanding of music as a whole will become more
enlightened as I continue on this path of neglecting my worldly
responsibilities in favor of indulgence in these fine arts. After I was
finished with that nocturne, I then went back towards the reading of the Grand
Inquisator of the Brother's Karamazov, and though I found it extremely lengthy
and unneccesarily archaic (at least the tranlsation by Garnett is so), it had a
cool little punch at the end, I liked the climax, even though I knew how it
was, but mostly I like where it fits in the story, rising tension happening
everywhere, and even so our characters are able to discuss this matter of
philosophy as if it is more important than all of the rising action that is
going on up to this point. Quite interesting indeed, if not a little pompous,
but the author makes note of this pompousness quite explictly, so it can be
excused as it is excused by the author himself.

But all of this has nothing to do with the dream I had that followed. Like most
of my dreams, I don't remember much of this one except that it had to do with
Crossfit. This Crossfit setting is different than the ones I've had in the
past. This one was a rather small gym, one story on the surface level (not the
one with the basement that I usually associate with Crossfit competition) with
one opening that faces west. And the fact that it faces west I know to be true,
or at least, I know that the direction the opening faces I strongly associate
with Left. This gym is much smaller than the big with with the pullup rig that
goes all around it in a square with two openings, this one is shaped rather in
two sort of rectangle areas, each connected, the northern one being more like a
square, and the southern one being more like a rectangle. And in the square
area, as will become relevent in the dream, there are two sets of pull up
rigs, one that is more reachable, and another that one would have to climb up
in some way to get to. However, the person on the upper pull up rig in the
dream is simply up there, and I did not think of how he got up there or how I
or anyone would get up there in order to use it, rather it was just a feature
of the gym that you could get up there and that it was completely normal. What
I remember about this gym is walking in, and talking with the owner. How I knew
he was the owner, I don't know, but he was and I knew it because it was a dream
and you just know these sorts of things in dreams. I don't remember the
conversation I had with the owner, but I do remember that it mostly involved me
asking him some questions, questions about his gym and such, and that the
nature of these questions was that I was asking him as if quizing him, not
because I had questions that I wanted answered for myself, but because I wanted
the answers from him so I could learn his answers. These are the sorts of
questions that I would ask (and have asked) Crossfit box owners about their box
in order to size them up. I then transitioned to talking about the workout we
would do for the day, to which he defered me to one of the others in the gym. I
must remind you that this gym was quite small, so while we were talking in the
southern part of the gym, there were two others who were working out in the
northern part, and the four of us brought the gym to its highest comfortable
capacity. Surely there could have been more in the gym to work out, but any
more than the four of us would have made the gym feel croweded. So I take a few
steps over to the other section of the gym, and I ask one of them what the
workout of the day is. The two people were already in the act of working out,
but not "doing a workout" or "WOD" as crossfiters would say, but instead doing
working sets and resting in between. So the person on the lower set of the
pullup rig, who was in between sets, begins to describe to me the workout that
they are doing, and the first thing he says is that it involves ninety pullups.
At this I inturupt him, saying that I am meant to do ninety pullup per round?
in a questioning way, because I knew this was supposed to be a very metcony
workout, and I knew that though I would be able to complete whatever workout
they threw my way, I also knew that ninety pullups per round would work much
more of a muscular endurance aspect of the movement rather than the breathing
heavy aspect, so I asked him something like "really, ninety pullups per round
or do you mean something else?" And then he replied something like, "well yeah,
we do things seriously here." which didn't answer my question at all, and I
immediately dismissed him as a foolish meathead who only concerned himself with
big numbers and used that to determine the quality of his workouts. The person
on the higher pull up rig, who was on top of it, who had overheard our
conversation (and how could he not, he was right there), then replies that no,
it's not ninety pullups per round, but instead nine pullups at the start of
each round, making a total of ninety. I then thanked him, and entirely
dismissed the first athelete, and focused my attention on this other one,
saying, "Okay, so describe to me the workout, it is 10 rounds of nine
pullups..." and I left the statement hanging there as if he were to finish it,
but then he did not. Now, I cannot remember if he went back to his workout, but
I think what happened is they both became a touch confused the first one more
so and the one on the rig I think more amused than anything, and this was near
the end of the dream, so I never got what the other movements of this workout
were meant to be, and I certainly didn't get to the point where I was ready to
start it. And that is where the dream ended.

I also find it pertinant to say that I did have some sleep paralysis at some
point in the night as well. I don't remember at what point in the timeline of
the night I had this paralysis, but it was accopanied by hallucinations again,
which now that I am aware that I do indeed hallucinate during my sleep
paralysis, I am made aware of the fact that the people I am imagining coming
into my room are not real, and I was able to rest easier and almost enjoy the
feeling of paralysis. Yes, enjoy is the word I would use. And in order to
justify my use of that word I should say a bit about yesterday.

Yesterday was a rough day for me. Currently I have been assigned a programming
case which I am not quite sure at all what to do with, and instead of working
on it I continued to work on learning Russian (which I think I have finally
narrowed in on a couple of primary resources I want to use, as well formulated
my conception of how I want to help myself learn vocabulary, so the hours I
spent yesterday, though they felt in vain a bit, were acutally quite fruitful
in my whole endeavor) and writing the story of the King and the Dragon, and
doing all sorts of other unproductive things, unproductive in relation to my
work at least, and I began to feel quite guilty of it all. That, coupled with
the empty stomach (I had not eaten enough the night before) and the feeling of
tiredness (which I blamed on the fact that the people of Alliant take great
concern in me taking a twenty minute nap during the afternoon, which I can
understand their jealousy of, but we would all be better off if we could take
such naps) led to a rather shitty late afternoon, which was only redeemed what
I was able to steal a nap during the spine strengthening series of Bikram Yoga
which I dread so much. I really hate the poses involved in the spine
strengthening series, I think they are silly and dumb and I don't like them,
which they would say indicates that they are the poses that I need the most,
but I disagree, saying instead that I would much rather work shoulder related
poses in that time as my shoulders need so much more opening than my spine
needs strengthening, and the soreness I feel in my back come entirely from that
god-awful series. I digress. The point is that I had a rough day yesterday, and
in reflection of that day I determined that it was mostly caused by lack of
sleep and lack of food, both of which are things that are in my control and
both of which are things that I neglected the night before, the food much more
so than the sleep as, though I know certain things that hinder sleep, I don't
have quite as much control over that aspect than I do the ability to jam food
in my mouth.

And that is why I say I could enjoy the sleep paralysis. Once I knew the
hallucinations, I was able to determine, by looking at my door, that indeed it
was shut, and the going in and out of my room that I thought I heard was indeed
hallucination. Indeed, if I describe the hallucinations as if I thought they
were real, I thought that what I saw was someone entering and exiting my
apartment, I heard the door opening and closing (and since I forget at what
point in the night these hallucinations happened, it is plausible, though I
think not likely that these door sounds could have been real), and I heard
speaking, as if there were someone talking to someone else as one worker would
talk to another about the work they are doing, and I thought I even saw the
figure of someone over my box which I am sleeping behind right now. However, I
was able to look over to the corner of my door, and I saw that the sound of the
door opening and closing was not accompanied by my door actually opening and
closing, so using this I was able to determine that the hallucinations were not
real and I was able to let myself rest there more soundly. In fact, I at that
point attempted to embrace the feeling of paralysis, because even though I know
the ways to bring myself out of the paralysis when it happens (focusing on the
breath is the biggest one, and ensuring that it goes in and out in deep full
breaths) I knew that the paralysis was a good thing. I knew that it wasn't time
to wake up and that I wanted to continue to sleep, so I embraced the paralysis,
and was glad in it. And that feeling of paralysis suddenly felt pleasurable. It
was the kind of pleasure one feels on the toungue when you place a tasty bit of
food on it, but instead of simply feeling it on the tongue I felt it throughout
my entire being (since the body is paralyzed, the concept of feeling a
sensation at a certain part of the body is gone entirely, so that all of your
sensation is the sensation of your being rather than the sensation of any
particular nerve). This sensation was not pleasure, in the traditional sense,
like one might think of orgasm though, instead this was the feeling one gets
when you lay in your bed and you know you should get up, but you don't, except
instead of having the ability to get up and feeling all of your limbs be heavy,
you don't feel heavy limbs but instead feel as though you are just a spirit in
space. This feeling can be very scary, especially if you try and resist it and
attempt to move your limbs (which I remind you are paralyzed), but once I was
able to accept it and realized that it was the feeling that I wanted to
embrace, I was able to embrace it, and then I returned to sleep.
