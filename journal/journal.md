So this  is a story all about how my life got twist turned upside down and I'd
like to take a minute just sit right there I'll tell youa all about how I
became the fresh prince of bel air.

So for real though, what I want to be able to do is take my stream of
conscousness and transmit it directly onto this machine. That way, I can do
things like write blogs and journal articles and diary entries and all sorts of
stuff. and not have to thkni about what is going on beneath my fingers. So
yeah, when I g et to that point, it will be a good day, I can feel as though I
am getting close to that point, but it is really just a meter of time before I
totally get there. It's difficult to do, and it takkes a lot of practice. I lke
doing it though, it's just a matter of doing so in a way where I stay
comfortable.. I will say, I do not lke the way this keyboard I am uisng is so
slanted to the left. I want to get a 69% keyboard at some point, but I haven't
done my research on twhere to find them and how much they cost and cet etc. .

Regardless, there are a few things I want to say, The first thing is that I
think Ros Namajunes is one of the most gorgeous individuals I have ever met.
Like, absolutely stunning individual. It's absurd really. And I mean that in
the least sexual way possible. In fact, I would go so far te say that my
thoughts about rose are such that I would remove any feeling of sex about her
because that really obscures the kind of human being she is. She is so beautful
in so many ways, it's quite amazing to be honest.

To start, she is an amazing fighter. She cut her hair for practicality reasons,
she doesn't wear heels because it doesn't make sense for her to, she wears
loose pants and comfortable shooes.Everything about her is absolutely spot on.
She has the most genuine heart, the strongest soul of any individual I have
seen, and speaks with the most sincerity for herself and the poule around her
and the human race as a whole. I am absolutely blown away by her heart and her
soul, and her mind, and her body. Everything about this human being is
stunning. 

That only scatches the surface too. She eembodies everything that is good in
the world, and her charcter is what everyone should be actively seeking every
day to what she seekxs. It's in that constant search for the best version of
ourselves that we find the best version of ourselves. But only for glimpses.
The window into the soul is always dynamic, and one should always understand
how that window lies in with reality.

So I am getting to a point in my life where I feel like my life is becoming a
really interesting story, a story that will be worth telling in perhaps
autobiographical format at some point. However, and this is a difficulty that I
have had in the past with my tale of Delita, and that is my memory of things is
not quite clear on certain details of the story that can sometimes be very
relevent to how things play out. And even if my memory is totally correct, the
act of actively trying to conjure up memories of things that happened even just
two years in the past is proving to be difficult, and one can only imagine that
conjuring up memories like this is sure to have so hindsight 20 20 glasses
going on, so this is my attempt to acheive a few things.

One, I want to write more. I have just gotten to the point where I can think
words in dvorak and they come out onto my fingers in pretty quick pace, so I
want to harness that and really make my typing ability become ingrained into my
subconscious so that I can really reap the benefits of switching keyboard
layouts. On top of that, I want to get used to the idea of writing down things
that might seem very long or very perhaps even cumbersome, but when read back
don't take very long to read. That is something I have noticed is that, when I
write, I write in very consice thoughts, and I'm afriad to venture to far on
tangents because when you write a tangent, it seems like you are on that
tangent for a very long time because writing take a very long time to do in
comparison to thinking or reading, but when you read it back it feels
disjointed because I don't stay on those tangents for very long, and the reader
is left to wonder why the writer is constanly cutting all of his tangents
short. It makes it seem as though I want to say something but that I am
constantly going back to the thing I stemmed from, which, like I said, creates
very disjointed and disorienting writing.

The second, is that I want to remember these things, my feelings, emotions,
thoughts, and etc, as they are still fresh in my memory. This journal is not
intended as a thereputic tool (although, surely it can be used as such in
certain times, and any journal and writing in general is always in a way
thereputic) but instead as a reflective one, a tool I can use to create a sort
of imprint of my emotions, of my actions, and of the events that happen to me
and those around me. I want this to be a sort of picture, a video of my life,
but this is better than a video because the reader consuming this medium has
access to the inner thoughts and emotions that go on inside of my head, where
as a consumer of video would have to infer that from the video being watched.
In a way, it is worse because the truth can be distorted through the lens of my
writing, but I will do my best to keep this metaphorical mirror as flat and
clean as possible, perhaps even making note of the places where the mirror may
be smudged or distorted so that the reader will know when something that is
being written is my perception of the truth rather than the raw unfiltered
facts of what happened.

So all of that out of the way, this first article will be a bit of a doozy, and
will be uncharacteristic of what I want this to be. What I want this to be is
my thoughts and emotions of the events of the day before, written in the
morning of the following day, in a way that puts the context of the day before
into my philosophical musings of this current day. However, I feel it neccesary
to start today with a whole background of what has happened to me over the past
8 months, since the day I got that phone call from my mother that my father was
diagonosed with Luekemia. But then that goes against the spirit of what I just
said, as if I went over that past 8 months, I would be conjuring up feelings
and emotions over those 8 months rather than reflecting on my current thoughts
and feelings of what is going on right now, so I am left in a bit of a quandry.
I think the best way to resolve this is to simply start at the start where I am
right now, and to go over the background of other things in my life before this
journal was started as they seem appropiate. So let's do that.

So I am currently section 2 part 1 chapter 1 of "The Brothers Karamazov".
Currently I have two translations of that novel by, one being the etext version
that I make annotiations in, translated by Constance Garrett, and the other is
the "everyman edition" or some such, that I bought at the store some weeks ago,
and is another translation by two individuals who I forget their names at the
moment. I have also just recently, this past weekend (so 4 days ago now) bought
a tablet to read on, and I have been reading on this tablet for the past few
days now, and I am liking that method quite a lot.

All of that preface to say, the themes and motivations of those characters, and
the events that happen to them, greatly remind me a lot of the various aspects
of myself. I read (I think on reddit somewhere) that when Dicken's and
Dostoeyevsky met (or maybe they didn't meet, and Dos. was simply commenting on
Dicken's words) Dickens said that he feels that he has two people inside of
him, always at opposition to eachother, and that each of these two people
together makes up the whole of who he is as a person, to which Dos. replied
"only two?" Indeed, I feel quite the same way as the Russian in this respect,
and I can see this sort of notion in a very crystal clear sort of way expressed
in the Brothers K. I very much have inside myself an Aloysha, but I also have
inside of me a Dmitri, and as much as I don't want it to be the case (and I
think most everyone would agree on this point) I have a bit of Fyodor in me as
well.

And to get to the point I am really trying to make, in the story right now,
the action is rising, Mitya has stomped the head in of his father, and Aloysha
is acting as a mediator between all of the crucial characters of the novel
(which creates a very cool dynamic of the story) and at the end of the day, as
Aloysha goes back to the monestary to rest for the night, he learns that Father
Zossima, his mentor and perhaps his true father figure in the story (if you
insist on analyzing it as such), is in poor health and will indeed come to his
death in the very near future. Aloysha, knowing this, talks about how he feels
his place is in the monestary, with the father, and that all other wordly
responsibities don't matter in comparison to the illness of this Zossima.

This feeling is much similar to the feeling I feel right now. Currently, two
days ago, my little brother Evan has finished his donation of stem cells, and
the process of transplanting the cells into my father (excuse my crudeness in
terms here, there is surely a much more elegent and scientific way of saying
this) has just begun. My father was admitted into UTSouthwestern a week ago,
where he was administered chemeo in some amount throughout the week in
preperation of this transfusion. This is a sort of end cap on the entire
process that has gone on for the past 8 months, my father having had 8
treatment of chemeo in that, along with regular appointments, spinal taps, and
other things which I feel guilty not knowing the full details of. And it is at
this end cap that I have this feeling that my place is with my father. I have
this feeling for two reasons, one being scarier than the other. The first
reason is because I feel that this process is difficult, and that as much
support as my father can get can only help, and that it is my responibility to
give him that support. The second, scarier reason, is that my father may die in
this process, and if he does, that means that there are things about our
relationship that I can never right. That is the scarier thing.

And that is where I come at this weird conflicting feelings. Obviously, the
death of my father is a scary thing, and any reasonable sane person when asked
if they would be okay with the event of the death of a their father would
obviously say they would rather their father not die, and that they would
prefer if he would keep on living. However, my emotions in this instance are
different, and are something I have been struggling with pretty much ever since
he was diagonsed. You see, what worries me more about his death is not the
actual grief of his death itself (although for sure I know I will experience at
least some grief, even if it is fleeting and not at all like what I imagine it
might feel like) but instead the anguish at having his death come to a point
where I feel our relationship is on a cliffhanger. My father and I have had a
very strange relationship over the past few years, not even talking about my
childhood, which I'm sure a hypnotist could find some buried thoughts and
memories and emotions of things that I have tucked away in there, but just in
the past few years we have been in a weirld place that is hard to describe. I
still have moments where I have lingering hatred (perhaps hatred is too strong
a word) resentment, bitterness, and overall distaste for him. I have moments
where I think to who he is, how I was raised (by both him and my mother), and
how we interact, and I have displeasure in our relationship, and these moments
where in the past have been simply me being dissatissfied with the relationship
and nothing more, now are associated with moments of guilt as I have these
thoughts, these thoughts of a man who is fighting against a terrible disease, a
man who is fighting it as he fights everything else in his life, and needs my
support and my love.

And the truly conflicting thing is, these thoughts have even gone so far as to
give me a sense of "well fuck him anyway". This is the truely disconcerting
thing. I have had thoughts that, well maybe he doesn't get past it, and that's
where the story of my relationship with my father ends, and maybe I'm okay with
that. I have never gone so far as to entertain the idea that "well maybe he
does deserve it" as certainly, though I do have these qualms about my father, I
don't believe that any human no matter how vile ever "deserves" anything, and
even if the concept of one human deserving something were a reasonable one, my
father would certainly not be one who would deserve the treatment he has
received by this disease in the least. Indeed, let it be known, though I have
my troubles and my issues with my fathers actions towards me and our
relationship, and I have my issues with his ideaology, and how he lives his
life and the choices he has made through it, I know that truely deep down he is
not a bad man, and quite on the contrary I know that he has a very strong sense
of selfless giving towards his family, which includes me his son of course, and
I don't want to say that I know he loves us, because the word love doesn't mean
much of anything without context, but I know that his sense of giving towards
family is strong, perhaps the strongest thing that he feels. Of course I am
only speculating, but this is something inside of me that I know to be true,
and I can only know it to be true in having this relationship of father and
son.

However, I still have these reservations, these feelings of anomosity towards
him, lingering from my own actions and our relationship as it evolved over the
past six or so years through my time in college and afterward. Of course, I
know these thoughts are simply thoughts I cannot help in myself, and that all of
my thoughts are the consequences of my upbringing, my life, and of the universe
that provides and generates all things.

Still, the point in all of this is that there is still a discord in the
relationship between me and my father. In fact I have talked with my mother
more than with my father about this relationship, and this is only something
that can't be talked about, but will only come in time. But now that the
possibility of time is limited, now that it's unsure whether time will persist
past this transplant, this is where my feelings come from, and this is where it
comes back full cicle to the protagonist Aloysha, who feels he should be with
his Father Zossima in his last days and with nothing else. I feel my place now
is visiting my father, I need to see him, to be with him. Is it selfish? Do I
want this simply so that I don't have to live with the idea that if he does
die, I will be able to tell myself I did all I could to get things in a less
disconcordant way than I would otherwise? I don't think it is selfish. Seattle
Brett might have treated this moment selfishly (and I do still hold that
everything we do as human beings in done selfishly in a certian sense) but now
I know it in myself that my feelings of needing to be with my father come from
something else, something apart from me. Of course, it is not apart from me,
but it comes from my meditation of this world, the observance of my thoughts,
not from trying to control my thoughts. It is this observer, who observes this
feeling, this feeling of needing to be with my father. I know intellectually
the selfish reasons for wanting to visit him more, which is why the thoughts
could appear in the first place, but the thoughts and feelings appeared quite
on their own, without the guidance of the ego and it is simply the observance
of them that I am feeling now.

I made a visit this past sunday, four days ago, and I actually visited twice
with a session of Bikram Yoga sandwiched in between. I want to make time to
visit him, but there are so many other things I want to pursue in my life right
now that it makes finding time for it difficult. However, this feeling is
strong, and I am glad, as my heart has been eased on one point having visited
him. When I visited, the nurse there had to administer a Lovanox shot to him,
which he had to do for me after my incident at the hospital, and that got us to
talking about my experince. Something I've said a few times, is that in a way
it's much easier to be on that side than it is to be on this side, and I hold
to that, although for me I was only on that side for a few days, where as he is
on that side, and has been for over eight months now, but we got to talking
about that again, and my dad can agree to an extent. I then mentioned something
which I have said before I know to my mom, and maybe to my dad as well, I don't
remember, but I said it during my visit this past Sunday, that I wish I would
have told them at the time of my incident, but I knew I was going to be okay.
And the way I put it was, "I don't if it was foolishness, or false knowledge, or
where that knowledge came from, but I knew that my numbness was temporary,
that it didn't feel permanent, and that I knew I would get back the use of my
left arm, and that I wish I would have told my parents that, because it seemed
so obvious to me that it was temporary, and I didn't know that they were so
worried about that." And to that, my father replied, that he knows too that he
will get through this transfusion as well. And the way he put it, he put in a
way that I know was not false, he spoke candidly, in reply to my words of
course, but that, in spite of the percentages and prognosises that people give
of him, he knows that he will survive through this. It's true, it's genuine, or
at least, it's as true and genuine as I know it can be being on this side of
the disease and not that one, and the doubts I have been having that perhaps he
might not make it through this (for indeed I have had doubts that I haven't
talked about in this article, but they are there), doubts which I have known
and I wish to false, those doubts I can at least supress in good conscious.
Yes, I felt guilty supressing those doubts before the visit, for fear that I
was not supressing doubts, but instead supressing a realist attitude towards
this situation, but now I know that they are true, honest to god doubts that I
feel, and I can supress them honestly, knowing they are doubts and not thoughts
of acceptance. Acceptance is important, but now is not the time for that, and
these thoughts are not thoughts of acceptance. And so I will visit, and so I
will rejoice in my life, in my feelings of "being there" (oh there must be a
better word for that), and I will rejoice in the lives that we share together.
I will continue to visit, without expectation, because that is what I feel I
need to do, not to gain anything for myself or for my father, or for anyone
else, but because I simply feel that my place is with my father.

# 20180628

So this is the beginning of my second dedicated journal article. There are a
few things that I want to go over, and I'm not sure which to start with. The
first is a dream I had, that had me waking up a little disturbed, and the
second is I already forgot what it is. Oh, right, it has to do with a text I
got from my mom. Let's start with the dream.

Okay, so today I had a most peculiar dream. Fortunately, this one did not
involve marijuana in any way (the last dream I had was a couple nights ago, and
very much had to do with marijuana, but I that one, though it might be worth
writing down, was not near as interesting phycologically as this one). The
dream started (or at least the first thing I remember about the dream) in the
parking lot of a park. This park was similar to a park I remember visiting as a
kid where we had a sort of PE session once. The parking lot was on let's say
the south end of the park (this detail is not relevent, and I am only using
south to give indications of direction) and has a sort of open field from this
lot. I am referring to strictly the dream park by the way, and I don't think
this childhood PE experience has anything to do with the dream. Anyway, from
that parking lot, it opens into a sort of open field, but it's not really fully
open as there were paths and trees and stuff, so the field wasn't open enough
to play any sort of sport on, but there was a grassy part. Across this grassy
part, parallel to the parking lot, there was a path that goes across, and
across this path from the lot, was a sparsly wooded area. Not wooded, but there
were enough trees for that to be a detail that I noticed. In the dream I don't
go past this part, so that part of the dream is not really expanded upon, but
in the dream I knew it to contain picnic tables and things, where families
might bring food and picnic things and have a nice family night out. So in this
dream, the first thing I remember is being in a suburban, similar to the
suburban my mom had when we were growing up, and I am driving this suburban. I
remember my mom being involved in the dream somehow, I think she was in the
passenger side of the vehicle, and Kyle I know was in the back seat. So I'm in
the parking lot, and I remember saying something to the effect of "hey, lets go
over to the creek side of this park, I'd like to show it to you" or something
like that. You see, this from the parking lot of this park, one could drive to
the west (again, irrelevent direction) and towards the west side of the park
it became more dense, there were different things to do, and it was the same
park as the park where families might picnic, but in this area of the park were
sports fields and things of that nature along with a bit more winding road and
such. So I drive over to that part of the park, and at some point along the
ride, I remember making the decision that we were done there and that we wanted
to go home. Instead of using my phone to find the directions home, however, I
remember thinking something like I wanted to just find the way home and I
thought I knew it. So as I start to drive through this other section of the
park, driving as if on autopilot, driving through roads without thinking as if
I had taken this path many times before, Kyle starts reading to me about
Russian pronouncations. You see, I have been learning Russian lately, but I
have only just started, and at this point I have not gone beyond learning the
alphebet, which is why this came up in the dream. So Kyle start showing me
letters, and they just appear in the dream, and I start reciting them back to
him, the way they are pronounced. And what ends up happening is, Kyle gives me
a letter, I give him back the correct answer, but Kyle then tells me it is the
wrong answer. When I question him on it, he insists that it is the wrong
answer. In fact, I remember the letters, it was ю, and я, which are "yoo" and
"ya", and I know for a fact I said something in the dream like, "I know the
backwards R one is Ya" but Kyle kept insisting that it was "ee", and I said no,
"ee" is и, but I didn't put together until just now that they are both backward
versions of other english letters, and in the dream I was just insisting that
the backward R was not the sound "ee" but "ya". I remember getting very upset
in the dream at Kyle, and eventually I made it to a dead end in the road, a
sort of dead end that was the end of a parking lot where soccer moms might park
when their child has a game at the very end of the park, and beyond the soccer
fields I know there was a densly wooded area with a creek that marked the edge
of the park, and I knew that I was lost. So at this point I decide to stop
arguing with Kyle about the russian letters, and I begin to make my way back to
the original parking lot that I mentioned when the dream first started (or
rather back to when I first remember the dream), and when I make it back to
that parking lot, I am met by my dad. I don't remember driving up to him,
(indeed, I don't remember looking out of the car when I was driving at all, and
most of my dream took place inside the scope of the suburban) but I do
remember, when I was right next to him, I pulled up beside him in a parking
spot, and he was simply standing there, and I stopped so that he could open the
passenger side door and get in the car. At this point I think my mom had
magically gotten in the back seat, since she had gone out of my memory by that
point in the dream, and so the passenger seat was open, so my dad got in, and
he was upset, as if I was not doing as I was told, and that he was displeased
with my defience, and he might have said something, but at this point in the
dream I remember conceding to looking up my home address (1700 Tulane Dr., the
address of my parents house) on my phone, and starting up the GPS. At this
point, my dad commanded me to drive home, in the stern way that he does, and
after looking up the address I placed the phone GPS beside me like I do when I
drive with the GPS and began to make my way home. As I began to leave this
parking lot of the park, and go out on the road which ran North-South, which
was just east of the park, and marked the other end of the park, is when the
dream ended.

The reason I spell out this dream is not because I think anything remarkable
happened, but when I woke I was almost in a sweat. I knew I didn't have the
time near my, but looking outside I could tell that while it certainly was
morning, I knew I had not overslept, and I had my tablet next to me, which as I
mentioned in my previous article I have recently acquired, and I went to check
if it had finished it's windows updates, because I remembered that it had to do
that recently, and also to check the time on it, and it said something like
11:38. I had a very breif moment of panic, so breif in fact that the moment of
panic did not even happen as a realized that there was no way that it was past
11, and at the very worst I thought that it could only be 7:38, and the time
was off by a timezone. Upon opening the browser, I found that it was 6:38 in
the central time zone, and at that point I began to wake for real. It was nice,
feeling that awake at that time of day, and since today is a Thrusday and I
have no obligation to make my way to the gym to practice with Paco, I had
plenty of time to collect myself, have some water, drink some juice, rotate the
laundry, and perform some morning tasks that I usually perform in a bit more
hurry (or rather, not hurry, but with a sense of guilt as my morning tasks run
in to the time that I should be at work).

What struck me about this dream though, was two things. The first is my arguing
with Kyle about russian letters, which I now understand was probably my brain
sorting out which backward english letters coorespond to which russian sounds.
The fact that I got so upset at him for that though, actually does concern me,
and I don't feel guilty about it (for how can one ever feel guilty about the
happennings of a dream?) but it did disturb me for quite some time. I also have
been meaning to spend more time learning russian, but have let other things
take precedence, in particular, reading and writing in english, which I greatly
enjoy. So I think there was a bit of apprehension and insecurity about my lack
of learning Russian in the dream as well. There is probably some significance
to the fact that it was Kyle I was getting upset at, and this dream does remind
me of one road trip back in the days when I used to play Go, and I wanted to
try my hand at blind Go during this trip, and I remember getting upset at Kyle,
because he had some sort of handheld device that he was keeping track of and
playing the stones on, and when we got to move 30 or so, I tried to play a
stone and he informed me that a stone had already been played at that position,
and I remember arguing with him that there was not a stone on that position,
and that he must have made some mistake in interpreting the moves I had given
him, because earlier, I had remembered playing in a different way. At that
point, I remember my dad making a comment that the one who could see the stones
was probably right, and maybe he was, but I disliked that my opinion on the
matter was being shrugged off so matter-of-factly, and I remember at the very
lesat thinking that, while it could be true that my memory of the board state
could very easily be wrong, I also had strong memory of playing the stone in a
different position, and not only did I have memory, but I had reasoning as to
why I would have placed that stone in the place I did, and I also knew how the
way I phrased the way the stone was placed could be mis-interpreted by Kyle,
who did not enjoy Go at all in the way I did. So at that point, as I thought to
it, I am almost certain what happened is I told him to place the stone in a
certain way in relation to the other stones (because trying to keep track of
absolute positioning I knew would be too hard for me) and Kyle misinterpreted
my words and placed the stone in the wrong location, and that created a board
state on the handheld which was different than the state in my head. All of
this ended pretty much at that point, because I remember trying to continue on,
but after about 30 stones I knew the board state would be difficult to remember
anyway, as Go board states can get very complicated rather quickly, and this
entire thing was just an attempt to handicap myself to the point where I could
even get Kyle to play with me in the first place, and I knew that he had no
real interest anyway, and that the only reason he would even humor me in that
moment was because of the boredom of a long road trip, so at that point we
dismissed the game, and I remember suggesting perhaps we play for real, but
Kyle didn't want to, and that was that.

That whole experience, and me being upset at both Kyle and in a lesser way my
dad, was the first memory that came in to my mind after I woke from my dream
today. It was probably almost exactly ten or eleven years ago that this
happened, and I am certain that this memory led to the events of the dream
today. In fact, the concept of Kyle giving me "the state of things how it is"
(either a Go board state, or the association of Russian letters to their
pronounciation) and me trying to recall that state from memory is so strikingly
similar that I feel this has to be the reason for the inclusion of Kyle in my
dream today. And also the inclusion of my father as well. That's actually
really fascinating, now that I think about it, how very similar the memory fits
the dream, but with my current task of learning Russian rather than my task of
playing a game of Go.

So yeah, most of this session has been dominated by that dream, so much so that
I haven't even got to the second part I wanted to talk about which is the text
(or rather, group text sent to me, my brothers, lacey, and Granny and Papa)
sent by my mom. The reason I find this text so interesting is a couple things.
The first is that I didn't fully understand the text at first, and actually had
to look up a word to understand really what was going on, and the second is my
reaction to it. So enough mystery about it, this is the text in it's entirety.

    Text Message
    Tuesday 11:17 AM
    Ann Webster Family

    We just had the
    blessing of the cells
    with the Chaplin and
    they are hanging the
    stem cells.

That is the exact text as it appears in my phone as of this moment. One thing I
will say is that I did not see this text until I got back from Jiu-Jitsu class
that lunch, which would have been about an hour later, and by that point,
multiple people had responded with things like "praying for you" and stuff like
that. There was also a text sent from my mom sent at 11:28 (after both her
parents had responded) saying "\*chaplian" (escape sequence mine since
markdown), which followed with a text from Lacey, also giving her prayers.

So what struck me first about this was, I when I first saw this message, it
showed up as seven messages in my phone, since it was a group message and a
bunch had already responded. (Me nor any of my brothers responded) So when I
read the first message, I didn't know what a Chaplin was, and the correction to
chaplain didn't help either. When I first read the message, I just saw
"blessing" and thought she was asking for blessings, like someone may do,
similar to how someone may ask for prayers, but upon reading it further, I
realized that it read "the blessing of the cells", so I thought maybe she was
asking for us to pray for the cells to be blessed, which I also thought was
strange, but I know both my parent but particularly my mom can be very
superstitious when it comes to religion and things of that nature. My mom is
the sort that believes in the bible literally, and takes the six thousand year
interpretation of the world to be the actual truth. I don't resent her for it
(much), but I am fascintated by it because she is otherwise a rather
intelligent woman. However, upon getting to the point where I could entirely
read the message and comprehend what it said, I noticed that "the blessing of
the cells" was an event that happened with "the Chaplin" (chaplain as she
corrected herself later) and that it was an event that happened before the
transfusion. This is all I have to go on.

Now, at this point, I very much want to say that I do not intend to bring this
up pretty much to anyone. It was one text message, and if some ass hole wants
to give his blessing to a bag of Evan's blood before an extremely delicate and
scary (there must be a better word than scary to describe the chance of 20
percent death and 50 percent prognosis, as I don't want to portray fear, but
rather the sense of, this shit is serious and must be taken seriously)
infusion, and if that blessing make my mom, and maybe my dad too, I don't know,
but definitely my mom, feel better, than so be it. I don't care of the pope
himself comes with his stupid hat kisses the rod they use to hang, as long as
the pope isn't ill and it doesn't effect the procedure in any way. However, I
did not know what I chaplain was, and had to look it up to find out that a
chaplain is like a pastor, but the word chaplain is used when he is the
religous figure of an institution such as a hospital or prison or other such
place, so that the cells were blessed by the guy who I'm sure does this shit
all the time around there.

And that is what got me to thinking, how gross and disgusting that practice is.
I'm all for giving people a sense of hope or meaning, that kind of shit is what
things like Christianity is for, it's for people who don't have an explanation
for the things that happen in the world and inside ourselves, so they come to
the lowest hanging fruit because that fruit makes sense to them, and if eating
of that fruit helps them cope, or deal, or otherwise make better of their lives
in a positive way, than who am I to say that the fruit isn't there and that
it's the product of thousands of years of in-factual cultural evolution?
However, it's not the actual blessing of the cells which disgusts me, it's the
concept that somehow this chaplain has more right, or more capability, or more
divinity with the lord that he should do it rather than someone close to the
people involved. This is how this ass hole makes his living, is by telling
people that he is able to bless their cells, and that the lord will guide the
doctors hands, and he will use this farce to give hope to people in desperate
situations, and that's how he makes his living. It's fucking gross. Like
despicably gross.

And obviously, even bringing up the topic of this text message would be wrong
to do with my family, even my brothers. Perhaps Jason would be the only one I
would come close to saying anything to, but he and I aren't close enough that
something as trival as this text message that we both received would be a topic
of conversation that he and I would have together. So instead this is something
that will most likely never be discuss except long in the future when my dad
has recovered and I bring it up in a conversation over dinner or something, and
even then it the topic of religion is still such a touchy one, even with my
mom, that we are all wise enough to avoid the subject completely. So this is
what I'm left with.

I could go on a little bit, but I'm over my time and I have to get back to
work, so I will leave it at that. It just gives me a strange sense of discord,
not only my opinion of this text message and also my reaction to it and the
fact that I can't rectify it by bringing it up. It's amazing how utterly wrong
and disgusted it makes me feel over something that shouldn't be that big of a
deal. And it's not that big of a deal, I can very easily move on with my life,
but this is just one more thing about religion and my parents that will never
be aligned, and it makes me want to vomit. That is all.

Until next time.

# 20180629

Okay, so I had another dream today that I want to share briefly. I did not
intend for this to become a dream journal, but as long as I am having vivid and
memorable dreams that can be interpreted easily, I will continue to write about
them, and if nothing else it gives me a topic to get into the flow of writing
as I start each entry. At this moment, I haven't ever come to a point where I
feel like I have nothing to say, but I am only three articles in at this point
and who knows when I have been doing this for a few weeks I might become
exhausted of this exercise and feel as though it becomes wearisome, or
repetitive, or some other such feeling, and I don't want that, and writing
about dreams I think will help not only for me to have more memorable dreams
(because I really do love waking up and thinking about a dream) but also it
will help in sparking ideas to write about here.

So without further ado, this particular dream was a three parter. I don't
recall much about the first part, except that it invovlved Isiah from BJJ, who
I have not actually interacted much with as of late, but is a pretty cool guy,
and I end up eating Psilocibin Mushrooms with him in the dream. He shows me a
stash, and I take some of it and I eat them, and there is a particularly large
cap that he says I should only eat if I'm feeling very adventurous, and I end
up eating it.  I don't remember much of the dream beyond those details. The
mushrooms were in a room which was like Grant's room in Denton, but that
location has not come up before in my dreams, so it seems a bit minor of a
detail.

The second part of the dream involved me going to Colorado. I was with someone,
I forget who, but in this instance of going to Colorado, it was Peter and
Madison, and me and I'm pretty sure this someone was a girl, and instead of
driving there, we decided to take the ski lifts there. Obviously that's absurd,
but in the dream there was a network of ski lift like infrastructure for
trasportation, and Peter and Madison were in the seat in front of us, and me
and this girl (who I didn't interact with much, and I even forget if she was a
girl or not) were together in the seat behind them. The most striking thing
about this dream was a couple things. Most of the dream was about dialog
between Peter and I as he turned back and we discussed things, although the
actual dialog, and even what the dialog was regarding escapes me at this time.
The two notable things were this. One, I remember a moment, when we are going
over one of the poles that holds up the ski lift, where Peter and Madison after
they went over it turn back and inform us to be careful of that pole, and I
remember thinking that it can't be too bad, but when we go over it, we bounce
quite violently, and I had to hold myself in the dream to keep from falling out
of the lift. The second thing I remember is, shortly after this bump (the ride
was mostly smooth besides that one massive bump) we decide to stop at one of
the stops (because this ski lift like apparatus had stops along the way) and
visit another place before reaching our destination. This place is another
dream location that is extremely memorable for me, and I know I've written
about before, but this section of the dream ended before we explored it again.
It is difficult for me to recall the dream where this location was in the past,
but the location can best be described as a deserty area with lots of mountains
that have flat tops that come up and create canyon like valleys between them,
and the entire desert area is a pilgramage type thing with the start of the
pilgramage being a water place with lots of grassy mounds that create a lot of
paths, where lots of people go to recreate in, followed by this plilgramage
desert thing, and followed by an indoor hallway that goes to a snowy place. I
don't want to spend too much time describeing this whole thing because that is
another dream, and the only detail is that we decided to stop at the first area
just to check it out before getting back on the lift.  However, we merely
decided that, and this portion of the dream ended before we even really got off
the lift. I don't have memory of getting off the lift, only that we intended to
do so.

The final part of the dream is the most beautiful, and as I was waking up I
only wanted to go back to sleep to experience more of this dream. What made
this section of the dream beautiful was not anything that happened in the
dream, but the beauty of the locale. In this section of the dream, I was
returning to Seattle, the dream version of Seattle that I have had before, and
in this dream version of Seattle, as I was driving up, there is a point you hit
where you get there, and the whole thing is like one path that goes around this
great mound, and from the top of this section of the path, you can see the path
going off to the left, and a whole grassy area that is the mound that doesn't
have any path on it, but instead is just a great grass that goes down almost
like a ski slope with trees on each side and everything, and from the top here
you can see the beautiful water off in the distance, the water of Seattle that
is a bit like the lake that you see from Lakeview drive when I first got to
Seattle with all the boats and everything out there, but the dream version
where it's even more open, more diverse and so much more expansive and
wonderful. So this section of the dream was mostly me driving my way to this
hill top place, and me observing the humble sights, those sights which are also
breathtaking in the dream but that I can't recall in their details, as I
thought about my destination. I remember thinking about the destination as I
was driving there, and in this dream I was also on my way to meet Kim, the girl
I dated twice in college, as in a went on two seperate dates with her. The
reason Kim comes up I think is two reasons. The first and less artistic reason
is because I seem to recall seeing pictures of her on facebook at one point
visiting Seattle. I could be wrong on that point but I remember seeing it and
memory is the only important thing in dreams. The second is that, while I was
in seattle, and I was smoking all the weed and getting unreasonably high all
the time, I remember having a sketch notebook that was an absurd size,
something like 11x14, and I had this idea of using flower and star patterns to
create a scene I would call "Kim and Brett on the Rooftop" which would portray
in a sense the scene of her and I sitting on the roof of building at UTD, where
we sat after our second "date", and we just sat there for 10 minutes, and as we
sat there I thought about her, and about our dates, and I just decided that it
wasn't really flying. I thought about how I could have gone in to make a move,
to try and kiss her or something, but it felt wrong, like it was disingenuous,
and that I would simply be doing it to keep up with the social norms of what
that date and what that moment would have been like in a movie. This was a
beautiful moment for me, because though my kiss with Maddie months before had
been very bold "pink" in my memory of what that was like, this was instead the
most beautiful "gray" memory I can have. It was resolve, it was knowing that
Kim and I just weren't sparking, and I saw the beauty of that in that moment,
and it's more beautiful than grey. This happened I think my senior year, before
Scarlett, and Seattle was obviously after Scarlett, and I had wanted to capture
this moment in art somehow, but even in Seattle I wasn't able to find the
inspiration to make that piece, and I probably never will. Maybe I will at some
point, but I would have to go back to Seattle and smoke a lot of weed and go to
a particular park and find a spot on a bench that I have very clearly in my
mind, the same park where Sockeye tryouts were (and I only mention those
tryouts as an identifier and not because I want to associate this with those
tryouts in any way) and I would have to sit there with the very same sketchbook
with a pencil and make it appear, as if something else were guiding my hand.
That may happen in my life time, but maybe not, we will see. Anyway, that huge
tangent I went on merely to say, in this dream, I was driving to meet her
there, and I remember thinking about the junction of this top of the hill in
the dream world and the lake water view from there. And when I arrived there, I
remember stopping the car to park, because the rest would be a walk down to the
part of that section in the dream world that is at the bottom of the hill where
there is a VIP club that I am welcome to (and I am welcome there just because
it's my dream world and it would be weird if I weren't, I suppose I could be
rejected but that is not this club), and I was planning to walk down and meet
Kim at the entrance to that club so we could go down to the water and go on a
long walk together and reunite after a long time. I want to be clear that I
have no intention of reuniting with the real Kim, we truly were incompatible
chemistry wise when we dated, but this dream version of her represents a sort
of non-sexual uniting of two souls that miss eachother and want to see
eachother. She represents something inside of me, especially in this dream and
not in my active conscious mind. And so I remember in this dream, I made it to
this ridge, and I stopped and got out of my car, and stood there and was taken
away by the view. I was not taken away in the sense that I lost my senses or my
capabilities, but instead I simply looked out and took in it's beauty, a beauty
which I knew was there but always manages to take you everytime you take it
even though you know what you're about to see, and I acknowledged this feeling
of admiration, serene beauty, and I accepted it and turned toward the path to
see something I didn't expect. What I had expected was to go along this path on
my own, and to meet Kim at the bottom like I said, but instead when I turned to
the path, I saw her there, eager to meet me, a bit in the distance but not so
far that I was entirely sure that it was her and I could examine what she was
wearing, perhaps 100 meters in dream distance, and I saw she was wearing a
rather intricate swimsuit, the kind of swimsuit which would accentuate all of
her best feminine features, but at the same time modest, something she herself
might call cute, but I could only call the perfect swimsuit for her body at
that time as I saw, as if she gave thought to who I was and what I would like
to see her wear. And all of this I must remind you was all taken very
non-sexually, as if we were more acquainted than we actually are in real life
and we had shared intimate things before, as if our dating experienced turned
not into a relationship that would have a definite "break-up" point, but as if
our relationship would have turned from a couple dates of two people that don't
spark to a sort of comfort in sharing things with eachother that we would come
to eachother to discuss things and meet for food occasionally to talk about
mundane things like how our new job was going or how our life endeavors were
treating us, and through this relationship we hadn't met in a long time since
life had taken us different directions, but now life brought us back into the
same direction again and we were meeting again and we both had accepted and
were glad in the sort of relationship that we had had as two human beings, and
I saw her there, and with that feeling I saw her and was wholly surprised,
because I did not expect to see her at this juncture and expected to meet her
further down, but she had walked up to meet me and had been waiting for not too
long, because she was expecting me and knew when I would arrive, and when I saw
her I was taken by surprise and then a feeling of warmth that can only be
described in the context of this terrible run-on sentance which I should be
punished for writing. I saw her there, her beauty coming out through the
swimsuit she was wearing, and she smiled upon seeing me, and I smiled as well,
and we came towards eachother and we shared a hug. We embraced breifly, me
feeling her body and her swimsuit against my clothed self and noting the
juxtaposition of those two feelings, swimsuit and clothes, and the embrace was
breif but when it ended we stil held hands I told her that I wasn't expecting
to see her here, and that she didn't have to climb all the way up here, and she
replied that she knew that, but wanted to surprise me, to which I replied that
she looked beautiful, and that the backdrop of the water only made her more
beautiful, and then I took her hand and we both looked out to the water and
took in it's beauty together, both admiring it, but at the same time both
maintaining our facilities, our wits so to speak, not letting the beauty
control our emotions but instead letting the beauty become a part of our
emotions, and I looked out upon it, upon that scene, and everything felt right
with the world. And at that moment, we turned back to eachother, made eye
contact, and without even talking to eachother we both knew that I was to take
her hand and lead her down to the lake where there was water and we would walk
and talk and share eachother at that gorgeous scene.

It was at this point that I woke up. I will remark that I know last night I
slept naked, and I do not recall having any morning wood when I woke, and I
usually make some note of morning wood, especially now that I have abstained
from masturbation. I make this point only to say that there was no sexual
interest or motivation for this dream, and that the beauty of it was not the
sort of sensual and sexual beauty that we as mammals of the homo sapien race
only so much like to indulge in, but instead the beauty is the kind of beauty
that makes you feel utter awe, not even like you're lucky to be alive and
witness it, but just that it takes you away, not taking away your senses or
reasonableness, but instead the sort of beauty that fills you with awe and
becomes just another part of the whole beautiful stirring pot that is our
emotions.

When I woke, all I wanted to do was go back to sleep to experience more of the
dream again, but alas, that was not to be, as I had to make my way to training.

Speaking of, I have had so far a great day as far as training is concerned.
Paco taught a lot of standup things that I like a lot, and we had a very good
morning session. Also, today I had some very good rolls with people at no-gi
open mat, one with the little short hispanic dude who I am friends with on
facebook but I forget what his preferred name of reference is. David is my
guess, as that is his middle name on facebook, and his first name is something
like Fredricco or something, but yeah.

I think I have decided to forego registering for the Five grappling tourney.
This is something I have been struggling with lately, and I don't know if it is
connected, but I had a lot of anxiety for Dallas open, and I am getting a lot
of anxity for this tournament, and I can't help but think that I have created
an association with my loss in Denver to my subsequent drive home and visit in
jail only fifteen hours later, and that association is acting as a strong
catalyst for my tournament anxiety. Obviously I have gotten tournament anxiety
in the past, but this is on a new level. And I hate that I am feeling this
anxiety, but I think it is wise to respect it, and take a break from the
tournament scene. As much as it pains me, I really don't want to sign up for a
tournament and lose, as I already have excuses for my losing and I see that as
the expected outcome. Indeed, I am a new blue belt, and I know there are a lot
of killer blue belts out there, and I know this is something that everyone
struggles with, but there is something more. It's not that I expect to lose,
but it is more that I think I associate now the feeling of lose with my
experience in jail, which is a horrible thing to associate. The thing is, I
don't know if it would be wise to compete anyway to overcome that anxiety, or
instead to just wait it out until the weight of that felony charge is entirely
off my shoulders. As much as I don't want the latter to be the case, and as
silly and stupid as that sounds, either win or lose I don't expect to gain much
from competing. Rather, I think what I should do is go to more open mats, and
expose myself to more training partners, so that rather that discovering myself
and my Jiu-Jitsu through competition, discover it more organically and more
playfully through increased exposure. I am sure that I will compete again, and
I will certainly still be a blue belt when this felony charge gets resolved, so
I feel most confident in waiting this out. I'm am still mentally conflicted,
but in my heart this makes the most sense to me.

I almost forgot what I really wanted to journal about today. That thing was the
interaction with my mom yesterday. So yesterday, or the day before, I forget, I
wrote about how I have this feeling, similar to the feeling of Aloysha with
Father Zossima in Brothers Karamazov, where I have this need to stay with my
father in this time. So Thursday, I called my mom after work, but before yoga,
at around 5:30 in the afternoon, and when I called her and she answered I could
tell immediately that I woke her. Her voice was distant and vague, and I quite
honestly think I have never heard that voice before. It reminded me of the
voice of Ciara when she would wake. I like that voice, but upon hearing it I
knew I woke her. The conversation started like that. I called, and she answered
after about three or four rings, and she said "hello" in a very delierious
voice. I replied in a bit more of an enthusastic voice and I said hey, and let
there be a silence for a bit. After that silence, I then continued on with
the start of the conversation, which we had talked about having before, saying
that I was calling just to catch up on how things were going and to see if it
would be okay to visit. What followed was about six to eight or so minutes of
her describing to me my fathers condition, how he has been having diareahha and
fevers and is running a 104.5 temperature, and she mentioned a lot of things
about blood counts and transfusions and lots of other things that the doctors
have been doing to keep it under control. I stood there, in the stairwell of my
workplace just listening to her talk, mostly just taking it in and not
responding at all in any way, and instead just letting her talk and tell me
the things that she wanted to tell me. She also mentioned how she can't even
bring in water and other things into the room because his immune system is so
compromised and such that they can't risk anything to infect him, and she went
on like this like I said for over six minutes. Towards the end I started
contibuting with things such as "yeah" or "hmm" or "right" but I still just
stood there, pacing, and listening. And this sort of thing is what I knew he
would be going through, but hearing it from my mother made it more real in a
sense. I knew it would be rough, but I wasn't sure in what way it would be
rough, so it was interesting to here her talk to me about my fathers condition.
And listening to her, I got the very distinct impression that she very much
didn't want me to come, and I say this for this reason. So many times,
especially, and I have memories of this as a child, coming back from Houston
after visiting family, my mother and father would discuss events and
conversations of the previous week or weekend or whatever, and they would talk
about different people in the extended family, and their discussion would
always be in a sort of "negative but benefit of the doubt" tone. Saying things
like "and did you see what she was wearing" or "yeah, she stayed fixated on
that topic of conversation for so long" and other things about the things
people said, and the things people wore, and how someone acted in a certain way
in a certain setting. And not only that but they would always do so in a way so
as to speak poorly of the people which we had just had conversation with and
shared time with. And I paint this in perhaps too negative of a light, because
I know surely they also talked about good things too, like relatives of
relatives getting a new job or talking about how some new significant other was
good for someone, and things such as that, but in my memory, I remember this
sharply, because I would always reflect on their conversation and tone as I
eavsdropped their words from the back of the car, and I would contrast that to
the conversation and tone that they had during the events and during the
gatherings, and they were so remarkably different that it rose in me a feeling
of disgust. And the disgust was at the sheer two-facedness of it all, because
though I did enjoy our gatherings to an extent, I was generally speaking very
much against them as a child, not only becasue they were always sandwiched
between a long drive from home to Houston and back, but also because I took
very little interest in the conversations of adults, and would have only my
handheld video games to ammuse myself during the whole time, and while I
enjoyed playing video games, I selfishly saw no reason to bring ourselves so
often to this entirely different city to play video games there, when I could
have just as easily stayed at home and played the console games that I
generally enjoyed more. Indeed, as a child I was quite bent on playing video
games in most of my free time, but I digress. My point is, the distaste for
these gatherings that I had in myself, I was always as open as I could be about
them, and would keep to myself in the corner with my games and make my
appearances as I was obligated to, and I would be cordial enough simply because
that was the path of least resistance, all the while my parents would continue
with the festivities and the nicities and all of the other obligations of
socail interactions with extended family, and they would give an air of
enjoying themselves that I thought could only be false as I listened to them
speak back on the whole experience in the car ride back. Of course, in more
adult eyes looking back, I see that one can still enjoy oneself and still
gossip ruefully about the people you enjoyed, but I rarely enjoyed myself in
anyway and saw this same distaste in their ride back. I mention all of this to
say, I know both sides to my parents, both the outward side that they show to
their family, and the inner side that they share with only eachother, but which
I as their child was able to overhear in that situation, and knowing both those
sides, I could sense something in this in the conversation with my mom
yesterday. Indeed, she was being entirely genuine with me as she explained for
her time my father's condition, and when she was done I started talking for a
bit about how I'm not sure where it comes from but lately I have had this
feeling that I need to visit more, but even as I was saying something so short
as that my mom would inturrupt me in my words to attend to the nurses that were
there caring for my father and to attend to her motherly duties that I know she
feels so strongly for in herself, and even as I said my words, I could get the
sense that she very much did not want me to visit. So after I was inturrupted
briefly in the middle of my short thought, I finished the thought, but instead
of going on to the next thought that I would have shared had I not gotten this
sense from her, I instead put the ball in her court, and gave her entierly the
option to tell me to just stay the fuck away. But, of course, since my mom is
too nice, she did not take that opportunity, and instead we went back and forth
a little bit about how my father's condition again as if to deter me. I then
said something to the effect of how I don't mind those things and still feel
strongly like you both need my support, but I did then go on to say that I'm
not sure if visiting is the right way to support, again giving her the
opportunity to tell me to stay the fuck away, but of course again she didn't
take and said how she wasn't sure either. So at this point I left the stairwell
and said something like, "well, how about I go to yoga and I'll text you when
I'm done and we can go from there" and even at that point she kept saying how
she would text me, but even in that I could sense that she wasn't sure what she
was meant to do, at which point I said something like, "No, don't even think
about me, I'll text you and if you don't reply I'll just assume your sleeping
or something and I won't bother you any further" and we left it at that before
we shared our conversation ending formalities and I moved on.

The entire conversation lasted something like nine minutes if I recall
correctly from what my phone read. Looking back the call started at 5:30 and
lasted 8 minutes total. And I remember when I finished, and I looked at my
phone, I was in a position where my office was to my right, and the parking
garage was on my left, and I could see 114 the road that would lead to the
hospital on the right and to yoga to the left. And I looked at all these things
and I was able to put together the map of everything in my head along with the
timeline of how things would go in the future, and again like I said about my
perspective on the tournament earlier in this entry, I knew in my heart what
the correct thing to do was but my mind and reasoning and logic hadn't
proccessed everything yet, and so I felt conflicted mentally but not
emotionally, but the mental conflict indeed does create a sort of emotional
one, but this confict was instead a sort of destruction of my emotions as I
forced myself to try and see this entire thing from a logical and zoomed out
perspective.

In that moment, the primary thought in my head was actually the same as
Aloysha's in the Brothers Karamazov, after he joined the hands of Ivan and
Katerina, of that of a righteous fool. Indeed, where did my feeling of being
with my father come from? And why only just now did it make sense for me to
support them in this time. My father was in no state to be presentable. I
thought back to my experience in the hospital, and I felt shame at my present
state more than anything. I didn't want people to see me in that state, I
wanted to find my inner peace, and endure my feelings of pain and also the
feelings of narcotic numbing on my own, without the sympathy of others. I was
in a pitiful state, and I did not want to receive pity, as receiving pity only
made me feel more pitiful, and I didn't want to feel more pitiful but less
pitiful, so I wanted all the people who meant well and cared for me and wanted
to be there for me to go away so that I could enjoy (indeed, enjoy is the word,
but not in its traditional sense) my suffering in peace, and on my own, so that
I could find my inner self and use that inner self to get through my time
there. And I have talked about this with my father, and though he has said
otherwise (indeed, my father is much more extraverted than I, who consider
myself having a rather extreme, if not maybe a little disengenuous, case of
introversion), I thought about my own feelings and emotions. Indeed, if my
feeling of being with my father is genuine, why is it just now eight months
after he has been diagnosed, that I feel the need to see him? I know in myself
what changed, but those changes are only recent, and quite honestly they don't
hold up to scrutiny. What a saintly fool I am!

Indeed, it would make sense to visit my father just to be with him in his
current state in the heat of battle, as his body attempts aggressively to
accept the stem cells donated by my brother Evan, if I had been there for him
in his other states, but I have not and have only visited sporadically and in
times of better health, in the times between his treatments of Chemo where he
is feeling higher energy and less beaten down. If I had visited in his lower
times there, if my feelings of being there for him and for my mom had been much
stronger like they are now before in the past eight months and I had seen him
in his pitiful and beaten states and helped him through those times, and I knew
that my support in those other moments were appreciated, and that it helped,
and that I provided something for him, if I had been there in those moments
with that effect, then surely I would have insisted that I visit in this moment
as well. But I didn't, and so why now, at the time when he is beaten down the
worst, after I had so many opportunities to give my visits and my support a
test drive, why now at the worst time should I give my support a try? I of
course have my best intentions in mind, but my past actions make it so I can't
follow through on these feelings I have, it doesn't make sense, because I would
I know that I would be doing more good than harm?

And this is where I go back to the conversation with my mother. In that moment,
looking left and right at all the things I would do in that moment, I hadn't
gone through those thoughts yet, but my emotions knew them, and my thoughts
eventually independently came to the same line as my heart as I made my way to
my car and drove out of the parking garage and made my way west to yoga. I
struggled through my thoughts, doing my best to become an observer of my
emotions but not letting them guide my thoughts, and the thoughts I just
described above are the thoughts I came to in that drive. And when I arrived at
yoga I knew that it was not right for me, in that moment, being unable to
change the past eight months of my actions, to visit my father that evening.
Instead, I knew it was right to send my mother a message indicating my
intentions at that moment, and to instead find another time to visit my
parents.

I also thought back to my visit that weekend, where my father told me that he
knew he was going to get through this. My mother and father have gotten through
this so far with the support and everything else that has guided them through
this battle, and they can continue to do what has worked. This has been eight
months for them supporting eachother through this, and at this sort of climax
of it, they can continue to do so. If I were a wishing man I would be wishing
that I could go back in time and change myself, tell myself to visit more
through the poor times as much as the good times, but I didn't do that already,
and it's foolish to wish for such things. Instead, I can try and give my
support in the best way I can.

So after I finished the Bikram yoga class, I messaged my mom and said this.

    So, after our convesation I thought about and think it would be wise to not
    visit tonight and let you both get rest. Have some of my strength as you
    both go through this today, and I'll keep up to date with caring bridge and
    messages. Much love.

To which my mom replied with

    Thank you for making the decision! I am not great at making those right
    now. Love you too!

That message did not come until two minutes later, and at that point I had
already put the phone in the shoe and gone to the Yin class which I had decided
last minute that I wanted to join. And I had a great Bikram class and a great
Yin class.

On a much lighter note, the speed dating event that I signed up for was
canceled tommorrow, and will happen instead like a full fucking month from now.
At first I was really dissappointed about that, but instead I thought about it
and that gives me an opportunity to go to the Roughnecks game tomorrow, which
will be fun. It's a blessing in disguise I think. I will plan on messaging my
mom tomorrow to see how my dad is doing, and to see if visiting is something
that will make sense at that point. If it is, I think the plan will be to go to
the 3 o clock bikram class tomorrow, and then the Roughnecks game after, which
means I'll have time either around noon or just after noon (or before noon) to
visit. Before noon actually probably makes the most sense, but I don't know
what the state of "eating food" will be for my dad but if it's okay than before
noon would be a good time so that he can socialize and eat, if he is in a state
where socializing and eating is going to be a thing that is even on his mind.
This time I will be more keen on the signals I get from my mom and see what to
do from there.

# 20180630
So today was the day that I was planning on doing the speed dating event, but
that was canceled so instead I am going to plan on going to the Roughnecks game
in about an hour. I will arrive late, but fuck it, I don't want to watch the
first quarter anyway.

I still haven't decided if I want to do this journaling in the morning or the
afternoon. I want learning the Russian language to take priority, not only
because I do want to seriously learn it, but also because I feel that the
morning while the brain is still warming up is the best time to learn something
so taxing as learning a language, and my mind will be more receptive to the new
words and concepts and grammatical ideas in the morning compared to later in
the day, I know that. However, if I am to follow the trend of writing down my
dreams in this journal, I should definitely write sooner rather than later as I
am apt to forget my dreams by this time in the after noon. Indeed, it is late
now, 5:30, after the time when I would normally get off of work, and I had a
dream but I have forgotten most of it by this point, so that leaves me in a bit
of a predicament. I might elect to write about the dream first, if I have one,
and do this journalling just before I begin doing my Russian work for the day,
with some actual work thrown in the mix in the morning so I don't feel too
guilty about the whole thing, all before going to Jiu-Jitsu, at which point I
could return, do my work in the afternoon, along with whatever reading I want
to get done. That seems like the best course of action. Indeed, also, I feel as
though I tend to have the most ideas of what to write about in the morning, and
currently when I have those ideas, I will try to make note of them in my head
so that I remember them when I get to the journal, but later in the afternoon,
not only has the magic or spark of those ideas escaped, if not even the idea
entirely, but my motivation to write about these things has passed. I would
then leave my media consumption to the evening, be that a Russian TV show, or
novel reading, or my mastabatory youtube watching, just before bed as I am
eating my meal for the day. I think that is the best course of action when it
comes to the schedule for how these things will probably end up turning out.

So about this dream. Like I said, I don't remember much about my dream. I know
earlier in the day I had memory of it before the point that I have memory now,
but the earliest I can remember is, I was in a sort of rusty trapdoor, and I
was walking back in to it after looking around for my father. I was looking
around this area, and I don't remember what happenend at that point or what the
area was like, but I do remember having a sort of sense of "actually, let's
pretend like I was never looking here and escape back and pretend like I wasn't
doing this" which I think is probably a sense of my feeling to be with my
father followed by my recent events of calling myself a righteous fool put
together in a sort of dream way, and so after I was done exploring this area, I
was going to go back down into this rusty trap door which led to I don't know
where, at which point my father, along with some of his work colleagues which I
have never met but heard of before and have pictures in my head of what I
imagine their faces look like, finds me escaping down this trap door and says
something like "Hey, what are you doing here," in a very good natured and
surprised to see me sort of way. I remember at that point, I had that instant
where, when you are trying to fabricate an alibi, and the entire reason for
that alibi vanishes instantly before it can be used and you decide to entirely
abandon it and pretend like you weren't trying to fabricate an alibi, at that
moment I entirly abandoned my alibi and immediatly came up with a different
one, closer to the truth, saying that I was just coming here to look for him,
which was partially true but I made it sound like I had just started looking
and was coming up the trapdoor rather than going down it. My father took this,
and I came up to him, and the only other thing I am able to remember about this
dream was that, after I woke up, I got the very strong feeling that one does
when having a dream that it was my dream self understanding the situation
better than my real self, and that my father was good enough to visit today and
that I should go through with my plan to visit.

So taking this article through the rest of the day then, most of this day I
have been scraping through resources on the Russian language, looking through
various textbooks, youtube videos, tv shows, and articles, and whatever else,
trying to find the best resource for me to use to learn Russian. In between, I
began reading the B and N version of the Aeneid that I purchased some days ago,
and despite it being an somewhat archaic one, I find it to be quite readable
actual, more so than a lot of other translations of ancient works like this
one, and I quite like it because in the notes of the translation it talks about
the traslators great care in trying to maintain the tone of the original
without sacrificing the readability of it. The effect is something quite
noticably "old poemey" which I dislike a bit, but something which I believe I
will quite enjoy actually.

After doing that for some time, I called my mom and talked with here a bit. I
called her just before noon, after I was browsing reddit looking at my nsfw
subs for a bit and weirding myself out a touch, I gave myself ample time
in-between doing that and calling her so as to not feel so strange about it. In
fact, I think that is when I read the aeneid. Regardless, when I called her,
she was clearly distruaght to a point, but I feel she is staying strong, but
she was talking to be about my fathers condition, and she mentioned his dignity
(which was the word I was looking for earlier, I used pitiful earlier, but
dignity is a much better word here) and I mentiond that I entirely understad
that. Basically, I would have visited, except that she was planning on coming
back to the house to shower and gather herself and work through an issue with
her Fidelity credit card and other such housekeeping things, as well as to
visit Kyle and Evan and Granny and Papa while they were all together at the
house, and so I decided that while she does all of that, it made the most sense
to me to forgoe the visit today, and make the visit tomorrow. I don't imagine
that my fathers condition will be any different tomorrow, but my mom
understands as I do that the visit is certainly not going to be a sociable one,
as all sense of modesty and visitation has entirely vanished as of late. She
mentioned something about the doctors wanting to give my father steroids to
stop the "turf war" as she called it between my dad's still fighting cells and
Evan's transfused cells, and apparently that turf war is still going on to an
effect that is beyond what they had hoped for, and if it continues this way
they will hope to give him steroids which will kill a lot of the transfused
cells so they really don't want to do that but they might have to. I don't know
how that all works, as I am not a doctor after all, but regardless, my father
is in poor condition, but that was to be expected, and all of these things are
tactics that go in to the strategy of making a bone marrow transplant.

Also, as I mentioned, my grandparents are in town, and they texted me yesterday
asking me if we wanted to go to the german restaurant, the Bavarian Grill, for
dinner. I replied that I had plans for the evening but I could go late, and
that worked for everyone, so I ended up eating with them yesterday evening. I
had a pleasent conversation with my grandfather on my mothers side (indeed, as
you probably know my father's father was dead before I was born and his mother
died of old age about five years ago now) about his experience learing french
late in life like he did. I asked him at what age he decided to try and learn
French, and he told me that it was around his retirement, which was around age
55 for him. Mostly I was interested in how fluent and conversational he was
able to get with it, and he said that he was never able to get to the point
where he was truly thinking in french, and he was always thinking in english
and translating to french in his head. However, he also said that he only took
a nine month course at Rice university, and that he only visited france and
became immersed in it for a few weeks. He mentioned an incident where the train
they were on was coming to a stop before their desired stop, and the announcer
got on in french, and he was able to determine from the announcements that
there was an accident on the rail further ahead, and that they were trying to
clear up the accident and that there would be another train coming for them in
45 minutes or whatever, and he was able to determine that all through great
concentration at that moment, and that was what he felt like the peak of his
french had gotten too. Regardless, it was a pleasent conversation, and we
ended up talking about language and some of their travels and a bunch of other
things.

More amusing at this dinner event, though, was the interaction of my
grandfather with the waiter there. When we were seated and the waiter got us
our order, I could tell that he was not very comfortable with his position, and
gathered that he was probably new. I had ordered water, and I consitently had
to ask him to refill the glass, which is generally something that they do just
as they are passing by, and I wouldn't have minded so much if the glass weren't
so small (it was probably only a 16 oz glass) and if the glass didn't have so
much ice in it and if I hadn't just came from Bikram class and been needing the
water in a bad way. I mention only to illustrate the noviceness of our waiter,
which I don't mind (indeed, I could give my opinion on the uncomfortableness I
feel when being treated and waited on, but that's an entirely different
discussion). So after we finish the meal, and Papa goes to pay for the check,
the waiter returns after a bit of time, and shows him the card. He mentions
that something went wrong and shows my grandfather the black thingy doogy magig
foldy thing whatever that is called, opening it to him showing what I can only
assume is a receipt that says the card was declined. However, my grandfather
was not to keen on taking the hint to read what was being said, and the waiter,
bless his heart, was trying his best to be discreet about the whole thing, said
something like "well, it seems the system hasn't taken the card". My
grandfather then asked, "well is it your system or the card" at which point the
waiter says "well it may have been a bit of both" to which I could only laugh
because at this point I am thinking that the card must have been declined, and
my grandfather gives him another card and as the waiter is walking away, my
grandfather raises his voice to be heard across the table asking "well, was the
card declined or did it just not get run through the system?" at which point
the waiter, in all his attempts to be discrete at that point, eventully fell
into his ineveitable annoucement across the table that the card had been
declined. Kyle and Evan my brothers got great amusement out of this of course,
and after the waiter ran the other card and it was accepted, and my grandfather
had called Fidelity and asked about the transaction and found that there was no
transaction that had been run through there system (indeed, I have later
guessed that there might be something going on on Fidelities end since my mom
was mentioning that she was having troubles with her card as well), when the
waiter got back, and he and my grandfather began exchanging words, the
conversation went something like "well it seems the card wasn't even run,
becaues I called fidelity and they said they had no record of the transaction"
to which the waiter replied that it could have been their network and that this
sort of thing has happened before, to which my grandfather replied, "well hose
your network." Well, I don't know what the fuck "hose your network" means, but
the waiter interpretted this to mean "how old's your network" and replied that
he wouldn't know as he as only been working here two months. At this my
grandfather ended up conceding a bit, and the waiter walked away after
apologizing very sincerely for what was probably the sixth time in five
minutes, and asked us if we would like anything before leaving, making eye
contact with me directly and asking me if I would like more water. I could do
nothing but smile and say "no thank you", and if I would have been on top of my
game I would have been able to make some witty remark about the callousness of
my grandfather in that moment, but I couldn't think of anything clever, and
indeed have not come up with anything clever that I could have said to lighten
the situation even in reflection (although my reflection hasn't been too deep).
Indeed, this waiter should have just been refilling my water glass without
asking my permission to do so, so he was clearly quite new to the whole thing
and was only so unfortunate to come across my grandfather and his hallowed
fidelity card, and as he walked away, rid of us and entirely done with our
table as the check was payed, my grandfather began to laugh. And as my
grandfather laughed, I couldn't help but let out a good laugh as well. Indeed,
seeing him laugh with his great big belly bouncing up and down with each heave
of his voice, as his abdominals contracted and curled him up involunarily into
a hunched position as his laugh got bigger and bigger and less and less
controlled only made me want to laugh even more, and I decided not to supress
it in that moment, and I myself had a great good laugh, the kind of laugh that
you just let out in the moment as I could only feel sympathy for the poor
waiter and understanding of my grandfathers frustration. Indeed, that laugh
came out of me not out of pity for the waiter, but instead at the way my
grandfather handled the entire situation, with the least amount of empathy and
understanding as possible. To see my grandfather interact with that waiter was
something straight out of a comedy, a shakespearean comedy, where the actors go
back and forth with the most absurd clash of personalities, the one being an
old man with a lot of money who would never have his card declined due to a
lack of funds, and the other a young kid just trying to make the best of a
situation and acting in the most timid way. Innocent aggression matches violent
timidness. How funny that was. And I could have supressed that laugh, but I had
no reason to, and certainly a small part of me was laughing with my
grandfather, as I certainly have seen a lot of that assholery behavior in
myself before, but more I was laughing at the perfect storm that was that
scene, and the escalation it came to (indeed, it wasn't even really escalated,
because I know my grandfather and I know his kindheartedness, but that waiter
certainaly had not seen that side of him), and I laughed simply at the fact
that the escalation could have been entirely avoided had my grandfather had
just a touch of empathy for the man, but he didn't, and that was only all too
amusing to me. So I let myself laugh at that scene.

Besides that, as we were leaving I was able to discuss the topic of my arrest
with Kyle, and was able to get his side of the whole thing, which was good to
hear, as he rode with me in my car back to the house, where we finished our
conversation and I made my way back to my apartment.

Indeed, I have to stop now (I am quite done anyway) and make my way to the
Roughnecks game. That's it for today.

# 20180701
So today it is now in the morning, where as yesterday it was the evening time,
like I said I would do in my article yesterday. In fact, I literally just woke
up, and I am still gathering myself as far as waking up and gathering my
senses. You might be able to tell by the lack of grace in my sentence
structure. Yeah, it's very stilted, as if I don't know what I want to talk
about, and I am simply just writing words for the sake of writing words. So be
it, words are fun to write anyway, although it is quite interesting, I can tell
that my writing is much slower than it usually is. I'm not sure if this is
because I am just waking up, or if it is because I have nothing to say.

I do actually have something to say, and I thought about writing about this
last night after I came back from the Roughnecks game, but I didn't and instead
spent my time trying and failing to go to sleep as I wholly decided I wanted to
read anything and everything that I came across, jumping from literary work to
work, even reading various synopses on wikipedia to see if I want to read them,
before finally coming to a mindless hearthstone tournament to ease my mind. I
have this idea for my lit anaylzer, as well as ideas for my workout logger, and
both of those projects have been neglected by me as of late, so I might end up
writing out my ideas for each of those and getting to work on them, and making
one of them my project for the day/evening. Regardless, lets go back to the
events of my life.

Last night I know I had a dream, and I remember having a sort of moment when I
woke up in the night, but not entierly woke up but just that half awake half
not awake at all state that you arrive at sometimes, and in this state I
remember trying to keep in my head some detail about this dream, but even at
the time I remember thinking that it wasn't worth remembering and that the
dream was wholly short and entirely boring, so I don't remember what happened.
If I had a nice dream, similar to the Seattle dream I had a few days ago, then
perhaps this whole, "wake up and start writing immediately" thing would feel
more natural, but as of right now it feels like I am simply writing for the
sake of it without getting anywhere. Although I do say, now that it is a few
minutes past getting into it, and I am beginning to wake up a little better,
this is starting to flow a little better. Actually, I think I will decide to
take a shower, go outside for a bit, collect myself, and think about what I
might want to write about, and come back and continue writing. Yes, let's do
that. I will return.

-

So I am back now from my walk, which took me about 30 minutes in total to
complete, and I am back and I have a few things I want to talk about.

The first is, I think I am spreading myself a little thin as far as my hobbies
and interests are concerned, and I have been having a hard time finding the
time to do all the things I want to do, and I am not making strategic choices
as to what to sacrifice. That whole point my lie wholey in that statement right
there, but I had this sort of strong feeling about it as I was nearing the end
of my walk, as I was talking to myself about my felony, which was the primary
topic of conversation on my walk. The second has to do with my feeling of out
of place ness at the Roughnecks game, which also might have the whole of the
idea expressed in that statement right there.

So I am definintely being spread thin as far as all the things I want to do,
and I very much ran in to this last night as I was reading from so many
different books and things. I have so many great ideas of things I want to
write and program about, but it seems as though by the time I end up doing
them, I get lost in them, and begin working on them, it's time for bed, and
it's back to the whole grind of work, sleep, eat, train, yoga, repeat, which is
why my work life is beginning to suffer, as that is the path of least
resistance for me right now. At least, it will be the path of least resistance
until I get fired, at which point finding a job will be the path of least
resistance, I think, unfortunately. So with all of that, one can imagine why I
don't want to dedicate myself to a girlfriend, as that would just be one more
additional thing that would occupy my time, and I don't want that.

I would like to brainstorm about the various things I want to continue on with
for my projects, so before I do that I do want to touch on breifly the game
yesterday. The game was a wholly boring game. The wind was a bit strong, not so
strong that the concept of throwing upwind was entirely impossible, but enough
to the point where upwind and downwind scores were just as important a
consideration as breaks and holds, so the way the game ended up going was the
Roughnecks went up by five or six and then proceeded to trade downwind points
with Austin Sol through the third quarter when I left. I sat in my two typical
corners, which were on the downwind side of the field, but even there there
wasn't much to see. The one thing I will say is that I was very impressed by
Steven Borik's play, and he is doing great things for himself for the team. He
was a defensive handler for the team, and he did a very damn good job at it,
finding holes and punching in upwind bombs that you would expect from any calm,
collected, seasoned veteran. I made eye contact with Falkor as I was walking by
the stands, and he made eye contact with me, and that was it. Not even a smile
or anything, just eye contact. I made a smile and a raise of the eyebrows,
which was not returned, so I guess that is the level of our interaction now. I
will surely make comment of it if we ever to stop to talk to eachother on the
field, but unless that happens I'll just let it be for now. I liked him, but I
think he very much looks down on me and has become a bit of a douche now
because of his acheivments in ulitmate, and that's cool with me. I don't
particularly care. Besides that, I ran across Jack who was coming back from Two
Finger, which I didn't realize was this weekend, so we crossed paths as he was
coming in and I was leaving, and shared a pleasent exchange, so that was the
only real redeeming quality of the game yesterday. So enough of that.

So I want to talk about my productivity now. There are two primary projects
which, when I have them under control, will I feel go long ways to increseing
my productivity, and both of those projects are my workout logger, and my
literary analyzer, and on both of them I am just a little bit stuck as to what
I want to do with them. The lit analyzer I have tried to work on a few times,
but I have always gotten stuck at this one aspect of it, and that aspect is the
concept of how exactly do I want to expose the structure of a work? Everytime I
think I find the best way to do something, I think of a better way to do it,
but then when I think about doing it that way, I find reasons why my first way
was better, and I am sort of stuck in this loop of "well how the fuck do you
want to represent literature anyway you asshole?" One consistent piece that has
remained constant throughout, and a piece that I want to keep, is that of
organizing the entire thing into a tree like structure. However, I always run
in to opposing ideas of how to parse the whole of the work into said structure.
What I am doing at this point, is I am putting the authors imposed structure,
being the chapter, and book and section deliniations, all as implicitly part of
the tree (and indeed, this has to be done in order to break the source material
into smaller files, otherwise the entire thing would be too difficult to
manipulate in Vim without becoming annoyed at the unweildiness of the file, so
there are practical reasons for this), but I have noticed sections where
chapters will come to a sort of cliffhanger and the cliffhanger will be
resolved at a later point in the story, even across chapters (Clancy or Dan
Brown or other writers would have this problem for sure), so while the concept
of dividing up my files into chapters for ease of reading is one I want to
keep, when it comes to analyzing the whole of the work, it doesn't make as much
sense to me to keep the author's impossed structure.

So lets go back to a Clancy novel, and use that as a framework for how I want
to analyze this. Let's reduce a novel down into it's simplest forms. A Clancy
novel will generally have multiple threads running through the thing. So in the
prologue, Clancy will kick of his threads, usually three or four of them, and
in doing will then set the stage for the different, at first disconnected
stories that end up coming into eachother. I've had this sort of idea last
night, that each thread would be it's own independent thing, and that it will
contain a list of events that are a part of the thread, but already I run in to
the problem what the best way to represent all of this would be. Take the Lord
of the Rings for instance. I could have Frodo's thread be sepearte from Sam's
thread, even though for the most part they are always together, they do
seperate for part of the novel, and they have different concerns and such
throughout the novel. But this is the problem I run into (and this is perhaps
the questions that I have been asking myself in my head but not making
explicit), is when Sam and Frodo are having dialogue together, what parts of
the dialog go into Sam's thread and which parts of the dialog go in to Frodo's
thread? One method of resolving this would be to say "any time Frodo is
talking, it goes in to Frodo's thread, and any time Sam is talking it goes into
Sam's thread," but I don't like this idea for the reason that, if the whole of
the thread is something like "Sam and Frodo travel through Mordor towards Mount
Doom where they plan to destroy the ring" then the dialog between Sam and Frodo
would all go through that thread, but when Sam and Frodo seperate, it would
have be to be different threads. And that is the problem, is I don't know how
broad I want these threads to be. I have this concept of being able to split at
thread into to, so a thread might have all of the dialog between Sam and Frodo,
and then when Sam is seperated from Frodo, that would create a split in the
thread, and when they are reunited, the thread comes back together, and there
is that way of representing it, so in that way a thread would be something that
has a list of primary actors, and a thread is something approaching more of an
event than an overaching thread. Indeed, in this way, one thread might contain
the events of the fellowship from Loth Lorien to Emyn Muil, and then that
thread would end there, and the we'd have new threads for Merry and Pippen,
Aragorn Gimli and Legolas, and Frodo and Sam, and then the Merry and Pippen
thread would combine with the Aragorn and Gimli and Legolas thread when they
meet back up, which would be a new thread there, and so on, and one can imagine
how this would go. What I don't like about this is, suppose I wanted to
extract Frodo's journey to Mordor out of these threads, I would simply find all
of the threads that contain Frodo, and say that that is Frodo's thread, but
then that thread would contain all of the dialog of the fellowship between say
Aragorn and Boromir, and while Frodo is there for that dialog, he is not a part
of it in any way, so again I am at a loss as to the best way to do this, and I
go back and forth as to how this should be represented.

So at this point I think it is important to take a step back and reconsider my
purpose in these threads in the first place. The whole purpose of this idea of
threads is to bring myself to be able to rewrite the whole of the novel in a
different order, or just extract the excerpts that have certain symbolism, or
certain other ideas. So in this way, the concept of annotations is a much more
useful one. However, then I run in to a different problem, and that is the
difference between a reference an actor in an event. So suppose I want to
extract every excerpt regarding Sauron. There are so many references to Sauron
throughout the LOTR, but he takes part in very few events. Pippen sees him in
the Palantir, as does Aragorn, but besides that he is only referenced by the
characters more than anything. Sauron is not the best example though, lets take
Gandalf. What I am getting at, if I want to find the path of Gandalf through
the Lord of the Rings, should that include the references to him? For instance,
I know surely (okay, not surely, but I'm pretty sure) that Frodo at least
thinks about him as he and Sam and Gollum travel there way to Mount Doom, but
the event "Frodo ties the elven rope around Gollum and it burns him" should not
contain Gandalf in it even if Frodo does make a mention to him. Gandalf is
being refernced, but that event would not be included in the path that Gandalf
takes through the lord of the Rings. However, Gandalf should definitely be
included as an annotation in that scene, and this is where my problem lies.
Indeed, perhaps this concept of thread is one of those concepts that nears the
mark, but needs to be re-imagined in a different way, similar to how clever
mathmeticians just simply have to think about a problem very hard in order to
solve it.

--

So I think at this point I have three concepts which encapsulate everything I
want to capture in my system. The first, and most specific, is that of the
speaker, which would be the lowest most base form of an excerpt. The second is
the idea of an event, which would be composed of multiple of these speakers,
and would have multiple actors. So the event, "Gandalf tells the council about
the betrayal of Saruman" would be an event, but "Saruman's betrayal" would not
be, since we never have dialog which tells about the betrayal of Saruman in
real time, only Gandalf's recollection of it. I'm not sure if Saruman would be
considered an actor in that event or not, I haven't decided yet. The last is
the concept of character reference, and I think the best way to reconcile this
would be to have a list of tags that the system looks for for a character. This
could be done in the form of [brackets] like this one. So in Harry Potter,
everytime "He who must not be named" is mentioned, I could put [Voldemort] in
brackets next to the name. It would be implied that the brackets are added by
me. To find all of these references, the use of regular expressions would be
used to scrape the raw data, and one could imagine a function that takes in the
regular expression input and returns every reference in the source (as the base
level of source), or returns every event that Voldemort is mentioned in, and
also every event that Voldemort is an actor in.

So every event would have a list of actors (and these actors need not even have
dialog, it could just be known that they were there) but every source has one
speaker. I'm not sure how unweildy this would get, trying to mark out every
time the speaker changes in my work, but it could be done. The events are what
are imposed into a tree like structure, and I find it neccesary to require that
leaves of events could be applied in non-sequential order. That is, I could
have an event like, "the gang discuss their plans" and "the villian creeps
closer to the gangs hideout", and in the case that the author wants to create
suspense by writting about the villian creeping closer to the hideout
interwoven in the dialog about the gang discuss their plans, I could still by
forcing some sub events be a part of the first parent event, and some sub
events being a part of the second parent event.

When it comes to thinking about these things, I think I have to take a top-down
(breadth first) approach to these events. So a first level event would be
something that spans the entire novel (Frodo's journey through middle earth vs
Aragorn's ascension to kingship), and each of these events would have their sub
events. This is the part where I am still having the hardest time imagining
what this is like in my head, as both of those bigger events would contain
overlaping sub-events, which is a concept I have not been able to capture in my
annotations and notes so far, so I'm still struggling with finding the best way
to represent this.

So after taking a bit of a walk on this, while I still haven't totally
reconciled how this will go in full, I have gotten quite a bit closer. I like
the idea of using brackets (which, when I acheive a certain level of
cleverness, I will be able to generate using vim scripts and autocompletion to
allow for easy night time reading) to represent speakers. Every source will
have a speaker. An event will be a list of sources. (Also note that I have the
freedom to break up one source by the same speaker as I see fit. This will
become helpful when someone goes on at length about something, and at the very
end of their monologue, they ask a question which fits in an entirely different
event. So I could annotate with brackets something like [speaker:Aloysha] for
his monologue, and then break up his monologue with [speaker:Aloysha] again
when the tone of his conversation changes as I deem appropiate). Once I have
these events, I then think that the best course of action will be to have a way
to combine events to this tree structure. I also want to have the notion that
one source can go into multiple events, and also the notion that one event can
go into multiple parent events as well.

With this concept well formed in my head, I think it will be best if I continue
to read Mistborn and break down that story in this way. That story is
complicated enough to warrent this sort of analysis but not so complicated that
I will get confused as to what I am doing and why.

So today I don't have much to say. I did have a dream last night, but it was
mostly uninteresting, since when I tried to go to sleep in one location, I had
my watch with the alarm for BJJ on it, but I could not go to sleep in that
location because I just couldn't, so I went into my bedroom but didn't take the
watch with me, so the dream was mostly about dreaming that it was a different
time than it was, and I actually woke up at 3 o'clock after my dream self had
convinced myself that it was past 7 o'clock. I knew as soon as I woke up that
it couldn't be 7, and I checked the time and it was indeed 3, so I did some
quick sleep math and determined I had two more sleep cycles, so I went back to
sleep and proceded to have a dream where I created an absurdly massive joint,
scraping off a bunch of weed (and dust) from a shelf onto a big sheet of
butcher paper, and the entire dream was so absurd that I didn't even smoke the
joint but just made it into two pieces and that was that. It was very strange,
and I honestly don't even know how to roll a joint so the entire thing was
quite absurd. I woke up knowing how absurd it was, so I am glad that at least I
didn't wake up thinking I had smoked some weed like I have in the past.

I will say I will be glad when this First Drug Offender Program gets started,
because at this point I still have temptations (not to the point of acting on
them, but to the point of amusing myself with them idly and subconciously as my
thought will drift) since I don't know when the first time I am going to have
to piss in a cup is, and it could very well be more than a month from now, at
which point I could smoke weed right now if it weren't for my own self enforced
probation. Obviously I am not going to, but I imagine that as long as my
thoughts are able to entertain the idea that I could do it and probably get
away with it, I will probably continue to have dreams like this, which is
unfortanate, but it is just how it is.

I visited my father on Sunday. He is doing a lot better than he was on
Thursday. His fever has gone down, his diarehha has gone down, and while he is
still certainly not anywhere close to recoverd from this thing, it seems like
the worst of it is over. The climax has been acheived and at this point it is
falling action. We didn't talk about much. I told him about our experince at
the Bavarian Grill, which he got a good kick out of, and we talked about other
things in between when the nurse was coming in and out and applying blood
transfusions. The most notable thing is, as I was approaching getting ready to
leave (and this is something that I will have to remember in the future, a sort
of trick for handling emotionally driven moments, to have them towards the end
of a conversation when arrangments require that one party leave at that
moment), he brought up our relationship, mentioning that as a child he was
always told to do things on his own, and he felt that he wanted to give us the
opposite, to do things for us, because he never anyone do anything for him.
Now, of course, I had thought about these things before, but never had I
thought about his reasoning for doing all of the things before, that it was
because he never had things done for him, and that he felt strongly that he
needed to provide that for us, and he mentioned the time he changed my spark
plugs without me there, and he said that he knew that it frosted me, and that
he didn't know it would frost me so. And he apologized for it, and as I was
driving away I thought about how I handled that moment. I could have handled it
a little better, but at the same time I didn't want to just say "I forgive you"
because that is too much like he is the only one at fault and I am applying my
forgivness as some hypocritical saint, so I said something like "well I have
known these things and thought about them, and though I knew them in my head I
was too bitter to be okay with them (or something equally unweildy) but I don't
fault you for it. You did a good job. You are doing a good job." and I was
speaking softly, so he didn't catch the last bit, and asked me to repeat it, so
I did. And then we shared our goodbyes I held his hand, which didn't have as
much strength as it has had before but still had some, and as I walked out I
said something like "I would tell you to keep getting better but I don't think
I have to tell you that" to which he replied that no indeed, I didn't have to
tell him that, and I made my leave. I don't recall if I said I love you (and
the fact that I can't recall that indicates to me that I didn't because I would
recall that if I did) and I remember thinking that I could have applied my
forgivness, or rather applied my past forgiveness again, to that situation a
little better, but still that I felt that it was a nice moment between us. Nice
moment indeed.

I also mentioned that lately, as this thing has been approaching it's climax, I
have felt a stronger inclination to visit, and that I'm not sure where it comes
from, but at the end there of our conversation I said that it eases my heart to
see him, and indeed it does ease my heart to see him, and I am glad that I said
that in that way. I thought about this, how it could be a selfish thing, and
again I go on about being selfish here, but I meant it in an entirely unselfish
way, and only just afterwards realized that it might be selfish, and so I can
say that it could in no way be meant as selfish. It is one of those things that
should only be said once though, I think for this very reason, because that
statement is in a since selfish, as if I am only visiting him to ease my own
heart, so I will not say it again, or at least I do not see myself seeing a
situation where it would be appropiate to say it again. Maybe such a situation
exists, but I can't forsee it so I think it is something that will be said once
and not again, at least not in relation to visiting him during this time.

I want to jump directly now to the short story that I have not brought myself
to finish yet. It is rather a peculiar thing, that I feel as though that I
should only write it when I feel so inspired, and that I shouldn't touch it
otherwise. Indeed, what would be the harm in writing for it, only to entirely
discard it and write it again when I feel so inspired? Would there be great
harm in writing a sub par draft of the ending of the story? I don't think so,
especially since I have a very sub par draft of the beginning of the story, and
a subpar draft of the ending would be only appropiate. I guess this comes to
the point of making my writing speak in volume rather than require there to be
consistent quality every time I sit to strike keys on the keyboard. Indeed, if
the concept of writing out some thousand words of a story that I am working on
become a routine ordeal, and the concept of constanly weeding through and
editing and finding structure in that which was written is one that I want to
make part of my writing, then I think for sure I should entirely dismiss this
idea of having my first draft be good, and instead simply sit down and write
for the story without concern for whether on not I will be satisfied with what
I write.

Still though, this particular story I have such a fondness for, as I
feel as though it is not my own story but instead entirely inspired by
something apart from me. Indeed, I don't know if I still have the original
recording, but I don't remember anything about the inspiration or motivation
for that original recording, and I have no idea where the idea came from. I can
only imagine being so high in my room, thinking about my nihilistic thoughts,
and coming up with this story to directly express them.

What I love about this story is that it has only three characters, the Dragon,
the King, and the People, each entirely different, each with different
motivations and motives and all of that, with different reasons for doing what
they do. In fact, this is the first story with characters that I have felt
don't neccesarrily fit into a mold like my other characters do (since I am very
much not a character person). The king is very much a part of me, but the
dragon and the people both represent ideas that are very much not a part of me.
Indeed, I don't empathize with the people, and I don't empathize with the
dragon. Instead, they are concepts, reflections, of what I think those
characters should be like.

At the point I am in the story right now I have just written up the ritual, and
I was interrupted (I had to go to yoga) at the point where the dragon was
summoned, and the people began to tell the dragon of their plight. I do not
believe I have written it yet, but I want the people to tell the dragon about
their problems, and for the dragon to insist on leading the people in the kings
place. I want this to be almost forced, I want there to be a sense of fear in
the people which is invoked, and I want the dragon to insist that this is the
way it must be. I have a line in my head "For what reason would you come all
the way to this pilgramage, to summon that which you have fear of and request
guidance from, if you are not to listen and obey when that has spoken?" I want
to liken this to some myth right now, but maybe I have been reading to much
epic poetry and should leave the references out of it.

So I want to get this down before I forget it. This dream I had last night was
not too spectacular, but it is definitely worth writing down and setting off my
thoughts for this journal article with, as I feel there is definitely something
in it. Before I talk about the dream though, I want to say a little bit about
my night. So last night was what I would consider an ideal night. I went to bed
promptly after stuffing myself full of a turkey sandwich and a PBJ, along with
what must have been over a half a gallon of milk, before I laid down to rest
with my full stomach and my tablet. I woke up around four o'clock, which would
have been a good five cycles of sleep, all dreamless to my recollection. When I
woke, I got up and played the second part of the opus whatever it is of
Chopin's nocturnes in F minor and Eflat major, and I promptly decided that I
don't particularly care for this set and have elected to print out another to
occupy myself at the night like this. The second one is interesting, but I
don't have any emotion to it. I do find it neccesary to associate myself, or at
least become familiar with this sort of disconcordant harmony which I have
subconsciously stayed away from in the past simply due to the fact that it is
unfamiliar to me, but I quite like the sound of it when it is played well, and
I would like to familiarize myself with it so that I can better parse it and
understand it, so that my understanding of music as a whole will become more
enlightened as I continue on this path of neglecting my worldly
responsibilities in favor of indulgence in these fine arts. After I was
finished with that nocturne, I then went back towards the reading of the Grand
Inquisator of the Brother's Karamazov, and though I found it extremely lengthy
and unneccesarily archaic (at least the tranlsation by Garnett is so), it had a
cool little punch at the end, I liked the climax, even though I knew how it
was, but mostly I like where it fits in the story, rising tension happening
everywhere, and even so our characters are able to discuss this matter of
philosophy as if it is more important than all of the rising action that is
going on up to this point. Quite interesting indeed, if not a little pompous,
but the author makes note of this pompousness quite explictly, so it can be
excused as it is excused by the author himself.

But all of this has nothing to do with the dream I had that followed. Like most
of my dreams, I don't remember much of this one except that it had to do with
Crossfit. This Crossfit setting is different than the ones I've had in the
past. This one was a rather small gym, one story on the surface level (not the
one with the basement that I usually associate with Crossfit competition) with
one opening that faces west. And the fact that it faces west I know to be true,
or at least, I know that the direction the opening faces I strongly associate
with Left. This gym is much smaller than the big with with the pullup rig that
goes all around it in a square with two openings, this one is shaped rather in
two sort of rectangle areas, each connected, the northern one being more like a
square, and the southern one being more like a rectangle. And in the square
area, as will become relevent in the dream, there are two sets of pull up
rigs, one that is more reachable, and another that one would have to climb up
in some way to get to. However, the person on the upper pull up rig in the
dream is simply up there, and I did not think of how he got up there or how I
or anyone would get up there in order to use it, rather it was just a feature
of the gym that you could get up there and that it was completely normal. What
I remember about this gym is walking in, and talking with the owner. How I knew
he was the owner, I don't know, but he was and I knew it because it was a dream
and you just know these sorts of things in dreams. I don't remember the
conversation I had with the owner, but I do remember that it mostly involved me
asking him some questions, questions about his gym and such, and that the
nature of these questions was that I was asking him as if quizing him, not
because I had questions that I wanted answered for myself, but because I wanted
the answers from him so I could learn his answers. These are the sorts of
questions that I would ask (and have asked) Crossfit box owners about their box
in order to size them up. I then transitioned to talking about the workout we
would do for the day, to which he defered me to one of the others in the gym. I
must remind you that this gym was quite small, so while we were talking in the
southern part of the gym, there were two others who were working out in the
northern part, and the four of us brought the gym to its highest comfortable
capacity. Surely there could have been more in the gym to work out, but any
more than the four of us would have made the gym feel croweded. So I take a few
steps over to the other section of the gym, and I ask one of them what the
workout of the day is. The two people were already in the act of working out,
but not "doing a workout" or "WOD" as crossfiters would say, but instead doing
working sets and resting in between. So the person on the lower set of the
pullup rig, who was in between sets, begins to describe to me the workout that
they are doing, and the first thing he says is that it involves ninety pullups.
At this I inturupt him, saying that I am meant to do ninety pullup per round?
in a questioning way, because I knew this was supposed to be a very metcony
workout, and I knew that though I would be able to complete whatever workout
they threw my way, I also knew that ninety pullups per round would work much
more of a muscular endurance aspect of the movement rather than the breathing
heavy aspect, so I asked him something like "really, ninety pullups per round
or do you mean something else?" And then he replied something like, "well yeah,
we do things seriously here." which didn't answer my question at all, and I
immediately dismissed him as a foolish meathead who only concerned himself with
big numbers and used that to determine the quality of his workouts. The person
on the higher pull up rig, who was on top of it, who had overheard our
conversation (and how could he not, he was right there), then replies that no,
it's not ninety pullups per round, but instead nine pullups at the start of
each round, making a total of ninety. I then thanked him, and entirely
dismissed the first athelete, and focused my attention on this other one,
saying, "Okay, so describe to me the workout, it is 10 rounds of nine
pullups..." and I left the statement hanging there as if he were to finish it,
but then he did not. Now, I cannot remember if he went back to his workout, but
I think what happened is they both became a touch confused the first one more
so and the one on the rig I think more amused than anything, and this was near
the end of the dream, so I never got what the other movements of this workout
were meant to be, and I certainly didn't get to the point where I was ready to
start it. And that is where the dream ended.

I also find it pertinant to say that I did have some sleep paralysis at some
point in the night as well. I don't remember at what point in the timeline of
the night I had this paralysis, but it was accopanied by hallucinations again,
which now that I am aware that I do indeed hallucinate during my sleep
paralysis, I am made aware of the fact that the people I am imagining coming
into my room are not real, and I was able to rest easier and almost enjoy the
feeling of paralysis. Yes, enjoy is the word I would use. And in order to
justify my use of that word I should say a bit about yesterday.

Yesterday was a rough day for me. Currently I have been assigned a programming
case which I am not quite sure at all what to do with, and instead of working
on it I continued to work on learning Russian (which I think I have finally
narrowed in on a couple of primary resources I want to use, as well formulated
my conception of how I want to help myself learn vocabulary, so the hours I
spent yesterday, though they felt in vain a bit, were acutally quite fruitful
in my whole endeavor) and writing the story of the King and the Dragon, and
doing all sorts of other unproductive things, unproductive in relation to my
work at least, and I began to feel quite guilty of it all. That, coupled with
the empty stomach (I had not eaten enough the night before) and the feeling of
tiredness (which I blamed on the fact that the people of Alliant take great
concern in me taking a twenty minute nap during the afternoon, which I can
understand their jealousy of, but we would all be better off if we could take
such naps) led to a rather shitty late afternoon, which was only redeemed what
I was able to steal a nap during the spine strengthening series of Bikram Yoga
which I dread so much. I really hate the poses involved in the spine
strengthening series, I think they are silly and dumb and I don't like them,
which they would say indicates that they are the poses that I need the most,
but I disagree, saying instead that I would much rather work shoulder related
poses in that time as my shoulders need so much more opening than my spine
needs strengthening, and the soreness I feel in my back come entirely from that
god-awful series. I digress. The point is that I had a rough day yesterday, and
in reflection of that day I determined that it was mostly caused by lack of
sleep and lack of food, both of which are things that are in my control and
both of which are things that I neglected the night before, the food much more
so than the sleep as, though I know certain things that hinder sleep, I don't
have quite as much control over that aspect than I do the ability to jam food
in my mouth.

And that is why I say I could enjoy the sleep paralysis. Once I knew the
hallucinations, I was able to determine, by looking at my door, that indeed it
was shut, and the going in and out of my room that I thought I heard was indeed
hallucination. Indeed, if I describe the hallucinations as if I thought they
were real, I thought that what I saw was someone entering and exiting my
apartment, I heard the door opening and closing (and since I forget at what
point in the night these hallucinations happened, it is plausible, though I
think not likely that these door sounds could have been real), and I heard
speaking, as if there were someone talking to someone else as one worker would
talk to another about the work they are doing, and I thought I even saw the
figure of someone over my box which I am sleeping behind right now. However, I
was able to look over to the corner of my door, and I saw that the sound of the
door opening and closing was not accompanied by my door actually opening and
closing, so using this I was able to determine that the hallucinations were not
real and I was able to let myself rest there more soundly. In fact, I at that
point attempted to embrace the feeling of paralysis, because even though I know
the ways to bring myself out of the paralysis when it happens (focusing on the
breath is the biggest one, and ensuring that it goes in and out in deep full
breaths) I knew that the paralysis was a good thing. I knew that it wasn't time
to wake up and that I wanted to continue to sleep, so I embraced the paralysis,
and was glad in it. And that feeling of paralysis suddenly felt pleasurable. It
was the kind of pleasure one feels on the toungue when you place a tasty bit of
food on it, but instead of simply feeling it on the tongue I felt it throughout
my entire being (since the body is paralyzed, the concept of feeling a
sensation at a certain part of the body is gone entirely, so that all of your
sensation is the sensation of your being rather than the sensation of any
particular nerve). This sensation was not pleasure, in the traditional sense,
like one might think of orgasm though, instead this was the feeling one gets
when you lay in your bed and you know you should get up, but you don't, except
instead of having the ability to get up and feeling all of your limbs be heavy,
you don't feel heavy limbs but instead feel as though you are just a spirit in
space. This feeling can be very scary, especially if you try and resist it and
attempt to move your limbs (which I remind you are paralyzed), but once I was
able to accept it and realized that it was the feeling that I wanted to
embrace, I was able to embrace it, and then I returned to sleep.

--

I feel very compelled now to write about the dream I had. This dream was very
vivid and involved the consumption of Marijuana and the subsequent drug testing
that would happen, along with alot of other symbolism involving my mom, the
setting and other things, that I do truly have to write about it. This dream
happened after a nap occuring on July the third, after we were dismissed early
from work, and I decided to lay my head down despite the fact that I knew I had
signed up for Bikram yoga that day at 5. This dream actually occured
immediately after I had woken up at five o'clock almost precisely, and saw that
I would indeed be missing my Bikram yoga class for the day.

This dream began in a house that was almost exactly like the Franda's, a dream
location that I know I have had before, and which truely was the spitting image
of the Franda's old house from my childhood. In this location, on the stove,
there was a bit of Marijuana, and for some reason, which I had reciprocated
with my mom, who agreed, I had determined that it was required for me to take a
hit of marijuana, and subsequently get drug tested immediately following, in
order to mark the beginning of the process which I have literally just today
signed on to. So in the dream I had rolled up a joint (in these dreams it is
always a joint even though as I've said before I don't know how to roll a joint
in real life and the joint is very much not my prefered methode of consumption)
at the stove of the Franda's, and I took a sort of ritualistic hit, savoring it
as a convict on death row might savor his last meal (that analogy is mine in
this moment, I wasn't thinking about death row in the dream, but I simply
wanted to emphasize that I savored it as a man condemned might savor something)
before proceeding to talk to my mom about what needs to be done. I discussed
with her the plan, and after I had taken the hit, I came to her, or she to me,
in that place of the Franda's, and talked about what needed to be done. I gave
her the paperwork, and we went together to the place where I was to get tested.
Now, this place, which was just down the road from the Franda's place where the
dream started, we were able to walk to, and I know I have been to this place
before in my dreams, although I forget in what context this dream location
exists, but it's description I will describe now. In the bottom floor, you walk
in from the corner, and the first thing you see straight ahead is door to an
inner stairwell which leads to the upstairs area, which when you are in the
upstairs area is not really upstairs, but to the left and right of this stair
well entrance, coming at ninety degrees from the corner through which you walk,
is a big open area, one could imagine being in an airport or stadium or
something else that has this area, and to the left there is a laser tag
section, which I have had dreams about before, and to the right, I'm not sure.
This area reminds me very greatly of some other dream locations which are
appearing to me as a write this almost against my will, as I try and imagine
which dream area this one truely was, I have all these other dream locations
appearing in my mind, so this location must have some sort of significance to
me. Regardless, we, me and my mom, looked around this area, left and then
right, before deciding that up was the direction we needed to go. And I want to
mention at this point as well that this place was a place intended for
children, that this establishment was created for the amusement of children,
similar to Chuck E Cheese or similar, but for slightly older children, and as
we went up this stairwell, which the stairwell itself had this sort of
steampunk back alley feel to it, as if the walls and floors hadn't been cleaned
in years, we made it to the up stairs area. Now this upstairs area, as you walk
up into it, had this peculiar feature. There was a sort of walkway, where as
you come up the stairs (there was no exit door to the stairs, even though there
should have been) on your left is a wall that comes up to about chest height,
which when you get high enough on the stairs you can easily see over into the
room to the left, and this wall goes on from the top of the stairs a good way,
maybe three or four yards, until you get to the top right-most of the room,
which has a doorway into the "employees only" area of the room. Upon coming to
this sort of walkway, I look to the left to see many children in roller skates
going around on this roller rink, as this upstairs area is a roller rink, and
the wall that you can look over marks the edge of the rink. Evenutually the
wall comes down, to the floor where the rink meets the walkway, indicating the
perimeter of the rink, and the entire place was dark except for one opening
that was past the walkway beyond the chest high wallway where it is open and
leads to somewhere with light. I want to talk about this place with light for a
moment, because it does not simply lead outside, but it leads to another
portion of the dream area which surely must represent something else to me,
but I don't know what in this moment, and I don't know if I have ever been
there before, but I see in my head right now a sort of air hanger area, a
garage sort of space, where you could imagine that airplanes are kept, antique
single passengers airplanes, but this area does not come up again in the dream.
I don't know why this area feels significant to me, but it does. Regardless,
when we reach the top of the staircase, we are greeted by a man, clearly a
young kid no older than me or at the very most my age who works there, and
seeing this peculiar thing of a grown man walking up these stairs with his mom
to this place clearly intended for children, he inquires if he can help us. I
take a breif glance to my mom, who gives me the gesture to take care of this as
an adult would, and I speak to him and request in that moment, to be
administered a drug test. Actually I asked first if they administer drug tests,
but I didn't wait for the answer and simply then requested to be admistered
one. He asks me for my paperwork, which I remember pulling out of my pocket,
and looking to my mom as if to ask in one moment of eye-contact "this is
correct right?" to which she nods. After procuring the paper-work, he then asks
me, "and this drug test is meant to return clean is it not?" to which I at
first say yes, of course, but then remember that I had taken a hit of the
joint, and at that moment the reason for taking that hit escapes me, and for
the first time in the dream I start to realize that maybe the reason I took the
hit was illegitament, and that I just come up with it as an excuse to take a
hit, but I then thought that that, also, was an absurd thought, and that I had
distinctly remembered being against taking the hit at first but indeed did have
very legitamte reason for doing so, but that reason was escaping me. I tried to
explain this to the worker there, who looked at me with a sort of guilty
glance, as if he knew that I was full of shit, and I remember asking to call my
attorney after the test had been done, or I actually asked my mom to call the
attorney, because she didn't know the reason for my taking the hit. Eventually,
after the judgemental (that's the word!) glance from the attendent there lasted
a bit, I remember asking to be adminstered the test anyway, and to let it come
back positive and that I knew that that was the plan, although I was second
guessing myself the entire time. The attendendent, still with his judgemental
look on his face, takes me through the employees only area at the back right of
the room from the stairs, and in this area is a kitchen area, much closed off
from the rink area and much more enclosed and almost even claustrophobic, and
in this kitchen area is an employees only bathroom which I am led into. This
bathroom was a single person restroom, and was quite unkept, being very dirty
and rusty as a neglected outdoors camping restroom might be, and in this place
I took all of things I had in my hand and put them on the sink which was there
next to the toilet, and I found the cup I was meant to pee into. In all of
those things I also saw my phone, which I thought about the illigatamcy of the
whole thing (as if I could somehow produce clean piss from my phone) and
thought about using it to get the reason for taking the hit from my attorney,
but I knew my mom was calling him so I didn't. So at this point we are nearing
the end of the dream, as I took the cup, and also this device which looked like
a pregnancy test, and I started peeing into the cup, and interjected this other
testing device between the stream and the cup, and immediately the device
showed a blue line indicating that the urine was not clean (which I had for
some reason thought it wouldn't even though I had just smoked weed earlier in
the dream), and I began to go into a sort of calm panic, if that makes sense,
knowing that panicing wasn't worthwhile in that situation, but not having any
other sensible thing to do. After doing this, for some reason to complete the
task I had to apply a sort of sticker to the underside of my penis, which had
become incredibly erect all of a sudden, as if it had been erect the whole time
and I hadn't realized it, and I heard my mom outside talking with the
administer of the test, speaking about just how clean I had been the past days,
knowing it to be true, and also talking about how I had given up masterbation
as well, and how she was so impressed by it, and that he must have had a good
reason to smoke the marijuana because he has been otherwise extremely faithful
to staying clean. So as I am applying this sticker thing to my extremely erect
(and to go into detail, very veiny and almost even the texture of glass, as I
thought about how it resemebles the pipe that I like to smoke out of, and as I
thought this the veins started to resemeble strongly the artistic markings on
my pipe, and though I have made the pipe/penis analog in my head before, who
hasn't, I had not made the analogy of the veins to the decorative marking
before), as I am applying this sticker, and listening to my mom talk so highly
of me, I felt as though somehow everything would be okay. I thought about how I
did not have even the slightest compulsion to stroke that large penis to orgasm
so as to lower it, but instead I just let it be entirely erect and did nothing
to try and prevent it. So I applied this sticker to the underside of my erect
penis, and closed up the cup and put all of the things aside, and that was the
end of the dream. The dream ended before I knew anything about what would
happen as a result of that test.

I will remark that I did have a bit of wood as I woke up, (although not nearly
as much as the dream would have indicated, just a slight chubby that went down
rather quickly after waking) and that this was one of those times where I had
to gather myself and remind myself that I had not in actuality smoked anything,
and I want to say that I felt rather dehydrated and "numb" in a way that I
sometimes do when I take naps of this single REM length. Indeed, when I woke I
found the length of the sleep to be exactly one sleep cycle, as I woke at 6:35,
which would mark out exactly one full cycle of REM sleep. I then lay there,
deciding to wake up, and I have been writing ever since, which has taken just
under an hour to do.

I could have dismissed this dream a simply another marijuana dream, but there
seems to be something more here, the images of unclean area, the judgmental
(and now that I think about it probably hypocritical) look on the attendents
face, and the fact that my mom is there, and that she knows about my giving up
masterbation (I have told her about this before and we have had discussions
about it), and the peculiar erection that I had towards the end, all point to
something, but I can't put all the peices of it together, but I can only leave
it as it is so that one day maybe I'll read it back and still not know what it
all means but instead will simply just live with it being there. The dependance
on my mother is what troubles me the most, similar to a past dream I have
written about, where it is simply there, and as much as I don't want to label
it or assign it anything, I can only think that I dislike that aspect of my
subconscious, and it gives me curiosity as to when that aspect might go away. I
don't know.

--

At this moment, now, I have a compulsion to write. Indeed, there is this story
that I have thought of, that I haven't had the time to discover yet, but I
think it is time to discover it.

Inside of me, there are four characters. Each of these characters falls on a
different end of a two by two square, the sorts of two by two squares that are
a part of any good ted talk, the kind of two by two square that always aims to
oversimplify something so as to make it understandable to the most stupid of
audiences, stupid in the sense that even though the individuals in that
audience may each be intellgent, the intersection of the intellegence of the
whole of the group could be said to have the IQ of only the most dull of farm
animals. The sort of stupidity that smart people will see be able to apply to
their own intelligence in an intellegent way, but when taken on its own and
analyzed as it's own work is taken as nothing but a gross oversimplifaction of
a vast and varied topic that scholars of many ages have wrestled with through
debate across grand scenes with wide implications on the thought and cultures
of our people.

My square is thus: on one dimension, we have the belief in Christianity, in
God, the God of the bible, and on the other dimension, we have dogmatism in
belief. So you can see the four extremes of these two spectrums. On the one
extreme end, we have the dogmatic Christian, believing in Christianity wholely
and completely, taking part in rituals of faith. On the other extreme end, we
have the dogmatic Atheist, in all his grossness of oversimplifications. Next,
we have the concept of the accepting Christian, similar to say Grant or Tim in
my own life, and then we have the character most representing myself, the
skeptical agnostic, seeing the reasonablness of everything and taking as few
axioms from the world as he can.

In my work, I will make no attempt to glorify the character representing
myself. In fact, I would very much like the reasonable Christian to be the
focus of the work, and have him be the protagonist in the story.

How these four become friends, I do not know yet. What brings them together?
What is the thing that makes these four inteact? It must be something wholly
unrelated to Christianity, some worldly pursuit that they all share. Maybe they
all play on the same sports team? I think for this story to work, it must be
written like a novel, similar to something like Anna Karenina, where the
characters each have their own affairs and their own dealings, and I need to be
able to explore each of them as individuals, and in pairs, and all together, in
order to get the whole of my work written in adequete fashion.

What is the setting of my story? I have failed to mention a fifth character,
the fifth cardinal direction, of a man, a hermit, taken as a spiritual figure,
who dies at the time of the characters, and found are his notes, his tomes, at
first scattered, but later compiled and put together. These writings will be of
my mythology. And at this point it is important to lay out the mythology of the
story. I want this man to tell his mythology in dreams, and in visions. I want
the mythology to be revealed through the lens of this hermit. I also want to
very much explore the mind of the hermit. I want there to be articles written
by him which are simply idle musings by him, where he questions his own visions
and questions his motivations for hermitage. I need to seclude myself for some
time in order to truly acheive this effect. When will that happen? I don't
know. If I am to marry and have children, I don't know when that might occur.
But I hope for my sake that it does.

I don't know what will be my mythology. So far I have several disconnected
stories, and I hope that through my dreams and my sparks of ideas that I have
and write into this journal that I can come up with an adequeate mythology. So
far I have the story of the King and the Dragon, but that is more of a tale
than a mythology. The dragon and the King would fit more in the history of my
world, similar to how Tolkien's middle earth is really an alternate history of
our earth, rather than a part of the mythology. But still, I need a mythology
as well.

How this mythology interacts with our real world, I am still not sure yet. I
want it to be through prophets and such, but I want the prophets to be
unreliable. I don't want there to ever be a sense of these people knowing for
certian the mythology. However, I want their stories to verify eachother
independently. This is difficult to do without making their stories self
fullfilling. In fact, that could be a crucial aspect of the whole thing as
well, including prophets who are found to be false. I also want to include real
prophets from our time, your David's and your Isaiah's and Mohammeds and such.
I want these prophets to be used more as reference though, I want the prophets
in my story to reference these and perhaps be aware of them, but I don't want
them to actually be a part of the mythology.

All of this is so mixed up in my head as to what I want. So far the only
original creation that I have is the character of Fice, who is a sort of
Devil's accomplice, as well as the original idea of the headless angels, those
that lose their way and impale themselves in order to gain their flight again.
Both of these concepts are very much concepts conceived of by my college self,
and I think that I have to let go of them because I didn't write about them
when I was in college, and those concepts and ideas are not so dear to me now
as others are.

I have a very strong inclination to talk about injustice, especially due to the
recent events of my life, the events being my dad's diagnosis of Lukemia as
well as my being charged with a felony. The adjudicator is a member of this
mythology.

# 20180704
So I woke up today thinking only about how much I didn't want to go to yoga. I
would so much rather sit here and describe my dream. So that's what I'm doing.

So this dream starts at the parking lot of this sort of crowded ocean location.
Or at least, I'm pretty sure it's the ocean, although thinking on it, the water
is much too still to be the ocean and it is probably a really big lake. If I
had to give a location for this whole thing, it would probably be the sister
city of my dream location of Seattle, so I suppose this is dream Portland. It
only makes logical sense. Anyway, I would like to spend a few words describing
the location. So as I said, this location is a massive lake, so massive that I
didn't even think to look out to the other side and see if it were possible to
swim across, and having woken up now, as I said, my first inclination was that
this was the ocean, but thinking about it, and thinking about exploring the
location in my mind, I know in my mind that if I were to get in a boat and
travel across it, I would certainly reach the other side, and I could go around
in a circle and go along the perimeter of this lake, so it is indeed a lake,
just a rather large one. That, and I know for certain that it is fresh water
rather than saltwater, and that the water is relatively still. So at the sort
of "popular entry point" to this lake is a parking lot, a rather small one for
the number of people that were here, but such things don't have to make sense
in this context. Somehow these people are all here, all of which are visiting,
and all of which somehow made it there without needing a spot to park. The
wonders of dream logic. From this parking lot, there is a sort of floating
bridge. If you can imagine the floating docks that you see at certain places,
that rise and fall with the tides, this place had many of these sort of
floating docks like this, but they were all connected in a wide web of piers
and bridges, all of which connected off of this one parking lot location. I
also do know, similarly to how I know that this body of water is a lake, that
there are other connecting locations for this dock network, and when I say
other connecting locations, I mean just one other, now that I think about it.
So this whole dock network, which is actually more solid than these floating
docks now that I think about it, has many different nodes and areas, some
covered, some not, all of which are different and unique in their own way, and
all of which are connected by these bridges in their own way. One can imagine a
children's playground, the sort of playground with a few circular areas, barred
off, with little children bridges between them, but all adult sized, and most
of them meant for adults to come to and lounge at and fish from. Because that
was what a lot of people were doing in the dream, not only the people who I
know in the dream, but just a lot of people, were fishing from these location
where it was appropaite. So the scene having been described, that is honestly
most of what the dream is. The dream starts with me parking my car in this
parking lot. I do want to mention that this is very much another dream I have
had of me living in my car. I was living in my car in this dream. And I don't
know when this first event happened, if it happened while I was in the car,
before the dream started, or if I farted a little too vulptuously in the dream
itself, but for a vast majority of the dream, perhaps even the entire dream, I
had come to this place for leisure, but the entire time I was looking for a
restroom, because in the dream, either before or during like I said I don't
remember, I had farted, but instead of a fart it had a little bit of poo in it,
and the entire dream I was attempting to find a restroom to take care of the
mess I made. Now, I am very much reminded of the time in Seattle that this did
indeed happen to me, but in Seattle when it happened, I immediatly (like a
thinking and reasoning human being would) checked myself, realized I had shit
in my pants (not a lot mind you, but enough that the term "I had shit in my
pants" is a reasonable thing to say), and took off the underwear I was wearing,
wiped myself breifly with the clean part of it so as not to spoil anything else
in the car, put on new underwear, and promptly threw the soiled underwear in
the nearest dumpster. I was a bit embarrassed by the event, but I knew that it
would all be okay, and that I was the only one who knew anything about the
whole thing, so I didn't concern myself with it. However, this dream was not
like this, for some reason I had determined that I needed to find some sort of
restroom in order to right this situation, and the entire dream was spent going
from person to person, being as cordial to them as I could while still finding
my way to a place where I could take care of my situation. So as I step onto
this pier web structure (because the whole point was to enjoy the scenes and
the view, which unfortanatly as you will find, I woke up before I could do
that) I step on and go along the first part of the bridge. At first it is
uncovered, but after a few dozen steps you go to a covered area, and this
covered area also has a wall at the back, towards the left side when you enter
it, and it comes to a sort of semi-circle area, which is wider than the bridge,
and could be said to be the first stopping point on this network of bridges. As
I get to the covered point, I had a sort of out of body dream experience, where
I took the point of view of a diver watching the fish take the bait, and I
overheard too people talking in this dream about thier fishing experience,
which is what prompted the out of body moment. I heard them talking about how
one of them caught a shark, and as he described it I could see the shark
grabbing thier bait and hooking on their line, but the shark had been eaten by
a whale, and as I heard him say that I could see the whale devour the shark in
a whole bite, the shark being one of those smaller sharks (although still quite
large) and the whale being of larger size then the shark, large enough for the
whole of the shark to fit in it's belly with minimal chewing, and mostly just
swallowing. Indeed, it would be appropiate to say that the whale swallowed the
shark. Having witnessed this scene from under the water first hand, my breif
out of body experience returned to my body, and I saw the fisherman holding his
pole with all his might, struggling to reel it in, with the tip of the pole
bending in every way, as he wrestled trying to pull the whale in, and he was
wholly dissapointed because he wanted to catch the shark, but he wanted to
salvage his pole now at this point, so he was forced to struggle to reel in the
whale. I then left these fisherman to their task, and continued along the way,
and as I continued along, I saw under this covered area and stopping at the
first sort of stopping point, were Kyle, Mom, and Evan, fishing in the center
with my Dad. The four of them all were there, but Kyle and Mom and Evan only
took notice of me and kept to whatever task they were doing (I don't think they
were all fishing, I know Kyle and Dad were, but I don't know about Mom and
Evan, and I am honesly not even sure thinking on it if they were a part of this
dream at all), but dad stopped me, and wanted to talk with me. What we talked
about, I don't remember, I only remember him holding his pole there, as he was
inbetween casts, and I sat down on the edge so as to conceal my uncomfortable
poop situation from my father as much as possible. After a somewhat breif
conversation that I was not listening to and only making the slightest replies
of, I mentioned that I wanted to go, and my dad let me go, but not before
making a remark to my smell, saying something like "you smell awful. What is
that?" to which I said I have no fucking clue and I got up and left, thinking
only about continuing on this path and looking past it towards a bathroom. And
after examination of the rest of this network beyond this first stop, I saw
multiple "nodes" on this network which were covered fishing nodes, each one
unique in its design and construction, even the bridges between them being
unique also, and I saw a place designed as a restroom a few nodes away. So I
begin making my way towards that direction, but I have to stop at another node
there as well, and as I come up to this node, this one being a sort of circular
node that was covered but was open in all direction except for the bridges that
connected to it, (which both connected to it in one corner of the circle, and I
know circles don't have corners but I mean corner in the sense that only a
small arc of this circle contained the bridges that connected to it and the
rest was open out, not entirely to open water as it faced more of the network,
but to a sort of openening in the network that gave access to a good chunk of
water), and when I came to this node, I examined the family that was fishing on
it to determine that it was Chuck and Michelle and Jessica and Chase. The only
people concerned my coming up to this node were Chuck, who was sitting in the
center of the node on top of what I somehow knew was an expensive ice chest,
and Michelle, who glanced over her shoulder and made an amicable gesture to me.
I stopped there and talked with Chuck for a bit, but not about anything that I
remember but instead just simply a short conversation, and I do remember
Michelle making more than an amicable gesture now that I think about it, but
she offered to give a spot for me if I wanted to join them. I respectfully
declined, and said that I was there more to explore, and I actually inquired to
them that I was looking for a restroom, and I wanted to confirm that the node I
was looking at was indeed a restroom. They replied that yeah, it was, almost in
a sort of way that said, "But why would you want to go there?" but they gave
their confirmation none-the-less, and thanked them and made my way over. As I
walked over there, I looked out to more bridges and more nodes, and at this
point I was getting to the point where I was approaching sort of the far edge
of this network of bridges from my parking location, but not entirely the far
edge, but still I knew I was about as far out as it would get from the parking
location, and I came up close to this outhouse. Now the way this outhouse was
designed, it was an open area, about chest high, with a door on the far end
that I was approaching it, and as I made it there, there was one person there,
I'm not sure if he was waiting for it of if he had just used it, but I felt
comfortable that I could go around him and use this toilet/outhouse area as no
one was using it and he was making no moves to enter it himself. And about the
time I was about to enter it (I didn't even see it in the dream, so I can't
describe what it looked like) I woke up.

Now I do want to say, when I woke up, I had to check myself a bit. I was
wearing loose sweat pants, my pants that have vegas and dice printed on them,
and I did a quick check to make sure they weren't soiled. I have not even to
this point used the restroom, not even to pee now that I think on it, but I do
have to poop a little bit, but not near so much as to warrent this dream.
Rather, I think it represents something, rather than an inclination to need to
poop, but instead it represents my apprehension to engage with others at the
embarrasment of the actions I have made. Indeed, shitting myself is a sort of
metephor that has been used by others to say when someone has fucked up. "He
really shit himself this time" and I think I understand after this dream that
the actual act of shitting myself in the dream came before my realization of
teh phrase, and I only just now remembered the phrase. It could represent my
choices to neglect my work, and in that way I have shit myself, and that is on
my mind, I know, so that could be the source of the dream, but I find it
strange that the main characters of the dream, and the ones I'm most embarresed
to make contact with, are my family and extended family, so I think it might be
a little deeper than this one case that I am failing to work on at work. But I
don't know.

Of the Father of Man

When they had gone through the hermitage, and found all of the belongings of
this man, let it be remembered and kept, the account of the mans notions and
visions of this world that he claims to have found, to have understood as the
real. The truth in these words I leave it to the reader to decide for himself,
for there are many things that some claim to be true, and must be navigated
carefully, but their truth is not always in fact but in their life. So this is
the life of the Father of Man, and the telling of it by the prophet. And so it
begins.

Of the beginning of everything, I wish to tell. Of the nature of man, and of
that which bore into him, which fled into his soul and gave him life, I must
tell of everything, for in this everything else is born. Yes, even God, and
Jesus, and the Devil, these beings, these spirits, these Divine Souls, yes even
Zeus and Hades, and Allah and Yahweh, and so many more that people do not know
about or have not even found to write about, I have seen them all. All, and
one, all from one, they have come. From this One, this way, I wish to speak. In
the beginning of all things, I begin my ramblings.

Oh, who am I, but a simple man of flesh, to have seen these things. To have
seen those spirits of the world where Chaos becomes Stillness, and Death
becomes Life, this upside-down place where no man is meant to go, this place
where time travels not forward or backward or even sideways, this place that
only the most wise and most in-tune of us get to visit. How blessed am I to
have seen it, but how wise I am to know that words will ever and always fail to
describe it in it's glory and justice. For what is this world if not the
embodiment of our ownselves? Indeed, I tell you that all of us, every one of
us, can see it and go there, but so many, only woefully too many of those with
feet that step upon the Earth, the mighty and terrible earth, will seek this
land and even see just a glimpse of it. Is it divine intervention? No, it is
mortal intervention, intervention of the soul, yearning to see that which makes
up the fabric of our existance. I have seen it, I have seen it only through the
lens of my blurred and immortal soul, and how inadequate my soul is to even
begin to attempt to describe this world to others. I tell you, I implore you,
this world cannot be described, it can only be visited. It can be visited by
every soul that has the ability to look into itself and find the world, the
way, the Eternal Way, that which goes beyond this world and into the next. No,
not the next, that is not the word, but the Other. The other. That is the
world. I have been there, and I only pray that my words allow others to go
there with their wisdom, with their soul, for I tell you that all of our souls
are the same, and what is seen in my soul, I that have been blessed with the
clarity of internal sight, who have been blessed with minimal influence of the
outer world, I have been able to see the world of the inner, in it's glory,
it's brightness, it's harmony and discordance of melody, but my vision is only
ever necceisarly imperfect, it is only from one angle that I see this world,
and each of us has our own angle, our own lens, with which we can view this
world, and we can only hope that by each of us sharing this world, and seeing
it, and letting our soul reveal itself to ourselves without intervention, it is
only be seeing this for ourselves, and then later, after seeing it through the
death of the ego and comparing accounts that we will be able to begin to
understand that which goes beyond our human thought. Yes, it is beyond
mortality, but even if this world is greater than any one of us, and perhaps
even all of us as humans, for I tell you everything, everything in this worldly
existance has it's own glimpse, it is only be becoming in tune with this
everything, the everything that is and that speaks to us in our sense, it is
only by touching as many of this everything that we can that we are able to
take glory and wisdom in what is only a fleeting knowledge of that which ties
it all together and weaves it all. And so I share my account, my imperfect,
blurred account that only comes from the angle of one soul, so that others may
see it from their angle and add to it, as we have done and have been doing for
millenia.

Oh, muses of Homer and Virgil, of Dante and Milton, yes, even the muses of
Newton and Einstein, muses of written thought and spoken word, of intellgent
sceintific speech and glorious prose and even the muses of Ceasar or Hitler,
muses of Isaiah or Mohammed or Ghandi or Buddha, those muses who inspire all to
try and bring their perfect vision of this other world into this imperfect one
and as such always neccesarily hit off the mark but always seek to illuminate
that which exists apart from us, oh glorious Muse, guide my words so that I may
bring my vision of this other world also into the hands of man. Let my words
not be final, and let any who seek to give the final account of all be known to
be false in that way, but instead guide my pen as it glides along the page so
that I may speak in a tongue that aims to guide the souls of as many that see
this as possible. O muse, take part of my soul, take me from my fleshly
existance, trancende my ego out of this world so that I may speak clearly and
plainly, without judgement, without preconception. Guide me so that I can
reveal to all the nature of All, the nature of my visions, these visions that
bind us all, that bind everything. Take me O muse!

First I must speak on the nature of these gods. Yes, gods, not God, because God
is simply one amonst these gods. I feel it neccesary to arrive at new name for
the beings, the spirits, the otherworldly that I see, some name other than god
lest I become mistaken for some false prophet, some slanderer who attempts
merely to reitterate the mythologies which have sprung out of our history. But
without another appropiate name coming to mind, let me just simply call them
the gods of the otherworld.

Every feeling, every emotion, and every action by every person or thing (yes,
even thing, no matter how inanimate it may seem) can be told of in the context
of a god. These gods do not have physical bodies or manifistations in this
world as we may think of them, but rather they inhabit an area of the other. A
god, once born, never dies, but will only grow more or less, and this growth
will come about by the comings and goings of our world into theirs. Indeed,
there is no portal from this dimension into that, or any other such nonsense,
there is no physical place that we can visit to find this other; rather, we can
only visit in our mind, and experience what we know to be them.

At this point, you might ask who am I to talk of my thoughts and my visions as
if they are real? But that is the whole crux of my preface, of the false
prophets who seek to bend and force their vision to their own will so that they
might see it. But the true prophet, the prophet who has no attachments to the
physical and wishes only to see this other world as it truely is, without
seeking to distort or morph it into his own conception of what it should be,
this is the kind of prophet I seek to be, and it is only in my words that
another may judge me to be true or false. Indeed, I know for certain that my
visions must be false to some extent, as I must bend them in order to fit them
into the framework of language that we use to share, and of that neccesary
morphing I see no way around, as we all live in this flesh and of the flesh is
how we communicate. So I implore the reader, try and remove the flesh from my
words, and see the visions I see for yourself. Don't let my words impose upon
you the visions that I know you can see, but instead let them guide you and
inspire you to visit this realm for yourself, in truth, so that you may judge
my words for your own.

Indeed, it is because of this history, the history of the gods, that I must
preface my history of the gods so. For in the beginning, there was no god of
Judgement, there was no god of Retribution, or Violence, or even of Love or of
Peace. No, in the beginning, as far as my vision can tell, there was only the
god of Stillness. And I say that only in my vision, for my vision can only go
back so far, as there is no true beginning of these things. Indeed, to say
something about the beginning is absurd, it's a construction of the flesh to
try and make sense of that which we cannot understand. However, as far back as
can be seen by our only so finite souls, the first god of this world was
Stillness. Stillness is empty, it is the vessal through which all things are
filled. It is the Dao that could be talked about in Eastern Religion. It does
not hurt, it does not feel. It has no thoughts, and it has no motive. Indeed,
this god named Stillness is only a god so much in the sense that there must be
some god to describe this concept. This god, Stillness, is the god from which
Chaos is born. And truly I tell you, Chaos is born out of Stillness.

And in this way I must tell you more about the nature of these gods, and more
the nature of this "Other realm" we speak of. The best way I can describe this
realm is in music. When one closes the eyes and listens, not even to a symphony
as that has too much humanity in it, but when one listens to nature, to the
sounds around you, and takes them in without judging them, one can be
transported to a new realm. In this realm, you have no senses, no feeling of
touch or sight or sound, nothing but your own conscious floating in a dream. It
is in this realm that the gods are born. When one feels something move in this
realm, in this state of meditation, that feeling of something is the closest
thing we as mortals of the flesh have to understanding these otherworldly
beings. These beings inhabit us and take us, and most don't think on it or
realize it. It takes great meditative introspection to understand it, and most
refuse to acknowledge that. This is the closest thing we have to seeing these
gods.

But let me tell you, these gods are real. They are real in as much as the grass
you step on is real, or the chirping of the bird in the forest is real. As much
as the love one man can have for a woman is real, these gods are real. Every
feeling, every emotion, however false it may be, is inhabited by these very
real and ever harmonizing gods. You may think my words are not so, but believe
me when I say that the feelings in introspection that one feels can be felt
across the self, without the ego, and without the ego, these gods are only too
real, perhaps even more real than what we may usually consider to be real. What
I speak to you I speak of as my understading of the world, as reality as I
experience it. Do not take this lightly, it is real, and I implore you to
suspend your disbelief so that you can come to understand that with me as well.

And so these gods are born in this realm, and though they may grow and shrink,
they never die. One god can consume another and encapsulate it, but that
original god has not died but merely changed form, it has morphed,
Metaphorphasized as Ovid might say, into another form. And gods are always born
out of another, not through intercourse (as indeed, the concept of intercourse
is a much fleshly one indeed) but through a sort of godly intercourse, through
two gods coming together as one, they not only are able to create something, a
new god out of their union, but also they will lose a part of themselves in
doing so, and in this way, their broader nature is brought into greater
divisions. But this union is never taken lightly, it only comes out of
neccesity. There is no courtship amongst the gods, only the union of them as
the physical requires it. In our own actions, and the actions of all in this
fleshly world that takes place do these gods transform and become changed.

To the skeptics in my audience who might say sadonically, "Oh wise prophet, if
this other world exists, and exists in the same way our world exists today,
then what are it's rules? Does a body in motion stay in motion, and a body at
rest stay at rest in this other world?" To this I say, the point is missed. The
visions of the prophet should not be wasted on finding trivial matters of rules
in this world. That is a devastaing waste of life, and to the person that
wishes to dismiss my visions simply because they do not have well defined
rules, I implore you to attempt to open your soul, not your mind but yes, your
soul, to my teachings, so that you may visit there yourself, because I know in
my heart that any soul can find it in themselves to visit, and when you visit
tell me if you still wish to know the rules of this world. If you visit, and
you say, "Yes, I would like to know the rules of this otherworld" still then
you have missed all of the other beauty and knowledge that can be gained from
the mere experience of the other. And perhaps you truly did experience all of
teh beauty and knowledge, and you have exhausted your interest in those aspects
of what I am to say to you, and if you have somehow managed to do that you are
truly more wise and connected than I can even begin to fathom, and if even
still at that point you wish to define the rules, than as one who is clearly
above myself in these matters, as a god amongst men (which such a thing is not
meant to exist) you may begin to define the rules for yourself.  But until
then (and then will never come to be I feel in my heart) I will only say that
the rules of this world are entirely secondary to the understanding of the
world.

And to those who say, "Wise sage, I have read your teachings, and I have
visited this world, but the world I visited was not like yours, but instead of
a forest where you describe a forest I saw a mountain, and instead of a god
where you saw a god I saw a tree" and etc and etc. for all the discrepancies
between your experience and mine, I say this. These discrepencies, if the world
you visited truely is the world that I visited, are merely discrepencies in the
flesh, in the manifestation of your experince of the world in comparison to
mine rather that differences in the world. Truely, we are all the product of
our enviorment, myself as any other, and our environment is what gives us these
visions. Indeed, it would be a great feet if you were able to see what I saw
exactly as I saw it, for that would be that you lived a life exactly as I lived
it, which would be a remarkable feature of our two lives being connected in
that way. You can see how absurd that would be, how maginificently impossible,
for two beings to share the exact same life experience. Indeed, truely that is
impossible, and though I do not know this to be true entirely, for I take
nothing to be the absolute truth, I know it it my heart that no two beings,
indeed, not even the smallest of quarks, would share the exact some experinces
in their life times, but instead each is taken as its own and is entirely
unique to itself.

This is why I speak of lenses and angles, when viewing this otherworld. I can
only visit and observe this world through my lens, and from my vantage point,
and you can only visit this world from your lens and your vantage point, and
this world is unique in that the lens and the vantage point don't obey the
standard rules of optics and vision of our world of light and sound. Indeed, I
hope I have impressed on you that the concepts of light and optics are complete
absurdities in this otherworld, but instead the visions and the sights and the
experinces had as they are described is merely the only way that we know how to
communicate these things to eachother, so let us communicate in that way so
that we may come to understand eachother. In fact, we must communicate with
eachother, as I truely believe that the only way to got the most complete sense
of this world is through communication and attempted understanding of all that
there is in this world.

So at this point, I want to cut off my ever haughty and pompous talk of "the
otherworld" to return to the disscussion of things more appropiate for a
journal entry. In fact, to say I am cutting it off is maybe inappropiate, that
is what should be done with journal entries like this, I think, and if at some
point I wish to continue than I will. Well, enough of that.

Last night I know I had a dream, and I know it involved my hair in some way,
but I don't remember it very clearly and am quite honestly not concerned with
it. Instead, I want to talk about the conversation I had with Michelle
yesterday.

So yesterday was a sort of interesting day for me. It started with my waking
up, hoping that I had slept through yoga (I think I wrote about this already)
but when I had realized I hadn't, instead of deciding to sleep through it I
decided I would do the responsible thing and cancel my appointment
(appointment?) for the class that day. So after doing that, I wrote about my
dream, and then I followed that up by listening to the podcast between Rogan
and Peterson. You see, I was feeling in one of my depressive moods that day,
feeling like "all of this is pointless" but at the same time know that that was
just my depressive self talking, and I thought about what I would do, so I
decided to listen to the podcast, and it was exactly what I needed I think. And
it wasn't exactly what I needed in terms of "oh it turned my life around"
because that's not what I think this is about, but instead it was just a gentle
reminder to me that these things happen, and that I should ride it out and make
the best of it. In the podcast, Peterson talked about the concept of setting
the bar substancially low enough to be able to reach it, and that is something
that in these moments of depression I tend to forget, and I always set the bar
just a little too high, and I decide it would be better to do nothing than to
fail to reach that bar, so as I was listening, I started to do some of my
dishes which had been piling up, and I rearranged my living area a bit so that
I could vacuum it and make it a little more "fresh" like I like to do at times,
and as I listened to the podcast I started to practice one of Chopin's etude,
the C# minor one that I kind of know, and in general, while it didn't do much
in the way of helping me "find my purpose" or anything so silly like that,
those little things really do go a long way to helping out when I get in that
mood. And the fact that yesterday was a day off, and I had all the time in the
world to do these little things helped. You see, this is something that I have
noticed before, but when you only have a short ammount of time to do these
little tasks, they feel rushed and almost painful in a way, but when I was able
to spend as much time I wanted cleaning the dishes, I was able to really just
do them as I felt. In fact, what I ended up doing was first collecting all of
the dishes, and placing them next to the sink, and once I had a sort of catalog
of all the dirty dishes that were there, and I had enough time to evaluate
honestly that this was the full of the catalog (as opposed to shoving some
dishes off to the side or into some obscure corner of the kitchen as I
sometimes do when I am dishonest about it), I was able to then take each dish
one at a time, and determine the best method of cleaning it. So some of the
silverware simply required a quick rinse and squeeze of the sponge, and after
evaluating each piece and holding it up to the light I determined that it was
quite clean in the first place and didn't need any more fine detail work, but
when I got to my quart sized plastic cups, I did a full pat down of them inside
and out, and determined that some of them had quite a bit of leftover milky
residue on them and in them, so after determining this, I was able to take my
sponge, and fill them with a bit of water, and thouroughly wash through them,
scrubbing every little corner and edge with maticulous precision, as I took
each one and determined quite satisfactorily that I had cleaned it quite
thouroughly, and taking each cup in this way, I would set them to the side to
be dried. And as I took the towel that I use to dry them, I determined that
they were not becoming as dry as I might like, so instead of putting them in
the pantry still partially wet like I do sometimes, I decided to pull out a new
towel from my drawer of towels, and see if that new towel would make them any
more dry than the one I know I haven't washed in at least a few weeks. And as
it turns out, the new towel did indeed make them quite a bit more dry than the
unclean one, so I put the unclean towel in the washing machine, with the other
dirty laundry that I wanted to get to after this, and I began using the new
towel. I then proceeded to do this with the other towel in my kitchen, so I
replaced both of them. Then, when everything was dry and put in it's proper
place, I proceeded to go into the refridgerator and throw out a couple of items
that I knew had been in there a while, and that I had been neglecting to throw
away. There were some sausage and eggs leftover from I honestly don't know how
long ago when I visited my parents and made some sausage and eggs and they
weren't received by anyone there to have for breakfast, so I took them home and
I know I ate them each once after that, but they had become quite moldy and
such, so I emptied the contents into the trash bag that I had set next to the
door to take out, and cleaned the containers and placed them in my cabinet in
the containers. To be entirely honest, I do not know how long all of this took
me, but I was listening to the Peterson podcast all the while and taking as
much time as I wanted to do each of these small little tasks, and by the end of
it I took a portabello cap and spread some avocado on it, and sat down in the
chair next to my speakers and continued to listen to the podcast while eating
my noontime snack that I have been having since I started experimenting with
intermettant fasting. And after I was finished, I continued to sit there, and I
did nothing more, until I arrived in my bathroom to take a piss, and I saw my
pipe sitting in a ziploc bag filled with salt and alcohol, and I know that it
has been sitting there for at least a week by this point, so I emptied the
contents of the bag into the toilet, and thouroughly washed through the pipe
with water, and took it out and left it to dry there sparkling as clean as new.
I then brought myself into the shower, and rinsed myself off for a bit, brushed
my teeth after drying myself, and at around this point I sat down and worked a
bit on my Russian trainer. I am not at all satisfied with how it turned out,
and indeed I knew that it wouldn't be what I wanted it to be from the get go,
but it was not at all satisfactory at all, but that is a topic for another day.
At this point, I decided to lie down and take a quick nap. It was two o'clock,
the time when I wish at work that I could take an afternoon nap but am never
allowed to (I have been absconded in the past for taking naps, so instead now I
simply sit and stare at my desk for about an hour when I wish I could simply
crawl under my desk for twenty minutes instead, so whatever) and I determined
to take a good 20 minute nap.

Well, when I woke up I checked the time and determined it to be two entire REM
cycles later at five o'clock. I was of course surprised at this, as I had not
intended to hit even one REM cycle, and I swore at myself for a moment before
deciding that it was okay. All this time through the day, I had been checking
my phone a few times to see if I was getting any messages from anyone, and I
had not been, so I got up and proceeded to do not much of anything productive
for the next hour or so. Indeed, it was six o'clock when I decided to make a
sandwich, and as I was making a sandwich, I heard my phone vibrate on the
counter, and I checked it and found that it was Michelle texting me and my
brothers, asking if we wanted to go out for food. I replied that "Yeah, I would
like that" right as Kyle replied that he was chilling at the hospital, and
after some interaction, I decided to continue making my half made sandwich and
eat it because I needed to eat a lot of food anyway, before I decided to make
the decision to meet at twisted root. The plan then being to wait for Kyle to
text when he was leaving, I immediately went outside even as we were still
making plans, and placed my phone next to my marker for the beginning of my
running distances, and began running back and forth, keeping strong control of
my breath as I started at 6-2 In-Out breathing pace, and sped to 4-2 and
sometimes 3-2 or 3-1 pace occasionally, but staying at a pretty steady 4-2
pace. I jogged back and forth for two miles this way, intending to only run a
mile at first but extending my length first by a half a mile when I reach a
mile, and then another half mile when I reached 1.5, and when I finished I
picked up my phone and saw two missed calls from Kyle. I immediately called him
back to talk with him. Apparently, he had something in mind, a greek place that
was more centrallized, and I said if he wanted to mention that he wanted to go
there instead, we could, and that I really had no desire to go to Twisted Root
beyond the simple fact that Michelle mentioned burgers and I wanted to come to
a decision sooner rather than later. Regardless, I took my shower, and a few
minutes after that I got the text and made my way to Twisted Root.

Upon getting there, I met Michelle and Evan, and Kyle converged about the same
time, and we ordered and began talking about things. We had a very pleasent
conversation, the four of us, but I realized that I tended to dominate most of
the conversation, indeed, Kyle did talk a little, and Evan talked very little
at all like he usually does, and thinking back on the conversation now, I spoke
for most of it. Although, that is not entirely true, as the most pleasent part
of the conversation was my inquiring of Michelle about how her and Chuck met,
and how their relationship evolved, so I was not entirely selfish in the
conversation. Regardless, we talked a bit about our dad, as we all agreed that
we were (or at least I said this and everyone tended to at least understand
completly) more concerned for my mom than we were for my dad, as she is being
very almost possessive of him, not wanting to accept help from others and not
knowing how to accept help from others. After talking a bit about that, we
transitioned to the typical "how is work going" conversation, to which Kyle and
I gave our accounts of our job and Evan remained quiet in his corner as he
always does. Then after we talked about that a little bit, Michelle talked a
bit about how she is "weddinged out" for the time being, as she mention Jaq and
then her sister Steph, both having weddings recently, and then we went to the
true heart of the conversation and what I truly enjoyed about it, which was her
inquiry of our relationship status. And this is where the conversation really
took place, where we talked a little bit about Jess's relationship with her new
boyfriend, before talking about how our relationship status today. And this is
when the conversation led to the topic of Michelle meeting Chuck, and how that
happened. To give a quick recount of how she told it, Michelle mentioned that
in school, she had a few groups of friends (as most people do), and how there
were three guys that she was good friends with, who she would hang out with on
the reg, and another group of three roommates that those roommates were friends
with, that she knew of but didn't know very well. And so she mentioned one
time, when they were all hanging out, Chuck was there, and she had known him
before but never interacted with him, and interacting with him and everyone
there, she came to a liking for him. And after that she mentioned to her
friends of the first group that she did take a liking to him, and those friends
were very much interested in playing wingman for her, and were receptive to it,
but she also talked about how she was so brutally scared of mentioning it
because she didn't want to be that girl that hangs out with a bunch of guys and
then becomes involved with one of them in a sort of fling, and she knew how
they talked and how she would be crucified if she fucked it up, but she had to
chase him a bit. And then she said, after she had expressed her liking of him,
and she knew that he knew it, how he continued to give her the cold shoulder,
to play hard to get in a way. She saw him, and he would see her, going to and
from classes and to and from the bus or the parking lot, and they might make
eye contact, but he would ignore her, and it got to a point where after a few
weeks of this, with them hanging out with their group of mutual friends and
still being of course amicable with eachother, she talked about how she almost
got the point of saying, "well to hell with him then" but they ended up going
on a date, and from there the rest is history as they say. She talked about
this with a great glow in her eyes, of her early relationship with Chuck, you
could see the love and the passion. We then took this conversation to go into
the concept of dating, and not dating in the sense of "this date should be
considered as the prospective one" but instead in the sense of "this is
practice dating" and while I very much agree, we talked then about the
difficulty that guys have now in finding a date. We also mentioned (I also
mentioned) that our mom was very much opposed to the idea of us interacting
with girls in any way, especially not in a romantic way, through even high
school, and how because of that we really missed out on a lot of the young love
dating that a lot of people go through, and that I would very much like to get
into this practice dating. I also mentioned, as I have mentioned to other
before though, how I don't know what avenue I want to use in order to get into
this world of practice dating, and after talking with Michelle, she mentioned
how she knows that Jaq has quite a lot of friends, and that while she herself
has to put great effort into interacting with others, she feels that it simply
comes naturally to Jaq, and that she would put Jaq on it. We then talked about
the camp, and now the ranch (which I have yet to visit) and the whole takeaway
of the entire conversation to me was, I will plan to visit the camp this Fourth
of July weekend just to interact with everyone there. In particular, I want to
get into fishing and hunting and all of those sorts of "outdoorsy" things, and
I want to get involved with Parker, as Parker seems like a good guy to know
when it comes to these things, so the bottom line of my conversation with
Michelle is, I want to make an effort to connect with Parker with the purpose
of both getting more involved with outdoors things and also to increase my
friend circle. As Yash told me, I should meet 10% more people every month, so
this I feel is my best effort to do that.

# 20180706
Okay, so as of this moment in time, it is in the afternoon, I am conflicted. So
today is Friday, and like any good Friday I decided to go to open mat. Well,
while I was at open mat, I rolled with a lot of people, as I do, and I tapped
to every one of them. That is, I went in with the intention of learning rather
than the intention of trying to tap people. Well, I must be a moron, because my
very last roll, I rolled with a guy, and I wish I could remember his name, it
was something unique, but for the life of me I can't remember, but regardless,
I rolled with him, and at first, by his demeanor and the way he was holding
himself, I thought him to be a brown belt or at least purple belt, but as I
started rolling with him I found a lot of holes in his game, he seemed
unconfident in his guard top game, and I ended up in closed guard quite easily,
and I was able to manipulate his limbs quite at my whim. Well, at this point I
went for an armbar, and it was quite deep, but he was able to get a good gable
grip to save it, and at that point I could have really pulled on it to try and
finish it, but I decided it wasn't worth the time, so I returned to guard and
kept playing. I was able to break his posture, and play with him, and at that
moment I felt as though I could do some super cool spinny shit that I was
literally just making up on the spot. So I sat up, to do the super cool spinny
shit, but he stood up as well and we ended up standing and my super cool spinny
shit ended with me in turtle and him attacking my back. Well, that is obviously
not where I wanted to be, but we played there for most of the match, me trying
to do things from turtle, and he made it to side mount but it was a sort of
shitty side mount (in comparison to Troy earlier who had me in a very strong
side mount that ended with a head in arm choke that almost put me to sleep) and
I was able to recover guard easily. And so we are back in guard, and I hear the
thirty second buzzer, and that is when my ego kicked in. I thought about how
much this guy must think I suck, because he was attacking me from turtle the
entire time, and I thought about how, if this were a match, he would have been
up for sure on points, and I felt again the arm bar, so I went for it again. It
was the same arm as the first one, and he saved himself with the same gable
grip, but it felt deep, and it was the end of the round, so this one I decided
to really pull on, and I pulled on it for quite some time, and as I was pulling
on it, just before the final time went off, I felt something in my spine right
where it meets the hip come out of place. I have felt it before many months ago
going for a triangle on the big guy whose name is escaping me, and this time
was no different. Well, I came back to guard, but I immediately knew that I had
pulled some kind of muscle in my low back there, and the time stopped maybe 5
seconds later, and I thanked him as best I could and went to turtle to try and
alleviate the pressure. I then hobbled to the restroom, took my shower, and did
my best to move as slowly as possible so as not to hurt it.

I tell of this story for a few reasons. One, it goes to show that as much as I
think my ego is gone, it still decides to intrude itself, and it always does so
in these awful ways that end with some aspect of my body getting hurt. Two, I
was just thinking about only yesterday how grateful I am to be young, and how
grateful I am that my body can recover from my foolishness so well, and how
important it is to train for my fifty year self rather than my tomorrow self.
How ironic that this would happen not even 24 hours after that thought. Three,
I have entirely reconsidered going to Houston for the Fourth celebration.

You see, this morning, only this morning, I have packed all of my things, and
arranged it all nice and neat in my bags, and gotten a few pairs of underwear,
and some jeans, and some sleep shorts, and all of the other assorted things
that go into packing for a trip that would last one day and two nights. I even
went back to my apartment after this mornings training with Paco, and grabbed
some towels which I had forgotten, and a fresh gi in case I wanted to visit an
open mat in Houston on Saturday. I have everything prepared, and the plan was
this morning to leave for Houston immediately after work. Now, though, I have
entirely reconsidered that plan, for a few reasons. The first and most
practical is, I very much do not want to drive in the car with my low back in
the state that it is right now. Not only will it not be comfortable, but also
it will not be the best idea to constrain myself to that level of treatment to
something which is important. Indeed, if I am careful about it and treat it
well, by back will be mostly recovered by the morning, with proper care and
mobility treatment, but if I lock it into the sitting position, while it
certainly won't become anything permanent or anything crazy like that, it will
take longer to recover, and I don't want that. But the other reason is, and
this is something that I didn't really think about, but when I talked with
Michelle about this weekend, and I thought about it, she has mentioned that it
will be a lot of Jaq and Jess's friends, and as I said before, I do want to be
able to interact with Parker and Chuck more, as both of them are very outdoorsy
types and I want to get more into the outdoorsy stuff, but when it comes to the
inteactions that are going to be going on at the camp, I will be very out of
place in the sense that it will be a bunch of people that know eachother, and
then me, and while I am sure that I will be able to occupy myself at the camp,
I certainly do not want to go there feel ostracized by these girls and boys.
Indeed, I am in a sort of strange spot where I don't fit in with the kid crew
anymore, but I don't quite fit in with the adults, at least not in the sense
that I think. But all of this is simply me coming up with excuses not to go
now. You see, I was all prepared and ready to leave immediately after work
today, but this popping of my low back (not popping, but rather straining) has
somehow brought into my head all sorts of excuses to change my mind. It's quite
amazing how the brain is able to do that. When I was in physical form to make
the car ride, I was ready to go, but now all I can think of is my back, and how
it feels, and working on mobilizing it and taking care of it. Which is all the
right thing to do. But it's not until that physical manifestation of an
legitimate reason not to go appears that I start to come up with the other
reason why I don't want to go. It's a very interesting phenomenon, and one that
I have not thought about before, and could be a very interesting idea for some
characters to go through. All of this is quite interesting to me.

At this point, I think the best course of action would be this. I should text
Michelle, and let her know my course of action, saying something like how I
thought about coming to the camp this weekend but have passed, but how I would
like to know when people are doing things, and then I could perhaps get from
her hopefully Parker's number, or at the very least some sort of snapchat or
groupme group or something that I could become a part of that I know they use
to communicate when they do things, and then I could become a part of that and
aim to visit Houston more often, or the Ranch which is off of Austin I think,
and in that way I could get more connected with Parker and start to have things
to do with people more. Because stuff like yoga is great, but there is no
"fishing club" that I could become a member of and just start showing up to,
and even if there were, I don't know if I would really want to become a member
of something like that. I mean, I would certainly go for a trial or something,
and from there who knows, but the entire discussion is pointless since there
isn't such a thing.

So I think the course of action is this. I will go to my apartment, eat a bunch
of the beef that I bought yesterday (which I think I have found as the god send
of foods, I bought some marbled steaks for four bucks a pound, which is totally
reasonable, and once I get the art of cooking it down, it will be really good.
I took down two slabs yesterday, which comes out to be about a pound, and I
could have gone for maybe even a little more. On top of that, cooking it was
literally a matter of heating up some oil in a pan and searing it for legit
three minutes, and it had a nice rare center and while it was a touch chewy and
could have been a little more tender, it went down effortlessly) and after or
before or during that, I will spend the rest of the evening mobizing my back
and downing Ibuprofin like it's candy. Then from there, I will read some, or
watch some, or maybe watch some as I mobilize and read some after, go to sleep
in the comfort of my apartment, and decide when I wake up what I want to do. I
know certainly I want to visit my father some time this weekend, especially if
I am to forgoe my trip to Houston, but I don't know when exactly I would intend
to do that.

Something I do want to say, I have neared the end of three and a half straight
weeks of Bikram. I missed a Saturday, and then with the Fourth, I decided to
just cut it there. I will say this. Doing it everyday is a struggle in a few
ways. The first is, you really have to keep on top of the laundry, and the
water intake and all of the management of the schedule required to get to and
from the studio. That shit isn't hard, but it's still a part of the struggle.
That, on top of the fact that sixty minutes is not a short ammount of time, and
when it's all said and done, it eats up a good two hours of the day that could
have been spent cooking, or reading, or any other activity that you could
imagine. Secondly, another difficulty is that none of the days ever become a
good day. Yes, there are certainly days that are better than others, but I
noticed after taking a two day break and coming back to it on a third day after
that (72 hours between sessions) I was much more mentally able to get myself
into the zone, that zone where every posture you hit your edge, and you are
able to feel as though you are gaining something out of it rather than just
doing it because you are obligated to. Doing it every day in a row, I started
to feel that most days became the "okay, I'm here just to do the best that I
can with my body right now" rather than the "wow, I feel good today, and I want
to be here and I am genuinely curious about what I can do today with my body
right now", and there are certainly days where the former will be the case no
matter how you practice (and that's true of anything) but I noticed after only
two days break, I had felt that I hadn't had one of those days in a long time,
and I felt fresh and ready and excited to do the work. Now, you could argue
that I had hit that only because I did have so many maintainence days in a row,
and the special day is a tribute to the high volume work at it's best. In fact,
now that I think on it, that is most definitely what happened. However, there
must certainly be a balance, and more for the first reason I mentioned rather
than the second do I feel that Bikram yoga every day is tough. It's just a lot
of time out of the day, and I have other things that I want to do other than
practice 26 postures sometimes.

The last thing I want to say about Bikram every day is that I feel that
sometimes I just want to flow, and doing Bikram every day leaves no days to
dedicate to just flowing. In fact, now that my low back is in the state it is,
I very much want to have a "just flow" day to work on it, and I am greatly
looking forward to that this evening. The 26 postures, all the same in the same
order with no variation, not even mixing up which side you do first, it get's
wearisome and dull, and while it's good in the sense of being the other extreme
of my criticism of Crossfit, you could argue that Crossfit is good in being the
other extreme of my criticism of Bikram, so there has to be a balance there
that I can strike by not dedicating myself to Bikram and instead treating it as
another tool (which I have been doing, but it's very difficult to see it that
way when you do it every fucking day). Enough on that.

{Actor:.}
Okay, so today has been a weird day for me so far. I can honestly say that I
haven't done much of anything since the day started, but I feel as though I
somehow have done a lot of things. To recap what I have done today.

During the night, I know I had a dream. I know this dream was interesting,
because I remember waking up to a half awake half asleep state, and thinking
about how I was a little excited because I had a good dream, and that I knew it
still wasn't time to wake up yet, but that I should remember the dream when I
do and promptly go to write it down. Well, many hours later after sleeping some
more, I didn't dream any more and I entirely forgot what the dream was. So that
was that.

The second thing I remember is coming to the realization that my low back was
not feeling any better than it was the day before, and in fact was about the
same level of shitiness. As I started to move around, and get up, I quickly
determined that it was indeed no better, and I got up and paced for a bit
resenting this fact. I popped some more ibuprofin (which I will do again after
I finish writing here) and continued to walk around a bit, thinking about how
much I wanted to smoke some weed, thinking about how much more aware and how
much more able I would be to treat it if I could only smoke some marijuana.
Fuck me there too man.

Thirdly, I spent some time edging myself to pictures of women on reddit. It was
nothing too extreme, but I definitely did some legitmate masterbating. In fact,
even just talking about it right now is making me uneasy, and I am finding
myself wanting to return and do it again. But we are not doing that, we are
writing instead.

Fourthly, I constructed an even warlock deck in Hearthstone and played a bit of
that. I am currently at rank shit tier this season (rank 23 and up) and have
had 100 % success with this deck so far. Of course, when I actually start
playing against not rank shittier, I do not know how it will go, but that is
taht.

Lastly, and in my time leading up to this journal article, I screwed around on
D3 with Evan a bit, since I saw he and Kyle were playing it, and I decided to
get on just for the shits and giggles. It was interesting enough, but it was
mostly just running around asking about the new game mechanics and things like
that.

So all of that to say, I don't know what to make of myself this morning and
day. I think I have decided to give up PBJ all-together, especially in the
mornings. I hate I don't know how much steak last night, but I was still hungry
when I woke up today, and I have eaten two PBJ's and I think I have finally
made the association of PBJ and this sort of apthetic, easily distracted, brain
weary state that I am in right now. I can't seem to concentrate on any one
topic for very long, and when I try to I seem to sit here in a blurry haze of
just, I don't know what. Something in the combination of bread, PBJ, and milk,
puts me in this state. I think it might me wise at this point to simply cut the
bread alltogether, and the milk, and the PBJ, and try strictly eating an
omnivore diet, and by that I mean meat and veggies. It is too easy for me to
reach for PBJ in times of hunger and boredom like this, and I think that it
might be the source for a lot of shit for me in my life, so I have decided to
cut it. I am not sure if I would like to cut milk at this point as well, but I
certainly think that these marbled beef cuts that I have found at Sam's could
very well be the solution to a lot of other things that are shitty in my life
right now.

In fact, I find this quite interesting that I have this perception that I have
a lot of shitty things in my life right now. I think it is the food that I have
eaten talking. Right now (and it is the mid-afternoon mind you, and this is
something that happens at this point anyway), I have this strong urge to not
do anything productive at all, as if doing something productive would hurt me
right now, as if doing something like rotating my laundry and cleaning my gi
would somehow be a detriment to my life. In fact, I am quite forcing myself to
continue on writing right now, where if I were to give in to my impulses, I
would be browsing reddit or playing more games of Hearthstone mindless or any
other such pointless task, but instead I am very much forcing myself to keep
writing because I have decided that is what I want to do right now. I keep
glancing down at the clock in the corner of my monitor to see it to be only a
few minutes past the previous time that I looked down at it, and every time I
do so I get this entire sense of dread as though I won't be able to last
another fourty minutes of writing, which if I would seek to aim to get to my
desired goal of one hour of writing a day I would have to reach at this moment
in order to accomplish.

On that subject also, I dread the idea of picking up any book and reading it.
Even just the concept of having something in front of me to process and
comprehend is too much for me right now. I don't give a shit about Achilles in
the Iliad, I don't care if Aeneis makes it to Rome, I couldn't give a flying
fuck about whether or not Mitya is going to kill his father, and Vin and her
magical metal burning powers can go fuck themselves. However, when it comes to
mindlessly watching clickbait youtube videos where people take excerpts from
other peoples channels and put them on their own, that is something I can get
behind. This is something I have always struggled with. Why is it that I feel
comfortable wasting my time doing something that is entirely unproductive, but
at the same time I won't spend that same time doing something productive like
learning Russian, or writing (which I am very much forcing myself to continue
to do right now) or playing the piano, or visiting my father, or anything else?
Why is it that I will stay awake consuming mindless fodder that I know will get
me nowhere in life (or at least, the intention is that it will do nothing for
me) but I won't spend that same time to something that my produce fruit in the
end? Both this writing, and the watching youtube videos each take a minimal
amount of effort. In fact, I could simply have the textbook of Russian words
and shit just open, and I could read the words, and try and pronounce them, and
that would take no more effort on my part than figruing out games of
Hearthstone would, or calculating gear scores or whatever it is in Diablo, but
for some reason I feel compelled to spend my time on the latter rather then the
former. What is that?

I am somewhat convinced, or at least hopeful, that it has to do with the sugars
in the PBJ and milk that I just ate. In fact, not only sugars, but maybe also
whatever processed fats and shit goes into the peanut butter that I ate as
well. I do not beleive it has anything to do with the ibuprofin I have taken,
as Ibu. has never had this effect on me in the past, at least not that I've
noticed. More the reason I can rule out Ibu. is because I have had this sort of
effect on my brain before, and I very much know that I have felt this way
before, and so I feel like it has to have something to do with something that I
have always done. I feel like it has to be diet.

The first time I remember distincly identifying this feeling was in college.
And I know I have had this feeling many times before this moment, but this was
the first moment I remember putting it into my brain. The first time I remember
experiencing this feeling was when I was watching a Carlin standup video, and
as I was listening to the words, it was as if the words were coming at me after
I could process them. It was like he was saying things, and the things he was
saying weren't reaching me until way after he said them, but by the time they
reached me he was already saying different things, and I just couldn't keep up
with what he was saying, and I eventually turned off the video. Now, at the
time of that, I believe I was high, so I attributed that feeling to the feeling
of being high, but now I think I am coming to the realization that that feeling
probably has to do with what I've eaten, and there is no doubt in my mind that
it is very likely that I had eaten a PBJ before that moment of first realizing
about this feeling. So knowing that now, I will entirely cut the PBJ from my
life and the bread and the milk, and work on eating only beef, veggies,
mushrooms, and water and tea from this point forward, and through changing my
diet in that way, I will determine observe if my feelings of discondcordance
has to do with diet or if it has to do with something else. Indeed, it might
just be something that happens to me, but when it happens it doesn't usually
have this sort of effect on me. Right now it feels as though it is having an
actual physical effect on me, and its making me upset and irritated. I am
feeling like the entire act of writing right now is draining me physically. And
it's not the actual act of pressing the keys that's draining me, it just feels
like the fact that I am continuing to type, and the fact that I know I will
plan to continue to type for some amount of time, it is making me wearisome and
filled with dread. Indeed, I don't know how many words I have typed since I
mentioned that I had forty minutes to go, but it feels like I have been saying
words and words and words and words, and that no matter how much I type there
is still just a mountain more that I am going to have to type, and it has only
been fifteen minutes since that point and I feel like I haven't accomplished
anything with it and that there is still this mountain to overcome.

I will take a break and drink some water, because I know I am dehydrated as
well.

Okay, I got up and had some water and have set the pitcher to start filling up
with some more water. I will plan to go back in a few sentences and drink some
more. Just that walking up and drinking some water already made me feel
slightly better, and there is some meta analysis that I want to talk about in
regards to the story of the hermit, so by the time I am finished writing this
paragraph, the pitcher should have finished filling and I will be able to go
and drink a bunch of water, and bring the pitcher with me, and drink out of the
pitcher in a steady pace while I write.

I just went to check on the pitcher, and it is not done filling, but is still
draining through the filter and into the pitcher. Indeed, I don't want to
start writing on any chain of thought, because I so hate having my chains of
thought become inturrupted by things such as getting up to grab water, so that
is the purpose of this paragraph, to give myself more time as filler in between
the grabbing of the water and the actual writing of my ideas.

Okay, I'm back now with the pitcher of water in front of me. I will say that
the feeling of the feeling going away was merely psycho somatic, as I can
garuntee that the feeling is still there. However, having some water certainly
helps that feeling, and I feel as more towards the end of the spectrum of
"doing productive things is not painful" anymore, and less on the rather
strange end of "doing productive things is pointless and painful and not worth
it". So let's talk about the tale of my hermit.

So far, what my idea of the tale of the hermit has come to is this. I have my
four characters, one of which is a brutish man, the sort of man who is an
aggressive athiest, and will justify his contempable actions by saying things
like "well if there is no god that means we can do whatever we want with no
consequences". And I want my intelligent and open Christian to be a girl. What
sort of girl this is I do not know yet. There are two ways I could go with
this, and one would be that this girl is a sort of "born-again" Chirstian, and
that she used to live a sinful or dreadful life, perhaps burdened by addiction
or promiscuosness (which is certainly a female sin much more than it is a male
one) or some other such thing and that she found Christianity and through that
she found her ways. I think this would make more sense as the dogmatic
Christian, which would make the most sense since this is the one I would have
be the most tied to her faith. So that has those two characters pretty well
defined in an extremely broad sense.

For the other two characters, I want to have the open minded athiest or
agnostic be a male, and the open minded Christian be a female. I really like
the idea of the open minded Christian being someone who was born in raised in a
good household, having the sort of parents that were also Christian, but they
were the good sorts of Christians who would go to church but would always let
their daughter decide if she wanted to join them on Sunday's or whatever. And
maybe I could talk about how on some Sundays she decided not to go, simply
because she didn't feel like it or whatever, but she always felt guilty about
it, and even more so because it seemed like her parents were perfectly happy
with her not going, and in their abscence she could feel the presence of god
speak within her, and the devil, rather just the devil, and she could feel the
devil work within her, and she would feel great guilt at her decision, as if
she were turning her back on god. She could even have a moment in one of these
times where she looked upon a cross or something else that was displayed in
their house, and upon looking at the cross she would feel great anguish, as if
she herself were guilty for the death of Jesus, as the church would have us
believe. So that would be the story for my open Christian character.

And that leaves lastly the Agnostic, or the Open Athiest, or whatever other
Character. This Character I want to have the background be very similar to
mine, with parents that were horrible Christians, and he constantly had
Christianity shoved down his throat. He went through a period of rebellion, and
contempt for the world, he went and lived in his car in Seattle and got
involved with pchedelics, and through that he has kept an open mind about all
religion, but only to the extent that the religion will match with what he
knows about the world. This Character might say something like "The fact that
there is an invisible man in the sky that created us is no more unreasonable
than the idea that we all were born up out of the chaos of the universe, and
the facts of these matters on obscures the hidden truth which is what we should
all strive to find" or something like that.

And now that I have these four characters, somewhat fleshed out but not in an
entirely satisfactory manner, I lastly want to talk about the hermit. I still
haven't decided what I want this "manifesto of the hermit" to be. What I have
written above, a few days ago, talking about spirits and gods, leading up to
the spirit of Adam which is the spirit I first want to create in my mythology
as the spirit or god that brought life into man, and is the father of all the
other gods, does not fit into the original idea of this story. The original
idea of the story was that this hermit wrote this manifesto, or his magnum
opus, or whatever, in the isolation of his cottage, and in this magnum opus,
the idea was that he had visions of this other world, and in this other world,
he was able to make predictions about this world. The idea of the story then,
is that all of these characters would read this magnum opus, these visions,
ramblings of a hermit, whatever you want to call them, and after they had read
them they became entirely true, undeniably true, to the point where it would be
unreasonable not to accept the ramblings of the hermit to be the actual nature
of the universe. The idea then is that, in this sort of undeniable evidence, I
want to show the reactions and interactions of my four characters as they try
and cope with and understand what they have read.

I like this concept and I don't all at the same time. On the one hand, it could
make for an interesting read. On the other hand, it seems much too cute.
Perhaps what I have to do is make the ramblings of the hermit seperate from my
mythology. Because I have a great love for mythology in my mind, I always have
since the first time I read of the greeks and the greek myths, and I don't want
it to be reduced to this sort of "undeniable truth". Such a reduction is for
things like physics, things that you can make experiments for and such. So
perhaps these ramblings of the hermit, maybe it has to be entirely seperate.

And I guess that's where I am struggling. In another sense, this mythology I
have in my head has to do with a sort of fantasy world that I want to create.
Indeed, the Iliad very much takes place in a fantasy world, especially in the
sense that the gods actually interact with the regular man, and while I do have
something like that in my mind as to what I want my story and my mythology to
be, to mix it up with this sort of ramblings of the hermit seems wrong. Before
I begin to write on this story, I need to straighten out in my head what the
world of the hermit should be, what the world of my mythology is, and if they
should intersect at all.

I think what makes the most sense is to write a sort of writers epilogue. I
deem it important to provide a commentary in addition to the story. Such a
thing could work, I think, as I feel it is neccesary due to the absurdness of
the story. It goes against the "show don't tell" principle of writing, but in
this case I think, since this story will be much too cute otherwise, I deem it
neccesary to talk about the absurdity of a hermit coming up with the meaning of
the universe and being able to write it down.

So to summarize my meta-brainstorming on this subject, what I am left with is
this. I want there to be a Hermit, and this Hermit writes a document detailing
out the nature of the world. One of the critical features of this document will
be the renouncement of Christianity as a valid system, and the proposition of
some other sort of god. In this ficional world (very fictional, that will have
to be noted in the commentary just how absurdly fictional this sort of scenario
is) this hermit has actually visited another realm, and in this realm he met an
actual being, and the being proved to him that the entire things was real by
giving him a sequence of events that will happen in a certain way. This hermit
than records these events, and that is what is left in "The Ramblings of a
Hermit". I would even like this Hermit to mention at the end that he can only
have faith that the vision he has are correct, and that he knows that he will
die. I want a principle feature of this also to be some set rules about the
afterlife, maybe it's not structured like heaven and hell, but rather in some
other way, and in this way the hermit will be able to see what is going on. So,
in this entirely absurd scenario, the hermit makes his manifesto, puts it away,
and proceeds to die. It is not until many decades later, long long after the
hermit has died, that these four characters find this manifesto, and they each
read it in their turn. I want in there to be the recording of some events which
happened before their time, and then I want there to be some mentions of
events, very specific events so as to eliminate ambiguity. I want these four
charcters to be called out by name, even, for their date of births to recorded,
even perhaps the names of their parents. I then want some event that these four
took part in together, that they took part in together, (perhaps they murdered
someone, ooooooh, I like that a lot) and I want the details of that event, that
murder, to be told out in detail. I then want these characters to discuss this,
and its implications. The conversation will have to be discovered, I could not
begin to write an outline for them, but essentially the whole point of this
work would be to write the interactions of these four characters as they
discuss the implications of these visions of the hermit. I only just came up
with the idea of murder, but that gives this story so much more weight. I love
it. It also entirely divorces my story from the actual mythology that I want to
create. So the ramblings of a hermit as I think about them now, compared to the
ramblings of *this* hermit, these two are entirely different hermits in
entirely different stories.

I like it, this story is starting to gain traction for me, and I am curious to
see where it could go.

Well, it is interesting, I have gone twenty minutes past my alloted time now.
It's amazing what I little water can do for the soul. I do think I will decide
to forgoe bread, PBJ, and milk, for at least a few days. I might add milk back
in and only at night just because I have some milk in my fridge right now and I
don't want it to go bad, but I don't feel bad throwing out the six or eight
slices of bread I have, and the peanut butter and jelly won't go bad, so I will
try and do better about sticking to this diet. I will combine it with IF as
well. So mushroom with avocado, beef, and some veggies, with tea and lots of
water (I'll have to figure out more veggies). I like it.

Now to Hearthstone.
