So this last weekend for me was certainly something of an experince.

I want to go over it from the beginning, but I feel guilty about not starting
any work. Let me finish my testing, check some of the new cases, and do some
other things before I go in detail about the weekend.

So I want to start writing down some names for breathing techniques that I have
used, or that I want to use soon.

Kundalini:
Ujjayi (Relaxed calm breathing)

Kapalbhati (exhale breathing)
Agni-Prasana (inhale breathing)
Bhastriki (bellows breathing)

Antar Kumbahaka (inhale retention)
Bahya Kumbahaka (exhale retention)

Brahmari (ohms)
Nadi Shodana (nose breathing)
Wim Hof (Agni-Prasana with retention)

Just writing this out makes me very excited. I feel as though I have tapped in
to something totally new and different with this.

Let's go on a blind date.

I don't have many pictures, but I promise I'm interesting.

Swipe right, then message me something you are really good at (skill, hobby,
whatever).
