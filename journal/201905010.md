So, right now, it is just before six in the morning. I have just taken another
fat hit, and I am still deciding what I want to do in the present.

In order to become faster at performing regular tasks, I will copy over the
address from this youtube video, that I am watching right now.

Okay, so TIL that the link must go first. The brackets are corner brackets
first, followed by the parens, followed by whatever the fuck you want.

That all being said, I'm not sure if these get imbedded in the final pandoc
documents.

Also, all of that being said, I am only something like three minutes in to my
writing session right now, but I already feel more comfortable than I have felt
in a long time. I like this set up a lot, actually. I will use it from now on.

Okay, so I just had an idea.

I am going to visit newegg, and I am going to look at cases. I am going to find
a "standard size" for a case.

From there, I am then going to build something of a desk, similar to the desk I
have built for myself now (and, since you can't see what I look like, I must
describe to you that I am sitting on a yoga block, at the intermediate height,
typing at my twenty inch box).

I like this set up.

I also like the idea of constructing it so that it can turn to different
heights.

Ideally, I'd like to be able to use it at three levels, but that might be
overthinking things.

But, I must say, this twenty inch height is near ideal for yoga block posture.
