So last night I had a dream. This dream takes place in a certain dream version
of Seattle. While I'm there, I decide I want to see what sort of extra
cirrucular activities UW has.

So I walk in to a place in UW which is similar to the opening of the activity
center, and I ask about their pool hours. The pool is just behind the front
desk, and the lady there says that the hours are posted on the wall to the
entrance to the pool, and to be careful because non students have different
hours than students.

So I go into the foyer room, and I check the flyer there. On it, I see hours in
the morning, and I check my watch and it's something like nine o clock, and the
hours from 9-11 are for the swim team practice, and then the general public
hours are just from 11-1, and then there is extra student hours after that. I
didn't check the rest of the thing except to see those hours weren't available
to the public. So I'm dissapointed now, because I presume that the public hours
are going to be crowded as fuck, so I continue on past the pool to see what
else there is.

As I go past, I see a bunch of different areas, which resemble something like
pleasure island from Pinnochio. There is something like an outdoor area with a
bunch of pools, and in between the pools are seperated by the regular concrete
barriers, then behind these pools, there is something of an arcade area.

The most prominent thing I remember in the dream is wanting to get across the
pools to the arcade, so I walk on one of the narrow barriars seperrating the
pools, but I have to be careful, because there are people going back and forth
across the way, in a parkour like manner, and I have to avoid them.

That's honestly about all that I remember in the dream. I remember when I get
across, there is someone there, and I talk to them. Fuck me there is quite a
bit more, probably the most important part.

So when I get across, I start talking with someone about stuff, and they show
me their collection of gems. They talk about how they have been collecting this
certain variety of headband, and on these headbands, there are gems. She goes
on to show me these gems, and how each headband has a certain gem, the largest
one, which is in the center of the band, and then two more on each side, for a
total of five, which are valuble gems, and worth keeping, and then the rest,
which are small and insignificant.

The dream then cuts to them peeling off the gems that are worth keeping into a
bucket, that spirals down into a container, and doing this for multiple
headbands, so that they have a whole container of gems that are worth keeping.

I look in to the bucket, and it's very beautiful. It's another sort of scene
where I am taken aback by it's beauty.
