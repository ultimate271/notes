So I am experimenting with something different today. I am writing from a
chair.

I am comfortable as can be, with a new chair, an arm rest, and two pillows for
my shoulder girdle position. I might have to readjust these pillows as the
session goes on, but for the moment I will leave them as can be.

Right now, I want to write about all of the things I think I could potentially
be missing from my Seth and Cain story.

The first, I think, is reference to the sun. In fact, I think there should be
refernce to the moon, especilaly in Cain's Demon's and perhaps in the chapters
precedinging that.

In fact, I like the idea of having something likea  blood moon in the sky, that
you can see at the some time as the setting sun. When they enter the Garden, I
want to use setting sun symob0lism with simultaneous rising moon.

Also, something els that I think is, at the very least, missing on some level,
is the ideas that.

So I don't know what I just typed above, but
