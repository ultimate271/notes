Short dream entry today, this dream took place in Colorado. I was there for a
vacation by myself, and I was walking around. I thought about how much I wanted
to go to a dispensary and buy some marijuana, but how I couldn't. As I was
there, Caitlin came out of a room with three of her girlfriends (other female
figures that are dream characters). I made eye contact, and she made eye
contact back, but we both kind of looked away. I said hi, and she struggled to
say hi back, and started walking along. I was then somewhat confused, and
interjected myself greatly by saying hello in a very articulated and forthright
manner, and I also remember saying something to the effect of, you're not going
to ignore me are you.

At this, we made conversation, and I asked her what she was doing out here, and
she said, "Oh, you know, just hit the dispensaries and getting really high, I'm
guessing just like you are," and I said, "Yeah, of course," even though it
wasn't true.

She could sense my dishonesty and said, "Well, you have a good time," and went
with her girlfriends across the way into another door.

It was a short fragment, and I woke up feeling defeated.
