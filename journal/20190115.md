Real quick about this dream.

So the dream was like fire emblem, and I was going through the prolouge phase
of the game, and I got to the second to last battle of the prologue, and I
remember thinking, "I wonder if I could finish this game with only the mages".
Then we got to the last episode of the prologue, and I remember thinking, "It
doesn't matter who dies, so I can just do this boss fight without worrying
about who dies." Well, a lot of people died, but I killed the boss, but then, I
got to the next chapter, and they were all still dead, and I remember thinking,
"well shit." That was the dream.
