So last night, I had something of a dream fragment. It wasn't quite a dream
fragment but it wasn't quite a full dream either, and how much I remember it
makes it closer to a fragment than a full on dream.

So it took place in a large outdoor area. There was some sort of convention
going on, and there were tents set up, and picnic tables, and all sorts of
stuff. I was helping with the convention, it had something to do with
maintaining property. In other words, the convention was something like a
landscaping convention, like a volunteer thing that was like a "get the
community together and help out" sort of thing.

All I really remember about the dream is that, at the end of the day as the sun
was coming down, we went into the tents, and I was hanging out with some of the
people there, and I was asked if I would like a beer. I said, "Yes, I would
love a beer" and I thought about how good a beer is after doing yardwork. I
grabbed a bottle of beer, and openned it and started sipping it, when I
remembered that I was still not allowed to have beer on the FODP. I looked at
my watch, and the date was the 28th, and I thought, "Uh oh, hopefully I'm not
going to be asked to test at the beginning of February, that would be bad." and
I thought I would hopefully have enough of a buffer to make it.

That was the extent of what I remember about the dream. I think there was more
to the dream about someone speaking at the main podium, but I don't remember
that, or what he said, or anything like that. It could also not be part of the
dream, so I don't know. That was all I remember.
