Right now I have just purchased a new bong, and a new lighter (hemp wick) and I
must say that the new lighter is a must have for anyone consuming marijuana
through a glass piece. I don't think it matters so much if you are rolling
joints, but for glassware, which is my preference, I prefer the hempwick
greatly to the other methods.

I have yet to test out how well the hempwick works with my regular bong, but
with by brand new and smaller bong, it works pretty well.

Also, I just want to take a moment and comment on how ridiculously bad this
music is. It's quite fascinating how bad some composers can make music.

It's quite honestly a complete insult to actual composers. I feel that putting
some wub wub in random ways that coincide with a four four time signiture does
not make you a good composer. Of course, my mind could be changed, but as yet,
it has not been.

So I am not entirely sure what I want to do right now. I kind of want to play
some Rez.

Let's do that.

So it is later now and I want to eat some food. But I'm not sure if it's food I
want to eat, or something else. I'm not sure at all.
