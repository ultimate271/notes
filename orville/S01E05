Summary
    The crew of the Orville encounters a Krill space vessel attacking a
    friendly, non-hostile farming planet, and orders the vessel to stand down.
    When they turn on them, the Orville's hand is forced into battle, and when
    they win, they are able to take a shuttle and salvage it. With this
    shuttle, starfleet comes up with the idea of putting the captain and the
    pilot into a stealth mission to infiltrate the Krill and discover as much
    as they can about them. While they are undercover on the vessel, they
    discover a bomb that is going to be used to destroy another innocent
    farming colony. In order to stop them, the captain figures out to turn up
    the lighting in their ship to full ultraviolet radiation which will melt
    the skin of the Krill. As they are arming this, they are discovered, but
    after saving the Krill children on the ship, they are able to kill all of
    the Krill on the ship and prevent the bomb from going off. Safely back on
    board the Orville, the captain speaks with a Krill lady they met on the
    ship, and the lady warns her that the children he saved will grow up with
    great contempt for what the captain did.
Review
    All in all a pretty okay episode. Had some interesting themes in there, in
    particular about religion and religous practices, but at the same time it
    felt very contrived and often times extremely silly.
