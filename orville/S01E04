Summary
    The orville sets out on a routine mission when it encounters a very large
    vessel. This vessel is the size of a large metropolitan area. This ship is
    led by a people who sought out on a multi generational space exploration
    mission, but whose engines and communications got wiped in an ion storm.
    For 2 millinea, they lived marooned, across generations, until the idea of
    an outside world became unknown to them. When the Orville encounters it,
    they get kidnapped, tortured, and witness mob brutality, but they find a
    rebllion that believes in them, and they bring the people power back to
    their engines and control back to their ship to go where they please.
Review
    A very well done episode, it works on the themes of religion while at the
    same time never feeling forced. However, I will say, for being a fully
    staffed attack vessel, many members of the Orville are captured or shot or
    otherwise outdone rather easily. Also, the concept of the outside world
    could have been easily proven by showcasing technological prowess well
    beyond anything their ship has seen, but this was never addressed nor
    practiced, which felt strange. Regardless, a good demonstration of dogma
    in the face of overwhelming evidence, to a point where a head would rather
    torture and kill rebelion members than hear them out and co-exist
    peacefully.
