<p>I want to see how many words I can type in one minuet. right now it is nine o three, and I just saw it turn to that ammount, os I figure when I watch and i see it turn to nine o four, then I can tell you when I am bale to type as mony words as you see on the page. Once I do a word count, I will have the number of words that I was able to type. it is still that time, and it has not changed yet. I don’t know when it will change,</p>
<p>That was it.</p>
<p>Word count 101. Char count 439.</p>
<p>Interesting, methinks.</p>
<p>9:06</p>
<p>This time I am making a consolidated effort to make larger and bigger and moister and much larger words. Confabulating words is my speciality at this point. I am the master and chef of all things culinary, and I am the king and ruler of all things conqueuror. I don’t even know how to spell taht word, but I am attempting to do so, and it is amusing.</p>
<p>I don’t know why I just decided to start a new parag</p>
<p>9:07</p>
<p>Word Count 80 Char count 412</p>
<p>I just want to warm myself u 9:08</p>
<p>Okay, I suppose I won’t warm myself uy to th estart tiem. I spuppose it will just start, and Iwan’t have any say in it. I think it is better if I close my eyes and don’t liook at teh words I am typing. When I focus on the time, I see something else entirely, I imagine, in ym third eye, the image of a clock, nad the second hand is going arodund and around like that, and everyt time tih second hand ticks, I t</p>
<p>9:09</p>
<p>I want to warm up now for some time. I want to continue to type at a rather steady pace, but when it gets to the point that it turns to the new time, I will type that new time, and I will get into it. And when I get into it, I will type something totally different than what I am typing now. or it could</p>
<p>9:10</p>
<p>be the same stuff that I am typing now. It dos’nt matter honest’ly whatvere I want tyo type will be good enough to type right now . THis is interesting, becasue when I fogcus on just going really fast like this. I get really sloppy, and when I get really sloppy, I get really slow, and since it is slow, I think to myself, “Why is it this sloppy, I know I gcon get it fast by not being slo</p>
<p>9:11</p>
<p>ppy like this, but I can’t do it, I must have some reason te be sloppy in order to justify my existance. But since it is sloppy, I must indicate something about the nature being sloppy to the world.</p>
<p>Being a sloppy person does not mean you are dirty It might mean that you have more propensity to being</p>
<p>9:12</p>
<p>dirty, but that doesn’t matter. It’s amazing to me how many words I can bring myself to type in such a short timespan. When I just force myself to get words out into the processor, it kind of just happens, and when that happens, I get to a point where I come to a conclusion about how I want to live my life, and what I need to do in order to get it all together. But it’s not about that at all, really,</p>
<p>9:13</p>
<p>It’s about containing your shit all inside a bag, and bringing it to the shit store, and selling. I have tried other methods of disposing of my shit, but those methods are inferior to this one, at least in my experience. Of course, flushing it down into the sewers is one way to eliminate your shit.</p>
<p>9:14</p>
<p>or at least, put it in the toilet and forget about it. But when you do this, all of your shit isn’t together. It all originated from the same place, but I think it would be silly to think that one turd in the sewers has anything to do with the other thing that I was talking about</p>
<p>9:15</p>
<p>Holy shit I lost my train of thought there, lets bring it back some. I was just talking about in a bit ago about something regarding shit, and I don’t know what the punch line meant to be, but I don’t think I arrived at it. But that’s fine, I don’t have to arrive at it, it’s just something that has to come out of the universe naturally, or something.</p>
<p>9:16</p>
<p>I was accused of praying yesterday. I was sitting on top of the parking garage, doing the wim hof method as one does, and meditating after that. I intended to sit for a total of about twenty minutes total, but at about fifteen minutes in, after I had finished the power breathes and was working on the silent meditation portion</p>
<p>9:17</p>
<p>Two security guards walked up to me, and asked me who I was, what I was doing here. I told them I was meditating, and they introduced themselves, and I said, “Oh, I’m sorry for the bother, I don’t want to worry anyone, but I find it a nice place to meditate. If I must find another place to sit</p>
<p>9:18</p>
<p>for some time then I can do that. To which they said, “Okay.” It felt like we had maybe a whole host of back and forth exchanges about “libaility” followed by “I understand completely” followed but, “Yes, of course, that’s great, but also, risk, anxiety, etc.” and I followed</p>
<p>9:19</p>
<p>that up also with things like, “Yes, I totally get it, if people are worried about me, then I shouldn’t be sitting here. I’m sorry you had to come all the way up here to deal with this.”</p>
<p>At around this point is when they started going back down, I removed myself from the seat, and</p>
<p>9:20</p>
<p>I went down to my car to put my bag back in it’s proper place. When I was doing that, I then decided to cut my meditation session some minutes short, because, well, it had to be, so I walked down the parking garage stairs. When I did that, I saw, coming out of the elevator as I got to the obttom of the stairs, the woman who confronted me at the top.</p>
<p>9:21</p>
<p>Of course, she felt compelled to continue her conversation, and said something like, “Oh, thank you so much for being understanding and cooperative, you must understand that it’s such a liability for us to have someone just sitting on top of the parking garage. We didn’t know if maybe you had to face a certain direction in relation to the sun, and that’s why you were sitting there</p>
<p>9:22</p>
<p>… And on and on with this sort of babble about costs and liabilities. All of the things she had already told me, and we had already said that we agreed about,</p>
<p>9:23</p>
<p>she told me all of these things again, and this time, I wanted to something to the tune of, “Yes, we already agreed on this” but when I said it, I redacted the word ‘already’ because it seemed in poor taste to include it.</p>
<p>9:24</p>
<p>10:08</p>
<p>Okay, so I’m not sure how I feel about putting timestamps all throughout my journal. I think it is something that I should do once I start, and once I end, and that way, what I can do is I can run a whole analysis on the entire block, and get a good running average, and the concept of variance of anything in beteween this block and another isn’t really that big of a deal.</p>
<p>I could run an anlysis and see, but I presume that it woul reveal that, while there are certainly some ponits that have faster speeds than others, there is genereally nothing that can be done about this. In facte, I would say quite the opposite is true. It should be the case that there are some points that you are able to type much more quiclky than others, mustoly becasue you have in your head the words that you want to see, and in some sense you act only a a dictator (of dictation) in reciting it down and putting in to the keyboard.</p>
<p>But what this ebb and flow represents is to things. One, typing quickly is exhausting, but it is exhausting on an entirely different dimension to type slowly and steadily over a long period of time. Two, it represents the fact there might be some things that I know I want to say, and when I get to a certain point, I must pause, and think through the things that I want to say. THis act of pausing, reconisdering, and continuing, I think is criticle to haveing a good stream of consciousness.</p>
<p>So for instance, to give a good example of this principle at work, I just gave a moment of pause right there, and allowed myself to take a bite of some food before I continued to write. But of course, I only have this much to write, and when I am finished chewing this bite of food, it will be about the time that I have nothing to talk about again.</p>
<p>I want to listen to music. THis is what I want to do. I want to post a link here, and then, based upon that link, I want to write something out, and when I read it back, I am curious how well the music will match up with what I write.</p>
<p>So let us go for that.</p>

<p>So I am listening right now. I have just started the piece. Right now all I hear is the standard theme.</p>
<p>I must admit, I have not listened to this version before, I have only listened to the one with teh lyrics.</p>
<p>I see there is a fragmented version of the main theme.</p>
<p>Now it’s filled in a little more.</p>
<p>I like the way it is building on top of itself.</p>
<p>This exact build up is I think uninteresting.</p>
<p>But this third time we’ve been introduced to the main theme is really dope.</p>
<p>The transistions are cool, but have nothing that I can tell off hand to do with the theme itself.</p>
<p>I like that we get a breakdown version of the theme again after the dubstep version.</p>
<p>Then of course, we go straight to the dubstep version again.</p>
<p>I like it without the lyrics. Because the lyrics were simply “You don’t know the power, of the Dark Side” over and over with little variation, and it was difficult to focus on the background with it there.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzbJMCSfcPY">Celldweller - The Imperial March (Star Wars Cover)</a></p>
<p>You don’t know the power, of the dark side.</p>

<p>You don’t know the power, of the dark side. You don’t know the power, of the dark side. You don’t know the power, of the dark side. You don’t know the power, of the dark side. You don’t know the power, of the dark side. You don’t know the power, of the dark side. You don’t know the power, of the dark side. You don’t know the power, of the dark side.</p>

<p>So I have been listening to this version now for about two minutes so far, and I must say that it’s interesting at the very least, but it reminds me of something going haywire with the sound system more than anything else. I like the usage of James Earl Jones voice in parts though, I’m curious where they got that sound byte from. I’m assuming that it was taken from the movie, but to extract it so beautifully I think is impressive.</p>
<p>So far, I am just sort of taken aback by the amount of times I have been teased by the theme, only to be followed up by some “sick techno beat” or whatever. It’s seems almost sacriligous in some ways. Of course, saying something like that is absurd, but what I mean is that I don’t think it totatlly fits what this theme should be. Well, it’s not even the imperial march theme all the time, it’s somethings this other, completely made up theme that seems to have nothing to do with starwars.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s a homage to Celldweller or something, I don’t know. I can’t be asked to provide a complete analysis on all of these works.</p>
<p>And it just sort of ended. I was not expecting that, but there you go. It’s done now.</p>
