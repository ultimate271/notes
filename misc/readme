So I use pandoc to generate pdf's for my notes. Currently, there is a project
in the works to organize my notes in a way that makes it programmitcally easier
to create documents based on very specific parameters, but until then this is
more than adequete for my purposes, (and if we're being totally honest, such a
system is counter-productive until the volume of notes becomes large enough to
necceccitate the overhead involved)

In order to set up the compilation environment, follow these steps (2018 April)

Download pandoc from https://pandoc.org/index.html
Download latex from https://miktex.org/download

After downloading miktex, open "miktex console" from the start menu, select
"Restart as Admin" from the file menu, then select updates from the left panel
and install all updates

After this, simply run one of the scripts (.bat file) and it should generate a
pdf in the appropriate folder
