An interesting way to think about this is that, each year, you have about a 1 in 26000 chance of losing a limb to trauma, and 1 in 22000 change of losing a limb to dysvascular disease. Combined together across forty years means that there is something like a 1 in 300 chance of losing any limb for any reason.
