# CHAPTER 39
Hrathen watched several Korathi priests lead the stunned princess from the
quiet room. “Such are the judgments of Holy Jaddeth,” he announced.

The duke, Roial, sat on the edge of the throne dais, head held between his
hands. The young Jindo baron looked as if he wanted to follow the priests and
demand Sarene’s release, and the martial Count Eondel was weeping openly.
Hrathen was surprised to realize that he took no joy from their sorrow.
Princess Sarene’s fall was necessary, but her friends were of no concern—or, at
least, they shouldn’t be. Why was he bothered that no one had shed tears at his
own fall before the Shaod?

Hrathen had begun to think that the poison would take effect too late, that the
surprise marriage between Sarene and Roial would go forward unchallenged. Of
course, Sarene’s fall would probably have been just as disastrous after the
marriage—unless Roial had intended to take the throne this very evening. It was
an uncomfortable possibility. One, fortunately, Hrathen would never have the
opportunity to see fulfilled.

Roial wouldn’t crown himself now. Not only did he lack the legal right, but his
fortune was still less than that of Telrii. Hrathen had checked the wedding
contract—this time a death was not the same as a marriage.

Hrathen pushed his way through the stunned crowd toward the exit. He had to
work quickly: Sarene’s potion would wear off in five days. Duke Telrii met
Hrathen’s eyes as he passed, nodding with a respectful smile. The man had
received Hrathen’s message, and had not acted against the wedding. Now his
faith would be rewarded.

The conquest of Arelon was almost complete.
