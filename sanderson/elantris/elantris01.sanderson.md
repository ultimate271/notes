## We are introduced to Elantris and the Shaod
Elantris was beautiful, once. It was called the city of the gods: a place of
power, radiance, and magic. Visitors say that the very stones glowed with an
inner light, and that the city contained wondrous arcane marvels. At night,
Elantris shone like a great silvery fire, visible even from a great distance.

Yet, as magnificent as Elantris was, its inhabitants were more so. Their hair a
brilliant white, their skin an almost metallic silver, the Elantrians seemed to
shine like the city itself. Legends claim that they were immortal, or at least
nearly so. Their bodies healed quickly, and they were blessed with great
strength, insight, and speed. They could perform magics with a bare wave of the
hand; men visited Elantris from all across Opelon to receive Elantrian
healings, food, or wisdom. They were divinities.

And anyone could become one.

The Shaod, it was called. The Transformation. It struck randomly—usually at
night, during the mysterious hours when life slowed to rest. The Shaod could
take beggar, craftsman, nobleman, or warrior. When it came, the fortunate
person’s life ended and began anew; he would discard his old, mundane
existence, and move to Elantris. Elantris, where he could live in bliss, rule
in wisdom, and be worshipped for eternity.

Eternity ended ten years ago.
