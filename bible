Brett Webster's Summary of the Bible
Forward
    The purpose of this document is twofold.

    Firstly, it is my intention to give a sort of outline to the bible as a
    whole, giving a concise list of all the stories and myths presented in the
    bible, particularly of the old testament, so that one could easily find
    whatever story one wants by browsing rather than searching. Along with this
    first purpose is to detail all of the relevant proper names, so that I
    might use them in the mythologies that I, Brett Webster son of Jerry, wish
    to create.

    The second purpose is to give a sort of cohesiveness to the tale of
    the bible as a whole. It is very easy to know of the classic stories from
    Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden to David and Goliath and Daniel and the
    Lions den and Esther and all the myriad of stories that are given in the
    bible, and not know how any of it relates to the geneology of Jesus and the
    movings of the Hebrew peoples throughout the classical eras. In this way, I
    wish to connect the dots, so to speak, of the line (or lines as it were) of
    flow of the peoples in the bible, and to give them a sort of place in
    history.

    Much in the way that an individual human is made up of many cells that live
    and die of their own throughout the life of the human, I feel that the
    peoples of the bible make a sort of living organism that feeds off of the
    land that it goes about, and that the individual stories in them give life
    to that organism as a whole, such that it begins its life with the story of
    Adam, reaches a sort of climax with the story of Jesus, and continues on
    through history after that, of which none is told of in the bible.

    I find the birth of Judism, its cousin Islam, and its inevitable Child
    Christianity, as all living, breathing organisms that were born in infancy
    around the 4000 bc agricultural era, and in studying them, we see these
    mythologies almost as hyper organisms, hive-mind like creatures that
    survived off of the myths and stories that sustain them, and in this way
    the myths almost come to life when the individuals that created them are
    thought of as cells in a much more vast and intricate web of thought and
    consciousness, and the gods and dieties of these peoples can almost come to
    life when thought of as a collection of the peoples that made them rather
    than something that is outside of the world that created it.

    Of course, one must be careful not to over-romanticize the thoughts and
    synethesia that leads imagining these super-organisms in this way, as
    really all I refer to is the history of the various peoples of the ancient
    era's and beyond, and to say that a group of people has life or
    consciousness beyond the individuals that make them up is no less absurd
    than saying that there is an invisible speghetti monster in the sky.
    However, I will say that, in whatever way consciousness exists in any
    individual, undeniable in the argument of "I think therefore I am", it is
    not unreasonable to say that, while these "super-organisms" of groups of
    peoples surely do not think in the same way that we as humans do, the
    figures of Gods and Angels and other Deities that are told in the mythology
    can be thought of as beings like ourselves in that they are made up of a
    sum that is greater than it's parts, and at the very least within the
    mythology of the stories that are told therein, these mythological beings
    have some sort of consciousness akin to ours. Alas, this is how it must be,
    for what better way for a human to understand another being but to make it
    like a human?

    But again, caution must be taken, as when one deals with mythology, one
    must always take care in seperating the myth from the real. For in
    mythology, one can better understand the real by understanding the myth,
    and likewise one can better understand the myth by understanding the real,
    but the real is never brought about by the myth (except in cases where the
    myth comes before the real and the peoples of the real wish to self-fulfil
    the myth by following it in a sort of psychopathic way, but this is the
    exception) and trying to draw conclusions about the real based upon the
    myth can only be done for amusements sake (or hypothesis) rather than for
    the sake of any academic rigor.

    However, in this way, one can see the marraige of History and Mythology,
    and the study of one without the other, while useful for record keeping
    purposes and indeed interesting enough in its own right, will only lead to
    a academic understading of each subject on its own, but in the study of
    both together can one see the true Beauty of each, as in their union only
    then can one come to understand the true Life of the Hiveminds that are
    created by them.
