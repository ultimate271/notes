# PARTICULAR FORMS OF ANOMALY: THE STRANGE, THE STRANGER, THE STRANGE IDEA AND THE REVOLUTIONARY HERO
Anomalous events share capacity to threaten the integrity of the known, to
disrupt the “familiar and explored.” Such events, while differing in their
specific details and manner of manifestation, tend to occupy the same natural
category. Threats to the stability of cultural tradition emerge in four
“mythologically inseparable” manners: through rapid natural environmental
shift, “independent” of human activity; through contact with a heretofore
isolated foreign culture; through application of novel (revolutionary)
linguistically or episodically mediated critical skill—the inevitable
consequence of increasing ability to abstract, learn and communicate; and as a
consequence of revolutionary heroic activity.

The “natural” human tendency to respond to the stranger, the strange idea and
the creative individual with fear and aggression can be more easily
comprehended, once it is understood that these diverse phenomena share
categorical identity with the “natural disaster.” The problem with this
“natural” response pattern, however, is that the upsetting capacity of the
anomalous is simultaneously the vital source of interest, meaning and
individual strength. Furthermore, the ability to upset ourselves—to undermine
and revitalize our own beliefs—is an intrinsic, necessary and “divine” aspect
of the human psyche (part of the seminal “Word” itself).

The Word—in its guise as painstakingly abstracted action and object—can create
new worlds and destroy old; can pose an unbearable threat to seemingly stable
cultures, and can redeem those that have become senescent, inflexible and
paralytic.

To those who have sold their souls to the group, however, the Word is
indistinguishable from the enemy.
