Archetypes of Response to the Unknown



The “contamination of anomaly with the threat of death,” attendant on the
development of self-consciousness, amplifies the valence of the unknown to a
virtually unbearable point. This unbearable amplification has motivated the
development of two transpersonal patterns of behavior and schemas of
representation, constituting the individual as such, embodied in mythology as
the “hostile brothers.” One of these “hostile brothers” or “eternal sons of
God” is the mythological hero. He faces the unknown with the presumption of its
benevolence—with the (unprovable) attitude that confrontation with the unknown
will bring renewal and redemption. He enter, voluntarily, into creative “union
with the Great Mother,” builds or regenerates society, and brings peace to a
warring world.

The other “son of God” is the eternal adversary. This “spirit of unbridled
rationality,” horrified by his limited apprehension of the conditions of
existence, shrinks from contact with everything he does not understand. This
shrinking weakens his personality, no longer nourished by the “water of life,”
and makes him rigid and authoritarian, as he clings desperately to the
familiar, “rational,” and stable. Every deceitful retreat increases his fear;
every new “protective law” increases his frustration, boredom and contempt for
life. His weakness, in combination with his neurotic suffering, engenders
resentment and hatred for existence itself.

The personality of this adversary comes in two forms, so to speak—although
these two forms are inseparably linked. The fascist sacrifices his soul, which
would enable him to confront change on his own, to the group, which promises to
protect him from everything unknown. The decadent, by contrast, refuses to join
the social world, and clings rigidly to his own ideas—merely because he is too
undisciplined to serve as an apprentice. The fascist wants to crush everything
different, and then everything; the decadent immolates himself, and builds the
fascist from his ashes. The bloody excesses of the twentieth century, manifest
most evidently in the culture of the concentration camp, stand as testimony to
the desires of the adversary and as monument to his power.

The pitfalls of fascism and decadence may be avoided through identification
with the hero, the true individual. The hero organizes the demands of social
being and the responsibilities of his own soul into a coherent, hierarchically
arranged unit. He stands on the border between order and chaos, and serves the
group as creator and agent of renewal. The hero's voluntary contact with the
unknown transforms it into something benevolent—into the eternal source, in
fact, of strength and ability. Development of such strength—attendant upon
faith in the conditions of experience— enables him to stand outside the group,
when necessary, and to use it as a tool, rather than as armor. The hero rejects
identification with the group as the ideal of life, preferring to follow the
dictates of his conscience and his heart. His identification with meaning—and
his refusal to sacrifice meaning for security—renders existence acceptable,
despite its tragedy.
