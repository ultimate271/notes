Как дела?
This is the Russian way to say, "how are things". This is the genitive form of
дело which literally means affairs. "How your affairs" would be the literal
translation.

Хорошо
Отлнчно
Both of these words are appropiate responses to Как дела? Good and excellent

Где ты вчера был?
This could be rephrased Где ты был вчера? but not Где был ты вчера. In russian,
questions do not reverse the subject and verb.

Я ездил на море.
ездил is the past form of ездить which means "to go" when it involves driving.
In this sense, though, it just means "I went". This is the abstract form of
ехать, you would use ехал if you were still there, but since you went there and
back, you use ездил. Also, море is the prepositional form of море, (they are
the same, since море is neuter)

О, как круто!

А как была водо?
"А" acts as a sort of informal transition. It "slurs" from the previous
sentence. And how was the water? is the way we do this in english

Ты купался?
Купался is the command form of купоться meaning "get in" when refering to
water. We use swim sort of like this, you can swim in a pool even if you don't
swim laps.

Вода была очень холодная, но я всё равно куполся.
холодная is the femenine form of холодный meaning frigid or cold. Всё равно is
an interesting combination of words. Wiktionary has them as both adverbs
meaning always and equally, so the best literal translation is "but I always
still swim". I'm curious about this combination.

А когда ты поедешь ещё раз
ещё раз seems to be it's own phrase. Literally it means "again time" but here
it could me "once more". The meaning of this phrase in english is "and when are
you going again" so that ещё раз takes the meaning of "again" in english.

На следующий недели. Хосешь поехать со мной?
The first statement is an answer to the question Когда? By next week. Следующий
is the participle of следовать which means "to follow", so it literally means
by the following week. Недели is also the genetive form of Неделя but it
doesn't quite make sense to me why this form is used. Also, the instrumental
form of я is used, со мной, which makes since because the person is doing
something "with me". (you) want to go with me. I also like this usage of the
infinitive поехать.

Да, с удовольствием!
Yes, I would love to! is the way that Liel translated this. Literally, it
means, "yes, with pleasure". It uses the instrumental form of удовольствие,
which makes sense. This is a common Russian phrase, and I like it a lot.

Супер! Давай возьмём с сабой пивка.
So wiktionary has Давай as an interjection. Translated literally, this sentence
would look something like "Super! Let's take with ourselves beer". This is the
first that I have seen сабой, it is the instrumental reflexive pronoun. It is
not tied to first second or third person, so I take that to mean it can be any?
I'm not sure. Also, пивка is just a fun way to say пиво
