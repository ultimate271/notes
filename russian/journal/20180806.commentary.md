Небо было голубым. Просто голубым. 

    Theses statements are very straight forward. The sky was blue. Just blue.
    I think the use of Просто here means to indicate that it was only blue,
    without clouds.

- Вы неплохо выглядите. Вам к лицу голубой цвет,- обронило ослепительно золотое
  солнце. 

    Translated literally, the first phrase is "You well look". This is a case
    where adverbs in Russian tend to preceed the verb. A more english sounding
    translation would be "you are well looking", and the proper translation
    would be "You look well". That is unfaithful to the Russian though, because
    in the english, "well" describes "you" and not "look" so there are some
    subtleties that are lost.

    I'm not sure what to make of the next sentence. Вам is the dative of вы,
    and лицу is the dative of лицо. Like wise, голубой цвет is the nominative
    of blue color, so it seems as though someone is trying to say the blue
    color is given to your face. "The blue color is to your face". I must be
    missing something.

    I think I know what I'm missing. The speaker is the sun, and the sun is
    speaking to the sky. обронило ослепительно золотое солнце translates
    literally to "fell the dazzlingly golden sun". The word золотое I think
    should be золотой. Actually, it's the neutor form of золотой, it's just not
    an entry in wiktionary.

- Благодарю.- Небо расправило складки своего голубого наряда и замерло в
  ожидании новых похвал. 

    Translation "I thank you." The sky smoothed out the creases of it's own
    blue attire and stood in waiting of new praises.

    So there is a lot going on this sentence.

    I think a more proper way of saying the spoken words would be Я благодарю,
    but this way I have read in places is accepted.

    The word расправило is the past tense of расправить which is derived from
    править which means to rule or govern. The prefix раз- seems to mean "to
    make asunder" which would make this word mean to govern wildly, but I think
    this has to be a case where the word has diverted from the original
    meaning. Расправило I think is best translated in this context to "smooth
    out"

    складки is the plural of складка, and in this context we know it's the
    accusative.

    своего голубого наряда is it's own phrase. All of these words are in their
    genetive forms.

    замерло в ожидании is pretty straightforward. The only thing I would say is
    that there is a sense of implied Небо. I think it would be not wrong to say
    и небо замерло в ожидании

    новых похвал is in the genetive plural. Here, this does not mean so much
    that the sky is possessing новые похвалы. I worder if this could be used in
    the accusative. I don't think so. I don't want to dwell on it too much.

Но их не последовало. Солнце уже беседовало с какой-то далекой звездой. 

    Translation: But they are not acting accordingly. The sun already talked
    with some far off star.

    Но их не последовало The only thing strange to me about this sentence is
    the use of plural genitive of они. I'm not sure why the genitive in this
    case, I feel it should be the nominative. "But of them they did not follow
    suit" might be the way to think about this concept in english. It's really
    interesting.

    The next sentence plays out as you would expect. Беседовало is the past
    form of беседовать. The interesting thing here is the use of какой-то.
    Looking at wiktionary, it seems to be it's own sort of phrase, acting like
    the english a/an. It declines like какой.

    I'm actually not sure what to make of this, as какой-то is the nominative
    form, but далекой звездой is the instrumental. Actually, I take that back,
    Какая-то is the nominative in the feminine, and then какой-то is the
    feminine instrumental.

- Вот как...- Небо растерялось.- Может быть, мои голубые одежды кажутся
  роскошному солнцу чересчур скромными? И солнце, похвалив меня, просто
  посмеялось? Напрасно... Ведь я все-таки небо! 

    Вот как... This I think makes the most senes as an interjection. Putting
    together вот как literally means "here how" which doesn't make sense in
    english. как is a very interesting preposition. Prepositions will be the
    most difficult to get a grasp on.

    растерялось is actually the neutor past of растеряться which is a strange
    verb, it is perfected, indicating that the sky was confused, not that he
    was generally confused

    Может быть This looks like a russian phrase, meaning "may be" Может is the
    он form of мочь so it might be possible to say оно может быть just as
    grammatically well, although this might be strange to a Russian ear.

    мои голубые одежды Translates quite directly to "my blue clothes".

    Кажутся is the present они form of казаться. This verb declines strangely
    to me. Rather, this verb is strange to me.

    роскошному солнцу is the dative of роскашный солнце, in english this is
    best described with the word "to the radiant sun"

    чересчур скромньми here it is clear that this translates to "too modest". I
    want to ask about the adjectives that are used as direct objects.
