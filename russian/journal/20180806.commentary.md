Небо было голубым. Просто голубым. 

    Theses statements are very straight forward. The sky was blue. Just blue.
    I think the use of Просто here means to indicate that it was only blue,
    without clouds.

- Вы неплохо выглядите. Вам к лицу голубой цвет,- обронило ослепительно золотое
  солнце. 

    Translated literally, the first phrase is "You well look". This is a case
    where adverbs in Russian tend to preceed the verb. A more english sounding
    translation would be "you are well looking", and the proper translation
    would be "You look well". That is unfaithful to the Russian though, because
    in the english, "well" describes "you" and not "look" so there are some
    subtleties that are lost.

    I'm not sure what to make of the next sentence. Вам is the dative of вы,
    and лицу is the dative of лицо. Like wise, голубой цвет is the nominative
    of blue color, so it seems as though someone is trying to say the blue
    color is given to your face. "The blue color is to your face". I must be
    missing something.

    I think I know what I'm missing. The speaker is the sun, and the sun is
    speaking to the sky. обронило ослепительно золотое солнце translates
    literally to "fell the dazzlingly golden sun". The word золотое I think
    should be золотой. Actually, it's the neutor form of золотой, it's just not
    an entry in wiktionary.

- Благодарю.- Небо расправило складки своего голубого наряда и замерло в
  ожидании новых похвал. 

    Translation "I thank you." The sky smoothed out the creases of it's own
    blue attire and stood in waiting of new praises.

    So there is a lot going on this sentence.

    I think a more proper way of saying the spoken words would be Я благодарю,
    but this way I have read in places is accepted.

    The word расправило is the past tense of расправить which is derived from
    править which means to rule or govern. The prefix раз- seems to mean "to
    make asunder" which would make this word mean to govern wildly, but I think
    this has to be a case where the word has diverted from the original
    meaning. Расправило I think is best translated in this context to "smooth
    out"

    складки is the plural of складка, and in this context we know it's the
    accusative.

    своего голубого наряда is it's own phrase. All of these words are in their
    genetive forms.
