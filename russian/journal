This document is for learning a word or so at a time, writing it a bunch, and
using it in russian sentences and such. When I learn more about conjugation and
such, I will include those cases as well, and as I get more familiar with
Russian, English will be used less and less.

I am going to start list some pronouns, because I know they will be used a lot

The first person pronoun "I" is represented in russian by

Я    ("I" am working)
Меня (That was "me")
Меня 
Мне  (
Мной
Мне

Upon further analysis, I have decided to use more concrete words, because I am
unsure about the specifics of such a fundamental pronoun.

Lets start learning vocabulary with family.

Отец (Father)
Отецы (Plural)
Отеца 
Отец
Отец
Отец


All right, so we're doing this again with a different approach.

Given a word, I want to be able to tell its gender, and the stem/conjugation of
it.

Lets start by going over the different cases.

Before I want to start talking about cases, I just want to list "The Seven
Letters" for the seven letter rule. The seven letter rule has to do with
letters that follow one of these seven letters.

Гг Кк Хх Жж Чч Шш Щщ

In the nomnitive case (the dictionary definition, or "stem" of the noun), if
the last letter of the word is a consonent or Й, the noun is masculine, the
feminine nouns will end with а or я, and neutral words will end with о or е.
If a stem ends with the soft sound ь, it can be either male or female, I'm not
sure how to tell. Also I'm not sure, but maybe words never end in э or ы or
etc., or something else.

It seems that plural words will end with ы or и for male/female cases, and with
а or я in neutral cases. Most masculine (plural) words will end with ы, which
is appended after the final consonant, and most feminine words with и, which
will replace the final vowel (or ь if so the case). So a masculine word ending
in й (or ь) has that letter replaced by и. ы is used for feminine words when
the word ends in а (unless it follows one of the seven letters, then use и
anyway). Neutral plurals will end with а or я, cooresponding to о or е endings
respectively (and always а if preceded by the seven letters).

As an aside, basically what this all boils down to is that plurals will
generally end with some sort of "ee" sound. Neutral word plurals will end with
an "ah" sound. In it's coarsest form, the male version of the ee sound is ы and
the female version is и, while the neutral sounds for "ah" are а and я. It is
also worth noting that а and я are the endings of the stems for feminine words.

Also, there is not a way to take an arbitrary string of Russian characters and
determine if the word is plural or not, although we can boil it quite a bit.
This is what we can deduce based on what we have so far. Any string that ends
in a consonent or Й is singular male. Any word that ends in ы or и is plural.
There is no way to determine outside of knowledge of vocabulary whether the
plural word is male or female. Any word that ends in а or я is either female
singular or neutral plural. Again, it seems there is no way to tell without
vocabulary.

Now lets on to the Accusative case. The Accusative case is not used much in
English (I was it) (It was me) (and you can see in these two examples "I"
transforms to "me" but "it" remains the same) but is used a little more
extensively in Russian. In fact, it is possible for the word to remain
unchanged in the accusative, so again there is no way to take an arbitrary
string and determine if it is accusative. The rules for unchanged accusatives
are convoluted. Inanimate Male words, female words ending in ь, and all neutral
words remain unchanged. For animate male words, either append а after a
consonent, or replace the vowel with я. For female words, replace а and я with
у and ю.

Okay, I don't know about you, but I am getting rather bored of this sort of
tedium and want a table or something.

I don't want to talk about plurals any more, and instead just want to talk
about singulars. Also patterns I've noticed.

Let's start with some pairs I've noticed. а and я go together (ah and yah), о
and е go together, ы and и go together. There are six cases, Nominitive,
Accusative, Dative, Genitive, Instrumental, Prepositional. Each one can be
pluralized, and is either male, female, or neutor (each of which has two
regular forms) giving 72 possibilities. This would best be placed on a table
of 12 rows and 6 columns, one column for each case and one row for each form,
along with a second set of rows for each plural form.

I am going to write out the Russian alphabet in order a few times, and then I
might even dabble with writing out Russian proper names as I see fit.
