WATSON

You lost your temper, Ullman had said.

“Okay, here’s your furnace,” Watson said, turning on a light in the dark, musty-smelling room. He was a beefy man with fluffy popcorn hair, white shirt, and dark green chinos. He swung open a small square grating in the furnace’s belly and he and Jack peered in together. “This here’s the pilot light.” A steady blue-white jet hissing steadily upward channeled destructive force, but the key word, Jack thought was destructive and not channeled: if you stuck your hand in there, the barbecue would happen in three quick seconds.

Lost your temper.

(Danny, are you all right?)

The furnace filled the entire room, by far the biggest and oldest Jack had ever seen.

“The pilot’s got a fail-safe,” Watson told him. “Little sensor in there measures heat. If the heat falls below a certain point, it sets off a buzzer in your quarters. Boiler’s on the other side of the wall. I’ll take you around.” He slammed the grating shut and led Jack behind the iron bulk of the furnace toward another door. The iron radiated a stuporous heat at them, and for some reason Jack thought of a large, dozing cat. Watson jingled his keys and whistled.

Lost your—

(When he went back into his study and saw Danny standing there, wearing nothing but his training pants and a grin, a slow, red cloud of rage had eclipsed Jack’s reason. It had seemed slow subjectively, inside his head, but it must have all happened in less than a minute. It only seemed slow the way some dreams seem slow. The bad ones. Every door and drawer in his study seemed to have been ransacked in the time he had been gone. Closet, cupboards, the sliding bookcase. Every desk drawer yanked out to the stop. His manuscript, the three-act play he had been slowly developing from a novelette he had written seven years ago as an undergraduate, was scattered all over the floor. He had been drinking a beer and doing the Act II corrections when Wendy said the phone was for him, and Danny had poured the can of beer all over the pages. Probably to see it foam. See it foam, see it foam, the words played over and over in his mind like a single sick chord on an out-of-tune piano, completing the circuit of his rage. He stepped deliberately toward his three-year-old son, who was looking up at him with that pleased grin, his pleasure at the job of work so successfully and recently completed in Daddy’s study; Danny began to say something and that was when he had grabbed Danny’s hand and bent it to make him drop the typewriter eraser and the mechanical pencil he was clenching in it. Danny had cried out a little . . . no . . . no . . . tell the truth . . . he screamed. It was all hard to remember through the fog of anger, the sick single thump of that one Spike Jones chord. Wendy somewhere, asking what was wrong. Her voice faint, damped by the inner mist. This was between the two of them. He had whirled Danny around to spank him, his big adult fingers digging into the scant meat of the boy’s forearm, meeting around it in a closed fist, and the snap of the breaking bone had not been loud, not loud but it had been very loud, HUGE, but not loud. Just enough of a sound to slit through the red fog like an arrow—but instead of letting in sunlight, that sound let in the dark clouds of shame and remorse, the terror, the agonizing convulsion of the spirit. A clean sound with the past on one side of it and all the future on the other, a sound like a breaking pencil lead or a small piece of kindling when you brought it down over your knee. A moment of utter silence on the other side, in respect to the beginning future maybe, all the rest of his life. Seeing Danny’s face drain of color until it was like cheese, seeing his eyes, always large, grow larger still, and glassy, Jack sure the boy was going to faint dead away into the puddle of beer and papers; his own voice, weak and drunk, slurry, trying to take it all back, to find a way around that not too loud sound of bone cracking and into the past—is there a status quo in the house?—saying: Danny, are you all right? Danny’s answering shriek, then Wendy’s shocked gasp as she came around them and saw the peculiar angle Danny’s forearm had to his elbow; no arm was meant to hang quite that way in a world of normal families. Her own scream as she swept him into her arms, and a nonsense babble: Oh God Danny oh dear God oh sweet God your poor sweet arm; and Jack was standing there, stunned and stupid, trying to understand how a thing like this could have happened. He was standing there and his eyes met the eyes of his wife and he saw that Wendy hated him. It did not occur to him what the hate might mean in practical terms; it was only later that he realized she might have left him that night, gone to a motel, gotten a divorce lawyer in the morning; or called the police. He saw only that his wife hated him and he felt staggered by it, all alone. He felt awful. This was what oncoming death felt like. Then she fled for the telephone and dialed the hospital with their screaming boy wedged in the crook of her arm and Jack did not go after her, he only stood in the ruins of his office, smelling beer and thinking—)

You lost your temper.

He rubbed his hand harshly across his lips and followed Watson into the boiler room. It was humid in here, but it was more than the humidity that brought the sick and slimy sweat onto his brow and stomach and legs. The remembering did that, it was a total thing that made that night two years ago seem like two hours ago. There was no lag. It brought the shame and revulsion back, the sense of having no worth at all, and that feeling always made him want to have a drink, and the wanting of a drink brought still blacker despair—would he ever have an hour, not a week or even a day, mind you, but just one waking hour when the craving for a drink wouldn’t surprise him like this?

“The boiler,” Watson announced. He pulled a red and blue bandanna from his back pocket, blew his nose with a decisive honk, and thrust it back out of sight after a short peek into it to see if he had gotten anything interesting.

The boiler stood on four cement blocks, a long and cylindrical metal tank, copper-jacketed and often patched. It squatted beneath a confusion of pipes and ducts which zigzagged upward into the high, cobweb-festooned basement ceiling. To Jack’s right, two large heating pipes came through the wall from the furnace in the adjoining room.

“Pressure gauge is here.” Watson tapped it. “Pounds per square inch, psi. I guess you’d know that. I got her up to a hundred now, and the rooms get a little chilly at night. Few guests complain, what the fuck. They’re crazy to come up here in September anyway. Besides, this is an old baby. Got more patches on her than a pair of welfare overalls.” Out came the bandanna. A honk. A peek. Back it went.

“I got me a fuckin cold,” Watson said conversationally. “I get one every September. I be tinkering down here with this old whore, then I be out cuttin the grass or rakin that roque court. Get a chill and catch a cold, my old mum used to say. God bless her, she been dead six year. The cancer got her. Once the cancer gets you, you might as well make your will.

“You’ll want to keep your press up to no more than fifty, maybe sixty. Mr. Ullman, he says to heat the west wing one day, central wing the next, east wing the day after that. Ain’t he a crazyman? I hate that little fucker. Yap-yap-yap, all the livelong day, he’s just like one a those little dogs that bites you on the ankle then run around an pee all over the rug. If brains was black powder he couldn’t blow his own nose. It’s a pity the things you see when you ain’t got a gun.

“Look here. You open an close these ducks by pullin these rings. I got em all marked for you. The blue tags all go to the rooms in the east wing. Red tags is the middle. Yellow is the west wing. When you go to heat the west wing, you got to remember that’s the side of the hotel that really catches the weather. When it whoops, those rooms get as cold as a frigid woman with an ice cube up her works. You can run your press all the way to eighty on west wing days. I would, anyway.”

“The thermostats upstairs—” Jack began.

Watson shook his head vehemently, making his fluffy hair bounce on his skull. “They ain’t hooked up. They’re just there for show. Some of these people from California, they don’t think things is right unless they got it hot enough to grow a palm tree in their fuckin bedroom. All the heat comes from down here. Got to watch the press, though. See her creep?”

He tapped the main dial, which had crept from a hundred pounds per square inch to a hundred and two as Watson soliloquized. Jack felt a sudden shiver cross his back in a hurry and thought: The goose just walked over my grave. Then Watson gave the pressure wheel a spin and dumped the boiler off. There was a great hissing, and the needle dropped back to ninety-one. Watson twisted the valve shut and the hissing died reluctantly.

“She creeps,” Watson said. “You tell that fat little peckerwood Ullman, he drags out the account books and spends three hours showing how we can’t afford a new one until 1982. I tell you, this whole place is gonna go sky-high someday, and I just hope that fat fuck’s here to ride the rocket. God, I wish I could be as charitable as my mother was. She could see the good in everyone. Me, I’m just as mean as a snake with the shingles. What the fuck, a man can’t help his nature.

“Now you got to remember to come down here twice a day and once at night before you rack in. You got to check the press. If you forget, it’ll just creep and creep and like as not you an your fambly’ll wake up on the fuckin moon. You just dump her off a little and you’ll have no trouble.”

“What’s top end?”

“Oh, she’s rated for two-fifty, but she’d blow long before that now. You couldn’t get me to come down an stand next to her when that dial was up to one hundred and eighty.”

“There’s no automatic shutdown?”

“No, there ain’t. This was built before such things were required. Federal government’s into everything these days, ain’t it? FBI openin mail, CIA buggin the goddam phones . . . and look what happened to that Nixon. Wasn’t that a sorry sight?

“But if you just come down here regular an check the press, you’ll be fine. An remember to switch those ducks around like he wants. Won’t none of the rooms get much above forty-five unless we have an amazin warm winter. And you’ll have your own apartment just as warm as you like it.”

“What about the plumbing?”

“Okay, I was just getting to that. Over here through this arch.”

They walked into a long, rectangular room that seemed to stretch for miles. Watson pulled a cord and a single seventy-five-watt bulb cast a sickish, swinging glow over the area they were standing in. Straight ahead was the bottom of the elevator shaft, heavy greased cables descending to pulleys twenty feet in diameter and a huge, grease-clogged motor. Newspapers were everywhere, bundled and banded and boxed. Other cartons were marked Records or Invoices or Receipts—SAVE! The smell was yellow and moldy. Some of the cartons were falling apart, spilling yellow flimsy sheets that might have been twenty years old out onto the floor. Jack stared around, fascinated. The Overlook’s entire history might be here, buried in these rotting cartons.

“That elevator’s a bitch to keep runnin,” Watson said, jerking his thumb at it. “I know Ullman’s buying the state elevator inspector a few fancy dinners to keep the repairman away from that fucker.

“Now, here’s your central plumbin core.” In front of them five large pipes, each of them wrapped in insulation and cinched with steel bands, rose into the shadows and out of sight.

Watson pointed to a cobwebby shelf beside the utility shaft. There were a number of greasy rags on it, and a loose-leaf binder. “That there is all your plumbin schematics,” he said. “I don’t think you’ll have any trouble with leaks—never has been—but sometimes the pipes freeze up. Only way to stop that is to run the faucets a little bit durin the nights, but there’s over four hundred taps in this fuckin palace. That fat fairy upstairs would scream all the way to Denver when he saw the water bill. Ain’t that right?”

“I’d say that’s a remarkably astute analysis.”

Watson looked at him admiringly. “Say, you really are a college fella, aren’t you? Talk just like a book. I admire that, as long as the fella ain’t one of those fairy-boys. Lots of em are. You know who stirred up all those college riots a few years ago? The hommasexshuls, that’s who. They get frustrated an have to cut loose. Comin out of the closet, they call it. Holy shit, I don’t know what the world’s comin to.

“Now, if she freezes, she most likely gonna freeze right up in this shaft. No heat, you see. If it happens, use this.” He reached into a broken orange crate and produced a small gas torch.

“You just unstrap the insulation when you find the ice plug and put the heat right to her. Get it?”

“Yes. But what if a pipe freezes outside the utility core?”

“That won’t happen if you’re doin your job and keepin the place heated. You can’t get to the other pipes anyway. Don’t you fret about it. You’ll have no trouble. Beastly place down here. Cobwebby. Gives me the horrors, it does.”

“Ullman said the first winter caretaker killed his family and himself.”

“Yeah, that guy Grady. He was a bad actor, I knew that the minute I saw him. Always grinnin like an egg-suck dog. That was when they were just startin out here and that fat fuck Ullman, he woulda hired the Boston Strangler if he’d’ve worked for minimum wage. Was a ranger from the National Park that found em; the phone was out. All of em up in the west wing on the third floor, froze solid. Too bad about the little girls. Eight and six, they was. Cute as cut-buttons. Oh, that was a hell of a mess. That Ullman, he manages some honky-tonky resort place down in Florida in the off-season, and he caught a plane up to Denver and hired a sleigh to take him up here from Sidewinder because the roads were closed—a sleigh, can you believe that? He about split a gut tryin to keep it out of the papers. Did pretty well, I got to give him that. There was an item in the Denver Post, and of course the bituary in that pissant little rag they have down in Estes Park, but that was just about all. Pretty good, considerin the reputation this place has got. I expected some reporter would dig it all up again and just sorta put Grady in it as an excuse to rake over the scandals.”

“What scandals?”

Watson shrugged. “Any big hotels have got scandals,” he said. “Just like every big hotel has got a ghost. Why? Hell, people come and go. Sometimes one of em will pop off in his room, heart attack or stroke or something like that. Hotels are superstitious places. No thirteenth floor or room thirteen, no mirrors on the back of the door you come in through, stuff like that. Why, we lost a lady just this last July. Ullman had to take care of that, and you can bet your ass he did. That’s what they pay him twenty-two thousand bucks a season for, and as much as I dislike the little prick, he earns it. It’s like some people just come here to throw up and they hire a guy like Ullman to clean up the messes. Here’s this woman, must be sixty fuckin years old—my age!—and her hair’s dyed just as red as a whore’s stoplight, tits saggin just about down to her belly button on account of she ain’t wearin no brassy-ear, big varycoarse veins all up and down her legs so they look like a couple of goddam roadmaps, the jools drippin off her neck and arms an hangin out her ears. And she’s got this kid with her, he can’t be no more than seventeen, with hair down to his asshole and his crotch bulgin like he stuffed it up with the funnypages. So they’re here a week, ten days maybe, and every night it’s the same drill. Down in the Colorado Lounge from five to seven, her suckin up singapore slings like they’re gonna outlaw em tomorrow and him with just the one bottle of Olympia, suckin it, makin it last. And she’d be makin jokes and sayin all these witty things, and every time she said one he’d grin just like a fuckin ape, like she had strings tied to the corners of his mouth. Only after a few days you could see it was gettin harder an harder for him to grin, and God knows what he had to think about to get his pump primed by bedtime. Well, they’d go in for dinner, him walkin and her staggerin, drunk as a coot, you know, and he’d be pinchin the waitresses and grinnin at em when she wasn’t lookin. Hell, we even had bets on how long he’d last.”

Watson shrugged.

“Then he comes down one night around ten, sayin his ‘wife’ is ‘indisposed’—which meant she was passed out again like every other night they was there—and he’s goin to get her some stomach medicine. So off he goes in the little Porsche they come in, and that’s the last we see of him. Next morning she comes down and tries to put on this big act, but all day she’s gettin paler an paler, and Mr. Ullman asks her, sorta diplomatic-like, would she like him to notify the state cops, just in case maybe he had a little accident or something. She’s on him like a cat. No-no-no, he’s a fine driver, she isn’t worried, everything’s under control, he’ll be back for dinner. So that afternoon she steps into the Colorado around three and never has no dinner at all. She goes up to her room around ten-thirty, and that’s the last time anybody saw her alive.”

“What happened?”

“County coroner said she took about thirty sleepin pills on top of all the booze. Her husband showed up the next day, some bigshot lawyer from New York. He gave old Ullman four different shades of holy hell. I’ll sue this an I’ll sue that an when I’m through you won’t even be able to find a clean pair of underwear, stuff like that. But Ullman’s good, the sucker. Ullman got him quieted down. Probably asked that bigshot how he’d like to see his wife splashed all over the New York papers: Wife of Prominent New York Blah Blah Found Dead With Bellyful of Sleeping Pills. After playing hide-the-salami with a kid young enough to be her grandson.

“The state cops found the Porsche in back of this all-night burger joint down in Lyons, and Ullman pulled a few strings to get it released to that lawyer. Then both of them ganged up on old Archer Houghton, which is the county coroner, and got him to change the verdict to accidental death. Heart attack. Now ole Archer’s driving a Chrysler. I don’t begrudge him. A man’s got to take it where he finds it, especially when he starts gettin along in years.”

Out came the bandanna. Honk. Peek. Out of sight.

“So what happens? About a week later this stupid cunt of a chambermaid, Delores Vickery by name, she gives out with a helluva shriek while she’s makin up the room where those two stayed, and she faints dead away. When she comes to she says she seen the dead woman in the bathroom, layin naked in the tub. ‘Her face was all purple an puffy,’ she says, ‘an she was grinnin at me.’ So Ullman gave her two weeks’ worth of walking papers and told her to get lost. I figure there’s maybe forty-fifty people died in this hotel since my grandfather opened it for business in 1910.”

He looked shrewdly at Jack.

“You know how most of em go? Heart attack or stroke, while they’re bangin the lady they’re with. That’s what these resorts get a lot of, old types that want one last fling. They come up here to the mountains to pretend they’re twenty again. Sometimes somethin gives, and not all the guys who ran this place was as good as Ullman is at keepin it out of the papers. So the Overlook’s got a reputation, yeah. I’ll bet the fuckin Biltmore in New York City has got a reputation, if you ask the right people.”

“But no ghosts?”

“Mr. Torrance, I’ve worked here all my life. I played here when I was a kid no older’n your boy in that wallet snapshot you showed me. I never seen a ghost yet. You want to come out back with me, I’ll show you the equipment shed.”

“Fine.”

As Watson reached up to turn off the light, Jack said, “There sure are a lot of papers down here.”

“Oh, you’re not kiddin. Seems like they go back a thousand years. Newspapers and old invoices and bills of lading and Christ knows what else. My dad used to keep up with them pretty good when we had the old wood-burning furnace, but now they’ve got all out of hand. Some year I got to get a boy to haul them down to Sidewinder and burn em. If Ullman will stand the expense. I guess he will if I holler ‘rat’ loud enough.”

“Then there are rats?”

“Yeah, I guess there’s some. I got the traps and the poison Mr. Ullman wants you to use up in the attic and down here. You keep a good eye on your boy, Mr. Torrance. You wouldn’t want nothing to happen to him.”

“No, I sure wouldn’t.” Coming from Watson the advice didn’t sting.

They went to the stairs and paused there for a moment while Watson blew his nose again.

“You’ll find all the tools you need out there and some you don’t, I guess. And there’s the shingles. Did Ullman tell you about that?”

“Yes, he wants part of the west roof reshingled.”

“He’ll get all the for-free out of you that he can, the fat little prick, and then whine around in the spring about how you didn’t do the job half right. I told him once right to his face, I said . . .”

Watson’s words faded away to a comforting drone as they mounted the stairs. Jack Torrance looked back over his shoulder once into the impenetrable, musty-smelling darkness and thought that if there was ever a place that should have ghosts, this was it. He thought of Grady, locked in by the soft, implacable snow, going quietly berserk and committing his atrocity. Did they scream? he wondered. Poor Grady, feeling it close in on him more every day, and knowing at last that for him spring would never come. He shouldn’t have been here. And he shouldn’t have lost his temper.

As he followed Watson through the door, the words echoed back to him like a knell, accompanied by a sharp snap—like a breaking pencil lead. Dear God, he could use a drink. Or a thousand of them.
